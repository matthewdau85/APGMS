# APGMS Readiness Scorecard

This prototype readiness score is derived from the Guardrails Rubric v1.0. Update the JSON file to reflect evidence gathered from CI, audits, and manual verification. A minimum composite of **7.0** is required before promoting a sandbox rail to partners.

Run `node tools/readiness-score.js` to recompute the weighted score using the rubric defaults.

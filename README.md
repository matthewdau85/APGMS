APGMS (Automated PAYGW & GST Management System)
APGMS is an open-source web application that automates the calculation, securing, and remittance of PAYGW (Pay As You Go Withholding) and GST (Goods and Services Tax) obligations for Australian businesses at BAS (Business Activity Statement) lodgment.
It integrates with payroll and point-of-sale systems, leverages designated one-way accounts for secure tax fund management, and provides compliance alerts and audit-ready reporting.

Features
Automated PAYGW & GST Calculations:
Real-time calculation engines for PAYGW and GST, based on payroll and POS data.

Secure Fund Management:
Supports transfers to designated one-way accounts, blocking unauthorized withdrawals.

BAS Lodgment Workflow:
Automates BAS-time fund transfers to the ATO, with pre-lodgment verification.

Compliance & Alerts:
Proactive alerts for discrepancies, insufficient funds, and upcoming deadlines.

Audit Trail & Reporting:
Dashboard for real-time compliance monitoring and generating audit/compliance reports.

Security:
Placeholder for MFA and encryption; easy to extend for production environments.

Getting Started
Clone the Repository

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd apgms

Install Dependencies

npm install

Run the Development Server

npm start

The app will start on http://localhost:3000

Build for Production

npm run build

Generate API Schema & Typed Client

The console APIs are documented via a generated OpenAPI spec so the front-end and back-end stay in sync.

```
npm run openapi
npm run client:gen
```

`npm run openapi` merges the annotated Express routes with the FastAPI schema (when available) and writes `openapi.json`. `npm run client:gen` consumes that schema to regenerate the typed API client used by React Query hooks.

Customization & Integration
Payroll/POS Integration:
The codebase is designed to be extended with real API connectors for payroll and POS providers.

Banking APIs:
Replace the mock bank transfer logic in src/utils/bankApi.ts with production-ready code for secure fund movement.

Compliance Reporting:
Expand the dashboard and reporting modules to integrate with external audit or government APIs as needed.

Security Notes
This starter template includes mock implementations for banking and fraud detection.

For production, implement:

Secure API integrations

MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

End-to-end encryption (e.g., AES-256)

Robust audit logs

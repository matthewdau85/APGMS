APGMS (Automated PAYGW & GST Management System)
APGMS is an open-source web application that automates the calculation, securing, and remittance of PAYGW (Pay As You Go Withholding) and GST (Goods and Services Tax) obligations for Australian businesses at BAS (Business Activity Statement) lodgment.
It integrates with payroll and point-of-sale systems, leverages designated one-way accounts for secure tax fund management, and provides compliance alerts and audit-ready reporting.

Features
Automated PAYGW & GST Calculations:
Real-time calculation engines for PAYGW and GST, based on payroll and POS data.

Secure Fund Management:
Supports transfers to designated one-way accounts, blocking unauthorized withdrawals.

BAS Lodgment Workflow:
Automates BAS-time fund transfers to the ATO, with pre-lodgment verification.

Compliance & Alerts:
Proactive alerts for discrepancies, insufficient funds, and upcoming deadlines.

Audit Trail & Reporting:
Dashboard for real-time compliance monitoring and generating audit/compliance reports.

Security:
Placeholder for MFA and encryption; easy to extend for production environments.

Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd apgms
   ```

2. **Install dependencies with pnpm**

   This workspace is configured for [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (see the
   `packageManager` entry in `package.json`). If pnpm is not enabled on your
   machine yet, run `corepack enable` once, then install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   # then edit .env.local as needed for your setup
   ```

   The variables in `.env.local` are described in detail in
   [docs/environment.md](docs/environment.md).

4. **Run the application**

   For the TypeScript development server with automatic reload:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   To run the compiled JavaScript output (after building):

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

5. **Build for production**

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

The default API server listens on <http://localhost:3000>.

### Available scripts

The root `package.json` exposes a few scripts you can run with `pnpm` (or
`npm run`/`yarn` if you prefer those CLIs):

| Script | Command | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | `tsx src/index.ts` | Start the TypeScript server with hot reloading during development. |
| `pnpm start` | `node dist/index.js` | Run the compiled server output (make sure to run `pnpm build` first). |
| `pnpm build` | `echo build root` | Placeholder build step; replace with a real bundler when you add one. |
| `pnpm typecheck` | `echo typecheck root` | Stub that you can expand to run TypeScript type checks in CI. |
| `pnpm lint` | `echo lint root` | Stub for linting. Hook up ESLint/biome/etc. as needed. |

Customization & Integration
Payroll/POS Integration:
The codebase is designed to be extended with real API connectors for payroll and POS providers.

Banking APIs:
Replace the mock bank transfer logic in src/utils/bankApi.ts with production-ready code for secure fund movement.

Compliance Reporting:
Expand the dashboard and reporting modules to integrate with external audit or government APIs as needed.

Security Notes
This starter template includes mock implementations for banking and fraud detection.

For production, implement:

Secure API integrations

MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

End-to-end encryption (e.g., AES-256)

Robust audit logs

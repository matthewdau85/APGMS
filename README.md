APGMS (Automated PAYGW & GST Management System)
APGMS is an open-source web application that automates the calculation, securing, and remittance of PAYGW (Pay As You Go Withholding) and GST (Goods and Services Tax) obligations for Australian businesses at BAS (Business Activity Statement) lodgment.
It integrates with payroll and point-of-sale systems, leverages designated one-way accounts for secure tax fund management, and provides compliance alerts and audit-ready reporting.

Features
Automated PAYGW & GST Calculations:
Real-time calculation engines for PAYGW and GST, based on payroll and POS data.

Secure Fund Management:
Supports transfers to designated one-way accounts, blocking unauthorized withdrawals.

BAS Lodgment Workflow:
Automates BAS-time fund transfers to the ATO, with pre-lodgment verification.

Compliance & Alerts:
Proactive alerts for discrepancies, insufficient funds, and upcoming deadlines.

Audit Trail & Reporting:
Dashboard for real-time compliance monitoring and generating audit/compliance reports.

Security:
Placeholder for MFA and encryption; easy to extend for production environments.

Customization & Integration
Payroll/POS Integration:
The codebase is designed to be extended with real API connectors for payroll and POS providers.

Banking APIs:
Replace the mock bank transfer logic in src/utils/bankApi.ts with production-ready code for secure fund movement.

Compliance Reporting:
Expand the dashboard and reporting modules to integrate with external audit or government APIs as needed.

Security Notes
This starter template includes mock implementations for banking and fraud detection.

For production, implement:

Secure API integrations

MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

End-to-end encryption (e.g., AES-256)

Robust audit logs

Inbound Data Simulator
----------------------
Use the TypeScript simulator in `tools/simulate_inbound.ts` to fabricate point-of-sale and payroll activity for a target BAS period. The script samples from the app’s mock data and emits CSV payloads for GST/PAYGW credits plus a companion settlement feed that mirrors production split-pay settlements.

1. Generate the CSV fixtures (run with `npx tsx` or `pnpm exec tsx`):

   ```bash
   npx tsx tools/simulate_inbound.ts \
     --period 2025-10 \
     --abn 53004085616 \
     --hours 720 \
     --pos-interval 1 \
     --payroll-interval 168 \
     --seed 42 \
     --out samples/sim-2025-10
   ```

   The command above produces `*_GST_credits.csv`, `*_PAYGW_credits.csv`, and a matching `*_settlements.csv` in `samples/sim-2025-10/`. Pass `--help` to the script for all tunable knobs (GST/PAYGW rates, POS batch size, settlement lag, etc.).

2. Seed the `periods` table once per `(abn, tax_type, period_id)` before replaying deposits:

   ```bash
   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "insert into periods (abn, tax_type, period_id) values ('53004085616','GST','2025-10') on conflict do nothing;"
   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "insert into periods (abn, tax_type, period_id) values ('53004085616','PAYGW','2025-10') on conflict do nothing;"
   ```

3. Stream the synthetic credits into the one-way account ledger and post settlement deltas on a timer:

   ```bash
   node reconcile_worker.js \
     samples/sim-2025-10/2025-10_PAYGW_credits.csv \
     samples/sim-2025-10/2025-10_GST_credits.csv \
     --settlement samples/sim-2025-10/2025-10_settlements.csv \
     --watch=5s
   ```

   Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop the watcher. Add `--loop` to keep recycling the credit queue or omit `--watch` to apply the CSVs once without delays. Use `--api-base` if the reconciliation API is not running on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

# Declarative rounding configuration consumed by app.rounding.
# Methods define their line-level rounding and the final aggregation/label step.
# GST follows the ATO instruction: round each line to cents (HALF_UP) then
# report BAS labels in whole dollars. PAYGW uses the table-specific rounding for
# each pay period before rounding BAS labels.

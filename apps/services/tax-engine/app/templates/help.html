<h2>PAYG-Withholding methods</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>ATO Table</b>: Apply current-year schedules/formulas. Update rules each 1 July.</li>
  <li><b>Formula (progressive)</b>: Uses bracketed rates in JSON; mirrors ATO tables.</li>
  <li><b>Percent simple</b>: percentage of gross (voluntary agreements).</li>
  <li><b>Flat + percent</b>: add an extra fixed amount to the base percent.</li>
  <li><b>Bonus (marginal)</b>: withhold bonus at marginal rate on top of regular.</li>
  <li><b>Net â†’ Gross</b>: solve gross to hit a target net using selected formula.</li>
</ul>
<h3>ATO rounding order</h3>
<p>
  Rounding rules live in <code>rules/rounding.yaml</code>. GST is rounded at the line
  level to the nearest cent (HALF_UP) before totals are rounded to whole dollars
  for BAS labels. PAYGW uses the per-period table rounding (weekly stays at cents,
  monthly rounds to whole dollars) before labels are rounded to whole dollars.

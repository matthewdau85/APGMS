# Writing Style Guide

- Prefer "Pay employees tax withheld" over "PAYG-W".
- Prefer "business tax (GST)" over "indirect tax".
- Use "bank transfer" instead of "egress".
- Write actions as verbs: "Release payment", "Fix mismatch".
- Keep sentences at or below 20 words; avoid acronyms unless defined.

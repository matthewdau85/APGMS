# Reconciliation

Reconciliation ensures PAYGW and GST figures align across payroll, sales and banking. APGMS automates
much of the heavy lifting but finance teams retain control over approvals.

## Daily process

1. Review the **Dashboard** summary for outstanding balances and overdue tasks.
2. Visit **BAS â†’ Reconciliation** to compare calculated obligations with actual transfers.
3. Use the drill-down tables to investigate mismatches by employee, channel or tax code.
4. Approve or reject system-generated adjustments so the ledger stays accurate.

## Exception handling

* Raise an item in **Errors** when the variance exceeds tolerance or data is missing.
* Attach screenshots, CSV extracts or commentary so auditors can follow the decision trail.
* Link the exception to a release if remediation requires configuration changes.

## Period close

* Lock the period once balances agree and evidence exports are saved.
* Trigger the BAS lodgment workflow with approvals from finance leadership.
* Store the reconciliation report with the official BAS submission package.

# Getting Started

Automated PAYGW & GST Management System (APGMS) keeps payment obligations visible while reducing
manual reconciliation. Use this guide to stand up a workspace and link the systems that provide
source data.

## 1. Create your workspace foundation

1. Configure legal identifiers such as ABN, trading name and contact channels in **Settings → Business Profile**.
2. Link the operating account, PAYGW saver and GST saver accounts so that automated transfers can
   draw from and return funds to the correct destinations.
3. Invite finance approvers and payroll operators if the workspace requires multi-person controls.

## 2. Connect revenue and payroll sources

* Link payroll systems (for example MYOB or QuickBooks) to feed withholding events.
* Connect sales channels so GST calculations stay accurate as revenue streams change.
* Map each source to a reporting mode so that the wizard applies the right collection rules.

## 3. Run the setup wizard

The wizard validates banking details, prompts for transfer frequencies, and checks for
ATO-mandated data points. Completing every step ensures automated tasks run without manual
intervention.

## 4. Review the dashboard

After setup the dashboard highlights:

* lodgment status for BAS and payroll submissions,
* cash required for upcoming obligations,
* alerts for overdue actions.

## 5. Next steps

* Review the other help topics for deeper workflows.
* Bookmark the in-product help drawer (⇧+/) for contextual answers.
* Visit the **Releases** article when promoting changes between environments.

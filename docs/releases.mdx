# Releases

Releases coordinate how configuration, integrations and automation changes move between
non-production and production environments.

## Release stages

1. **Draft** – Capture the intent of the change, impacted obligations and stakeholders who must
   approve.
2. **UAT** – Validate behaviour in an Advisory-mode workspace before automation triggers real-world
   transfers.
3. **Ready for production** – Secure approvals, attach evidence exports and schedule the change.
4. **Production** – Monitor the first automated cycle after deployment and roll back if needed.

## Managing releases in APGMS

* Use **Settings → Customisation** to prepare configuration changes, then attach screenshots to the
  release record.
* Integrations updated via **Integrations → Connections** inherit the release identifier so you can
  trace which version is active.
* Link evidence exports to releases so auditors understand the decision trail.

## Controls checklist

* Segregate duties: preparer, approver and deployer roles must remain distinct.
* Capture test results within the release card before promoting to production.
* If automation fails post-release, open the **Errors** workflow to coordinate remediation.

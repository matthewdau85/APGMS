# Prototype Assessment – APGMS Patent Build

## Overall Readiness (Mocked Prototype Scale)
- **Current maturity score: 3/10.** The React front end offers navigation, dashboards, and mock workflows, but critical production requirements (ATO DSP compliance, validated PAYGW/GST engines, secure integrations, and hardened backend services) remain unimplemented. Server-side patent flows contain placeholder SQL and missing business logic, so the system cannot execute real remittance or reporting.

## Key Features in Place
- **UI Shell & Navigation:** Multi-page React router layout with dashboard, BAS view, wizard, audit, fraud, integrations, and help sections to illustrate intended flows.【F:src/App.tsx†L16-L29】【F:src/components/AppLayout.tsx†L6-L47】
- **Mock Compliance Dashboards:** Static compliance indicators and BAS summary cards to communicate obligations and overdue states.【F:src/pages/Dashboard.tsx†L6-L79】【F:src/pages/BAS.tsx†L4-L79】
- **Illustrative Calculators & Workflows:** GST calculator, PAYGW estimator, wizard steps, fund-securing button, and compliance reports built from mocked utilities and data.【F:src/components/GstCalculator.tsx†L1-L35】【F:src/utils/gst.ts†L3-L6】【F:src/utils/paygw.ts†L3-L7】【F:src/components/FundSecuring.tsx†L1-L16】【F:src/components/ComplianceReports.tsx†L1-L16】
- **Patent-Oriented Backend Skeletons:** Express routes, Postgres schema, settlement parser hooks, anomaly gating, and RPT issuance flow stubs aligned with the patent narrative.【F:src/routes/deposit.ts†L1-L43】【F:src/routes/reconcile.ts†L1-L57】【F:src/rpt/issuer.ts†L1-L36】【F:src/evidence/bundle.ts†L1-L19】【F:migrations/002_apgms_patent_core.sql†L1-L35】

## Gaps and Issues
- **Mocked Logic Misstating Tax Rules:** GST calculator treats inputs as GST-inclusive yet multiplies by 10%, and PAYGW uses a flat 20% rate—neither matches current ATO guidance or published withholding tables.【F:src/utils/gst.ts†L3-L6】【F:src/components/GstCalculator.tsx†L11-L32】【F:src/utils/paygw.ts†L3-L7】
- **Backend SQL Placeholders Broken:** Key queries omit parameter markers (`$1`, `$2`, …) and cannot run, blocking deposits, RPT issuance, evidence packaging, and payment release flows.【F:src/routes/reconcile.ts†L20-L35】【F:src/rpt/issuer.ts†L8-L32】【F:src/evidence/bundle.ts†L4-L16】
- **Security & Compliance Features Missing:** No authentication, MFA, encryption, audit hash linking, role separation, or tamper-evident logging beyond comments. Bank integrations, STP lodgment, and PayTo rails remain console logs/mocks.【F:src/utils/bankApi.ts†L1-L19】【F:src/components/AppLayout.tsx†L41-L45】
- **Regulatory Currency:** Static reference data—no linkage to ATO APIs, legal updates, or indexation tables; bank holiday list empty; compliance claims in the UI are marketing text, not backed by controls.【F:src/scheduler/cutoffs.ts†L1-L18】【F:src/components/AppLayout.tsx†L41-L45】
- **Testing & Automation:** Pytest references exist in documentation, but no automated CI, acceptance criteria, or data fixtures are wired into the JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

## Recommended Next Tasks
1. **Stabilise Data Layer:** Correct SQL, add migrations for full patent state machine (gate transitions, anomaly logs, ledger balances) and create seed/test data. Introduce repositories/services with parameterised queries and transaction handling.
2. **Implement Accurate Tax Engines:** Replace flat-rate PAYGW and naive GST math with tables aligned to ATO withholding schedules, PAYG instalment logic, and GST reporting rules. Externalise rates for maintainability.
3. **Compliance & Security Hardening:** Add authentication, role-based access, multi-factor, encryption, and immutable audit trails. Ensure one-way accounts enforce non-withdrawal semantics and signatures meet patent claims.
4. **ATO DSP Alignment:** Map requirements (e.g., Digital Service Provider Operational Framework) to features—STP v2 payloads, PLS messaging, secure key storage, penetration testing, privacy and data residency controls.
5. **Automation & Integrations:** Wire real payroll/POS connectors, bank APIs (NPP/PayTo/BPAY/EFT), and BAS lodgment endpoints. Implement anomaly detection thresholds, reconciling settlement imports, and RPT issuance with verifiable signatures.
6. **Regulatory Update Pipeline:** Create jobs to fetch and version ATO rate changes, calendar updates, and legislative amendments; surface effective-dated configurations across calculators and workflows.
7. **Testing & Certification:** Build unit/integration tests, acceptance journeys (including patent-critical paths), and prepare documentation for ATO certification, privacy impact assessments, and security audits.

## Alignment With Patent Intent
- The repository now contains patent-aligned concepts (gate states, RPT tokens, one-way accounts, anomaly thresholds). However, flows are skeletal and require substantive logic, validation, and security controls to reflect the patent claims end-to-end.

## Next Brief for ChatGPT Collaborators
- Maintain focus on delivering a patent-complete, ATO-compliant PAYGW/GST automation platform. Prioritise production-grade backend services, accurate tax computations, secure banking integrations, and auditable processes over UI polish. Ensure every new feature is justified against the patent scope and DSP obligations.

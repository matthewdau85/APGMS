# Modes

Modes describe how APGMS should interpret incoming transactions and obligations. They keep
automation predictable when business processes vary by channel or employee type.

## Operating modes

| Mode | Primary use | Notes |
| ---- | ------------ | ----- |
| Real-time | Stream data from integrated payroll or POS tools for immediate withholding. | Ideal when APIs push events as they happen. |
| Batch | Upload CSV or manual journals on a schedule. | Use for legacy systems without live integrations. |
| Advisory | Track obligations without triggering transfers. | Great for modelling new business units or sandboxes. |

## Selecting a mode

* **Wizard** steps prompt for a mode per revenue stream.
* **Settings → Payroll & Sales** lets you adjust assignments after onboarding.
* Switching from Advisory to Real-time recalculates standing transfer schedules so no obligation is
  missed.

## Governance tips

* Keep sandbox or UAT workspaces in Advisory to prevent unintended banking activity.
* Document who can promote a workspace to Real-time in the Releases process.
* Pair modes with alerts in **Settings → Notifications** so stakeholders know when automation
  changes.

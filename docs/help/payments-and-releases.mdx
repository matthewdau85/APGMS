Keep PAYGW and GST liabilities in lockstep with payroll and sales activity:

- `/api/balance` surfaces the ledger balance for a given ABN, tax type, and period.
- `/api/ledger` returns full transaction history for audit trails.
- `/api/deposit` records incoming PAYGW or GST funds into the quarantined buffer.
- `/api/pay` and `/api/release` instruct the payments rail to remit funds to the ATO when a reporting period closes.
- `/api/close-issue` finalises the RPT token and captures the compliance evidence bundle for the period.

Always double check the `amountCents` sign: deposits must be positive, releases must be negative to prevent accidental overdrafts.

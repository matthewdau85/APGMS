Set up dashboards and alerts so issues are surfaced before deadlines:

- `/readyz` is the liveness probe for the portal API, returning the server timestamp when healthy.
- `/ato/status` tracks the connectivity state with the ATO digital services gateway.
- `/openapi.json` exposes the merged contract for the public API surface; watch for drift after deploys.

Combine these probes with `/metrics` from the main service to create a single source of truth for observability.

# Ledger management

The ledger tracks every inflow and outflow for a period.

- Call `GET /api/balance` to return the latest running balance. The response includes the last update timestamp so you can spot
  staleness.
- Use `GET /api/ledger` for the full transaction list when reconciling statement exports.
- Credit funds with `POST /api/deposit`. The request body enforces positive `amountCents` values to protect against accidental
  reversals.

Deposits and releases appear in chronological order and power the evidence bundle that `GET /api/evidence` exports.

Welcome to **APGMS**. New organisations should walk through the setup wizard to capture legal identifiers, link bank accounts, and configure the PAYGW and GST buffers before any liabilities accrue.

1. Visit the **Dashboard** and confirm your next BAS due date.
2. Launch the **Setup Wizard** to enter your ABN, trading details, and payroll providers.
3. Link operating and buffer accounts so automated transfers can keep withheld taxes quarantined.
4. Use the wizard's confirmation step to review compliance status and confirm everything is ready.

> The `/health`, `/dashboard/yesterday`, and `/metrics` endpoints provide quick status checks for monitoring and should return 200 when the platform is ready.

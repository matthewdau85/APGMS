# PayTo sweeps

PayTo lets APGMS prefund outgoing disbursements from linked mandate accounts. The flow combines a proactive sweep with
asynchronous settlement notifications.

## Kick off a sweep

Submit `POST /api/payto/sweep` with the ABN, debit amount and reference that matches the mandate agreement. The service will
reserve the PayTo window and respond immediately when the sweep request is accepted by the banking rail.

## Track settlement

Banking partners confirm the outcome by calling `POST /api/settlement/webhook`. The webhook payload references the same
`sweep.reference`, along with the status and timestamp so you can reconcile the release window. Store the callback data alongside
ledger entries to keep the audit trail intact.

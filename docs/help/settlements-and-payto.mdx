Automate inbound settlement handling and evidence capture:

- Use `/api/payto/sweep` when a PayTo agreement needs to sweep excess balances back to your operating account.
- `/api/settlement/webhook` ingests settlement CSV payloads from banking partners and returns the number of rows processed.
- `/api/evidence` composes the compliance bundle (including RPT tokens and reconciliation data) for downstream archiving.

Settlement webhooks should be protected with signing middleware and replay protection to satisfy ATO audit expectations.

# Close and issue

When reconciliation tasks are done, advance the period to `READY_RPT` so an RPT can be minted.

Invoke `POST /api/close-issue` with the ABN, tax type and period ID. The endpoint enforces that outstanding discrepancies have
been resolved before it will update the state machine.

Once the call succeeds, proceed with RPT issuance and subsequent release activity.

# Reconciliation Pass Tokens (RPT)

Reconciliation Pass Tokens (RPTs) are the green-light artifacts that unlock outbound flows once a period has reconciled. An RPT
contains the ABN, tax type, period, and an Ed25519 signature that downstream services verify before moving funds.

## Operational sequence

1. Close the period after resolving anomalies with `POST /api/close-issue`. This transitions the ledger to `READY_RPT` so an RPT
   can be issued.
2. Issue the token via the console or automation. The signed payload is persisted alongside the ledger snapshot.
3. Present that token when invoking `POST /api/pay` for the release service or `POST /api/release` for the payments proxy. Both
   endpoints verify signature freshness and expiry before debiting the one-way account.

## Failure handling

If the RPT has expired or is missing, the release endpoints return a `400` with an explanatory error. The recovery path is to
re-issue a fresh RPT for the same period and retry the `POST /api/pay` or `POST /api/release` call.

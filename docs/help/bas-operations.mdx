Business Activity Statements can be rehearsed and submitted programmatically:

- Call `/bas/preview` to retrieve calculated PAYGW and GST totals for the current period.
- Validate a draft with `/bas/validate` before presenting it to officers for sign-off.
- `/bas/lodge` submits to the sandbox ATO gateway and echoes a success message when accepted.
- `/normalize` can be used to reshape source transactions so they align with your lodgment schema before posting.

Record BAS confirmations in the audit log and attach the portal reference number to your reconciliation evidence bundle.

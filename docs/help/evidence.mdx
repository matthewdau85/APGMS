# Evidence bundles

Auditors and compliance reviewers consume the signed payload that proves the ledger matches external statements. Use
`GET /api/evidence` with the ABN, tax type and period ID query parameters to download the ZIP archive of receipts, checksums and
signature manifests.

The endpoint enforces the same access control as the console. Rotate credentials that can reach `GET /api/evidence` in line with
internal compliance policies and alert if a bundle is requested outside your normal cadence.

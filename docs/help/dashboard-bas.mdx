## Overview

The Business Activity Statement (BAS) dashboard surfaces PAYGW and GST lodgment milestones alongside payment status in one consolidated view. Each card tracks:

- **Lodgments** — upcoming or overdue forms for each quarter.
- **Payments** — PAYGW and GST remittances that remain outstanding.
- **Compliance score** — weighted indicator of lodging and paying on time.

## Actions

Select **View BAS** to open the BAS workspace with prefilled activity statements. APGMS syncs your latest transactions nightly so the dashboard reflects the last reconciliation cutover.

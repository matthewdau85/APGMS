Link payroll, POS, and banking providers so APGMS can automate compliance:

- `/connections` lists active authorisations and can be polled to confirm the state after onboarding.
- Initiate new OAuth-style handshakes with `/connections/start` and direct users to the returned URL.
- Remove stale credentials with `/connections/{conn_id}` to enforce least-privilege access.
- `/transactions` surfaces harmonised transactional feeds that drive GST and PAYGW calculations.
- `/settings` persists security controls like retention windows and PII masking toggles.

Ensure each provider connection is subject to multi-factor authentication and rotate secrets on a set cadence.

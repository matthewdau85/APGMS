# Releases

Releases move funds from the one-way account to the beneficiary after controls have cleared.

- Use `POST /api/pay` when orchestrating a release directly from the console workflow. Attach the RPT, idempotency key and
  target account metadata.
- Use `POST /api/release` when calling through the payments proxy for service-to-service automation. The payload matches the same
  structure and still requires a valid RPT signature.

Both endpoints debit the ledger atomically and append a release entry that is reflected by `GET /api/balance` and `GET /api/ledger`.

Real-time PAYGW Tokens (RPT) authenticate secure exchange of withholding remittance totals with APGMS. Each token represents a daily PAYGW package signed with your AUSkey-equivalent certificate.

### Lifecycle

1. The payroll connector generates the token payload hourly.
2. APGMS validates the signature against your registered AUSkey.
3. When accepted, the PAYGW remittance queue updates immediately, allowing just-in-time BAS submissions.

> Tip: Rotate RPT credentials on the same cadence as your AUSkey rotation policy. Use the **Integrations â†’ Security** page to issue new client secrets.

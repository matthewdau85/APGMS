# Health monitoring

Expose `GET /health` to load balancers and orchestration tools so they can drain traffic if the app becomes unhealthy. The
endpoint returns `{ "ok": true }` when the service loop is running.

Combine the health probe with checks on dependent services such as the database, message bus and release queue to catch partial
failures before they impact release operations.

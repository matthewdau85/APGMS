# APGMS implementation: what we have vs what we need

| Capability area | What we have now | What we still need |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Automated PAYGW & GST calculations | Front-end calculators call flat-rate PAYGW and GST helpers that work only on manual inputs entered in the UI components.【F:src/components/PaygwCalculator.tsx†L1-L78】【F:src/components/GstCalculator.tsx†L1-L38】【F:src/utils/paygw.ts†L1-L7】【F:src/utils/gst.ts†L1-L6】 | Real-time calculation engines that ingest payroll and POS feeds instead of relying on manual input, as described in the starter feature list.【F:README.md†L5-L8】 |
| Secure fund management | A Secure Funds button invokes mock transfers into PAYGW/GST one-way accounts through stubbed banking helpers that always succeed.【F:src/components/FundSecuring.tsx†L1-L16】【F:src/utils/bankApi.ts†L1-L19】 | Production-ready banking integrations that truly lock down one-way accounts and prevent unauthorised movements, per the stated requirements to replace the mocks.【F:README.md†L9-L10】【F:README.md†L62-L64】 |
| BAS lodgment workflow | The lodgment card checks mocked balances, submits placeholder STP payloads, and records the result in in-memory history and audit logs.【F:src/components/BasLodgment.tsx†L1-L58】 | Automated BAS-time verification and fund movement backed by real services and ledgers, as the workflow description calls for.【F:README.md†L12-L13】 |
| Compliance & alerts | The dashboard flags overdue lodgments/payments and shows a compliance score derived from hard-coded state.【F:src/pages/Dashboard.tsx†L5-L98】 | Proactive discrepancy and insufficiency alerts tied to live data sources, matching the proactive alert requirement.【F:README.md†L15-L16】 |
| Audit trail & reporting | The Audit page and compliance reports list mock history entries rather than system-of-record logs.【F:src/pages/Audit.tsx†L1-L39】【F:src/components/ComplianceReports.tsx†L1-L17】 | Audit-ready reporting that integrates with external systems, as highlighted in the feature and customization guidance.【F:README.md†L18-L19】【F:README.md†L65-L66】 |
| Security & governance | Settings only exposes toggle placeholders, while the banking helpers return success without enforcing controls.【F:src/pages/Settings.tsx†L3-L177】【F:src/utils/bankApi.ts†L1-L19】 | MFA, encryption, secure APIs, and robust audit logs mandated by the starter’s security notes.【F:README.md†L21-L22】【F:README.md†L68-L79】 |
| Data sources & integrations | Application state is seeded from mock payroll, sales, and BAS history arrays.【F:src/context/AppContext.tsx†L1-L23】【F:src/utils/mockData.ts†L1-L19】 | Real payroll/POS connectors and API integrations envisioned in the customization roadmap.【F:README.md†L58-L66】 |

title: Balance endpoint

# GET /api/payments/balance

Use this read-only endpoint to check the running balance for an One-Way Account period. It queries the ledger in descending order
and totals deposits and releases for the requested ABN, tax type and period.

## Request

- **Query string:**
  - `abn` – required 11 digit ABN.
  - `taxType` – required tax stream (e.g. `PAYGW`, `GST`).
  - `periodId` – required identifier such as `2025-Q4`.

## Response

```
{
  "abn": "12345678901",
  "taxType": "PAYGW",
  "periodId": "2025-Q4",
  "balance_cents": 120000,
  "has_release": true
}
```

- `balance_cents` is the current balance after summing deposits and releases.
- `has_release` becomes `true` as soon as a release has been recorded for the period.

## Errors

- `400` when any required query argument is missing.
- `500` if the ledger query fails.

# Vulnerability & Penetration Testing

## Continuous Scanning
- Dependabot (weekly) and Snyk (daily) monitor dependencies; findings triaged in Jira SEC backlog.
- Container image scans executed in CI for each release branch; gating policy blocks `HIGH` severity or above.

## Third-party Penetration Testing
- Vendor: **Red Granite Security**.
- Scope: Customer portal, admin APIs, infrastructure perimeter.
- Cadence: Annual full assessment + targeted retest after critical changes.
- Latest engagement completed **2025-08-22**; full PDF stored at `ops/compliance/pentest/latest_pentest.pdf` and uploaded by the `compliance:daily` workflow artifact.

## Remediation Workflow
1. Findings logged in Jira (SEC project) with SLA based on severity.
2. Fix verification requires dual approval and corresponding change record.
3. Closure validated via automated regression tests and referenced in the compliance report.

## Proof of Practice
- `npm run compliance:daily` validates the PDF is present and includes the vendor name in the generated report.
- `/ops/compliance/proofs` exposes `last_pentest_date` for quick freshness checks.

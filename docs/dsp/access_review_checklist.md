# Access Review Checklist (Prototype Environment)

**Purpose:** Ensure that only authorized team members retain access to the APGMS sandbox while accreditation work is in progress.

## Quarterly Review Steps
1. Export current access lists from identity provider groups mapped to APGMS roles.
2. Verify each user's business need with their manager and project sponsor.
3. Confirm that offboarded staff have been removed from all groups and API credentials revoked.
4. Document any exceptions with compensating controls and planned remediation dates.
5. Capture reviewer signatures (digital acknowledgement is acceptable during prototype).

## Roles in Scope
- Platform Administrators
- Compliance & Assurance Analysts
- Support Engineers (Sandbox only)
- Read-only Stakeholders participating in pilots

## Evidence to Retain
- Access export files (CSV or PDF)
- Signed review checklist
- Tickets created for remediation tasks
- Updated roster of privileged users

Status: **Prototype** â€“ repeat the checklist monthly until DSP accreditation and production readiness are complete.

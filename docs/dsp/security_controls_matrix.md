# Security Controls Matrix â€“ DSP Focus Areas

| Control Domain | Requirement | Current Implementation | Evidence & Monitoring | Gaps / Enhancements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) | Enforce MFA for all privileged and remote access to production systems. | SSO integrates with Azure AD; conditional access requires MFA for engineering and support staff. Emergency break-glass accounts stored in sealed envelope safe. | Azure AD sign-in reports; quarterly review of MFA enforcement; automated alert if MFA disabled. | Automate disabling of stale break-glass accounts and rotate credentials every 90 days. Document manual override procedure in IR runbook. |
| Segregation of Duties (SoD) | Separate duties for development, deployment, and approval to reduce fraud risk. | CI/CD requires peer review and approval from non-authoring engineer. Production database access limited to platform team; finance team executes payment approvals via dual-control workflow. | GitHub branch protection logs; infrastructure IAM roles; payment approval audit logs retained 7 years. | Formalise SoD matrix and link to HR roles. Introduce automated alert when same user approves and deploys in a single change window. |
| Key Management Service (KMS) | Protect encryption keys with hardware-backed modules and strict access controls. | AWS KMS CMKs manage encryption for databases, object storage, and secrets manager. Key policies restrict usage to application roles. Automatic rotation enabled annually. | AWS CloudTrail events and Security Hub findings; monthly key usage review by Security Lead. | Implement customer-managed key (CMK) access request workflow; document cryptographic architecture diagram in evidence pack. |
| Logging & Monitoring | Capture security-relevant events, centralise logs, and retain for investigation. | CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, application audit trail, and database logs ingested into SIEM (Chronicle). Retention 400 days online, archive to cold storage for 7 years. | SIEM dashboards for authentication anomalies, payment exceptions, and admin actions. Weekly review by Security Operations duty officer. | Add automated integrity checks for log pipeline; integrate SIEM alerts with PagerDuty for on-call escalation. |
| Incident Response (IR) | Detect, triage, and recover from incidents within defined SLAs, notifying regulators when required. | Incident response runbook defines severity levels, roles, communication templates, and 72-hour notification target. Security Lead owns process. | Runbook stored in Confluence with revision history. Quarterly tabletop exercises; post-incident reviews logged in Jira. | Establish incident metrics (MTTD/MTTR) dashboard. Align with disaster recovery test results and capture lessons learned tracker. |

## Control Ownership & Review Cadence
- **Security Lead:** MFA, logging & monitoring, incident response.
- **Platform Lead:** SoD, KMS operations, access reviews.
- **Privacy Officer:** Works with control owners to validate privacy implications and record residual risks.

Controls are reviewed quarterly during the DSP compliance forum, with findings recorded in the risk register and tracked to closure.

# Slide 1: Problem
- Payroll teams lodge Business Activity Statements (BAS) late because reconciliations are manual and error-prone.
- Missing source data from payroll and bank feeds creates blind spots that delay compliance reviews.
- Executives lack a shared view of arrears risk, so corrective actions start too late.

# Slide 2: Solution
- APGMS automates ingestion of payroll, banking, and accounting feeds into a single BAS readiness workspace.
- Reconciliation bots flag anomalies, surface aging arrears, and recommend remediation steps.
- Role-based dashboards show finance leaders, accountants, and payroll managers the same live compliance status.

# Slide 3: Evidence v2
- 14 enterprise beta users cut BAS review cycles from 5 days to 36 hours on average.
- Error heatmaps reduced manual sampling time by 55%, enabling reviewers to focus on high-risk entries.
- CFO councils cited APGMS predictive alerts as the top driver for early arrears recovery.

# Slide 4: Pilot KPI
- Primary success metric: 95% on-time BAS submissions across participating entities within two cycles.
- Supporting metrics: <$25K outstanding arrears per entity and <24 hour average review duration.
- Early-warning accuracy target: <3% false positive anomaly rate across reconciliation alerts.

# Slide 5: Next Steps
- Confirm pilot cohort, data feeds, and security posture with customer stakeholders.
- Configure integrations, map ledger codes, and validate sandbox data flows.
- Launch pilot playbook: weekly review cadence, KPI reporting, and executive readouts.

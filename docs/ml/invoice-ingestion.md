# Model Card â€“ Supplier Invoice Ingestion

**Objective.** Pre-fill GST split candidates from supplier invoices via OCR/NER so operators can approve or
correct entries quickly. Outputs are advisory and require confirmation before syncing to ledgers.

**Architecture.** OCR/NER pipeline stub that tokenises invoice text, identifies supplier names, invoice
numbers, GST codes, and gross amounts. Provides extracted fields plus overall confidence.

**Training Data.** Synthetic supplier invoices augmented with public ATO sample data. No personally
identifiable information is stored.

**Evaluation.** Field-level precision/recall on supplier name, invoice number, GST code, and amount. Confidence
tuning validated with operator review sets.

**Limitations.** Free-text invoices may evade the heuristic extractor. Human review is mandatory before
posting any accounting entries.

**Governance.** Advisory tag, override persistence, explainability logging, and the `FEATURE_ML` flag keep the
feature within compliance guardrails.

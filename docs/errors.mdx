# Errors

Errors capture issues that require human intervention so APGMS stays compliant even when external
systems fail.

## When to raise an error

* Transfers rejected by the bank or payments that exceed account balances.
* Missing payroll submissions, late sales uploads or API outages from source systems.
* Variances discovered during reconciliation that cannot be auto-resolved.

## Workflow

1. Create an error record with context, impacted obligation and severity.
2. Assign an owner and due date. Attach screenshots or exports that assist in remediation.
3. Monitor resolution progress on the **Fraud & Errors** page and capture final outcome notes.

## Links to other modules

* From **Reconciliation**, convert a variance directly into an error for tracking.
* **Releases** must reference any open errors before deployment proceeds.
* Evidence exports automatically include the audit history of related errors.

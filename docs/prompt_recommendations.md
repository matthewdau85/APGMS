# Prompt Task Recommendations

This document reviews the proposed prompt tasks and provides guidance on whether to adopt them as-is, amend them, or complement them with additional efforts.

## 1. MFA, Encryption, and Audit Logging (Production Grade)
- **Recommendation:** Proceed with the task largely as written.
- **Suggested Amendments:**
  - Clarify how recovery codes are surfaced to users and require explicit download/acknowledgement flows.
  - Document operational runbooks for key rotation and MFA incident handling alongside the code changes.
  - Add a regression test that exercises the MFA step-up flow on a representative protected endpoint (e.g., allow-list update) to guard against future regressions.
- **Additional Considerations:**
  - Ensure the KMS abstraction supports per-environment providers (AWS, GCP, or HashiCorp Vault) through configuration rather than code changes.
  - Include monitoring alerts for append-only audit hash discontinuities and MFA challenge anomalies.

## 2. Hardened Banking Integration with Allow-Lists and Receipts
- **Recommendation:** Adopt the task with minor clarifications.
- **Suggested Amendments:**
  - Define explicit SLAs for retries/backoff and document circuit breaker thresholds so operators know when manual intervention is required.
  - Specify how idempotency keys are generated and persisted across distributed services to avoid collisions.
  - Require integration tests that cover mTLS-enabled calls using stub certificates to ensure TLS configuration drift is detected in CI.
- **Additional Considerations:**
  - Add observability hooks (metrics and structured logs) for each adapter call, including latency, retry counts, and breaker state transitions.
  - Ensure receipts are cryptographically signed or hash-linked to the audit chain for end-to-end integrity.

## 3. Roadmap to EVTE-Ready Release
- **Recommendation:** Publish the roadmap with concrete timelines and owners as proposed.
- **Suggested Amendments:**
  - Include risk mitigation strategies per phase (e.g., dependency on ATO data refresh cadence, KMS provisioning lead time).
  - Add explicit Go/No-Go checklists that reference required artifacts and sign-off authorities.
  - Establish review cadences (e.g., fortnightly steering meetings) to keep the roadmap current.
- **Additional Considerations:**
  - Capture key dependencies in a RACI matrix so responsibilities are clear across engineering, compliance, and operations.
  - Plan for retrospective checkpoints after each phase to incorporate learnings into subsequent work.

## 4. Operator Tooling for DLQ Replay, Anomaly Explainers, and Evidence Export
- **Recommendation:** Move forward with the task, ensuring alignment with operator workflows.
- **Suggested Amendments:**
  - Define authorization scopes for operator actions (view, retry, ignore) and ensure MFA + dual-approval policies are enforced consistently.
  - Provide UX mocks or acceptance screenshots to guarantee usability before implementation.
  - Include rate limiting or batching constraints for DLQ retries to avoid overwhelming downstream systems.
- **Additional Considerations:**
  - Instrument analytics to track operator interactions and resolution times, enabling continuous improvement of tooling.
  - Integrate anomaly explanations with an audit trail so decisions are reviewable during audits.

## 5. Secrets Management, Incident Response, and Environment Hardening
- **Recommendation:** Implement as described, with further elaboration on compliance requirements.
- **Suggested Amendments:**
  - Ensure the secret-fetching boot logic includes caching with automatic rotation and failure fallbacks.
  - Add tabletop exercise templates and post-incident review forms to the incident runbook.
  - Extend CI security scans to include container image scanning and infrastructure-as-code policy checks.
- **Additional Considerations:**
  - Introduce continuous compliance monitoring (e.g., AWS Config rules) aligned to the hardened posture.
  - Provide training material for engineers on secure secret handling and incident escalation paths.

## Additional Tasks to Consider
- **Privacy Impact Assessment:** Conduct a formal privacy review covering data minimization, retention policies, and cross-border data transfers.
- **Chaos and Resilience Testing:** Schedule quarterly resilience drills (fault injection, dependency outages) to validate recovery plans and SLOs.
- **Customer Communication Templates:** Prepare standardized communications for security events, banking disruptions, and roadmap milestones to keep stakeholders informed.
- **Continuous Control Monitoring:** Implement automated checks that validate MFA enforcement, log redaction, and audit chain integrity in staging and production on a daily cadence.

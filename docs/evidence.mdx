# Evidence

APGMS aggregates records from payroll, sales and banking systems so you can evidence compliance
quickly. Use this guide to understand what is stored and how to access it.

## Evidence sources

1. **Payroll events** – Gross wages, PAYGW withheld, superannuation contributions and submission
   timestamps.
2. **Sales events** – GST collected per channel, exemptions applied and adjustments.
3. **Bank transfers** – Automated movements between operating, PAYGW and GST accounts.
4. **User actions** – Configuration changes, approvals and overrides captured in the audit log.

## Retrieving evidence

* Navigate to **Audit → Evidence register** in-product to filter by period or obligation type.
* Export CSV packages for auditors; each bundle includes human readable summaries plus raw machine
  data.
* The Help drawer surfaces relevant evidence tips when opened from the Audit page.

## Best practices

* Store downloads in your DMS with retention aligned to ATO requirements (generally five years).
* Use the **Errors** workflow when data is incomplete so exceptions are tracked and resolved.
* Pair exports with the Releases process to capture sign-off before obligations are lodged.

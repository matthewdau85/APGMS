The construction should provide the same security properties as provided by ISO PIN blocks; the method used to format the PIN block prior to encryption should not enable the PIN to be recovered from the resulting ciphertext (e.g., by using rainbow tables73); ensure that any PIN translation conforms to the guidance in ISO 9564.1, but only to the extent that such guidance is consistent with the Issuer's security and risk management policies; If control numbers are used then ensure that the association of Cardholder authentication credentials with the control number does not weaken the principle that the control number cannot be used to determine a specific account;74 use only cryptographic algorithms specified in ISO 9564.2 to provide PIN secrecy and integrity; and75 ensure that clear text PIN transmission does not contain any information that can be directly connected with the Cardholder or the account/card number.

If an Issuer wishes to implement a new SCD for which a Letter of Approval is not held, the Issuer must arrange for that device to be approved in accordance with the Device Approval Process.77 4.3 Device management Security Control Modules (Host Security Modules) 78 SCMs shall be managed in accordance with the requirements of AS 2805.14.2. The Sponsor must submit to the committee of management an annual compliance statement confirming compliance with Annexures A.3, C.3, E.3 of this Volume 2 and either H.4 or H.5 of AS 2805.14.2 (in respect of any SCMs employed in the implementation of Interchange Transactions. Annexure B.3 of Volume 1 used in connection with the Annual Security Audit (see IAC Code Set Volume 1 (Introduction and Member Obligations), provides the required confirmation. Key Loading and Transfer Devices (KLDs, KTDs) Devices used in the initial cryptographic key loading of SCMs or PEDs must be managed in accordance with the requirements of AS 2805.14.2. The Sponsor must submit to the committee of management an annual compliance statement confirming compliance with Annexes A.3, E.3 and F.3 of AS 2805.14.2 in respect of any devices employed in the initial loading and transfer of SCM or PED cryptographic keys (see Annexure B.3 of Volume 1 (Introduction and Member Obligations used in conjunction with the annual Security Audit programme (see IAC Code Set Volume 1 (Introduction and Member Obligations)), provides the required confirmation. 76 Deleted effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 77 Amended effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 78 Amended effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 4 DEVICE SECURITY STANDARDS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 26 4.4 Security Control Module - limitations on functions [Deleted]79 4.5 Remote management of Security Control Modules This clause applies to systems which support remote access for the management of SCMs. SCM access requirements SCMs must be located in a secure, protected network, separate from generic internal or external access; there must not be uncontrolled connections between general internal and external networks; SCMs must be accessible only to authorised hosts and authorised applications; for TCP/IP implementations: the SCM environment must be protected at a minimum by an IPS or IDS between the perimeter network firewall and the remote management device; stateful firewalls must protect all external entry points to the SCM environment; such firewalls must log and monitor all inbound and outbound traffic to the SCMs. there must be a procedure, which is audited on a regular basis, for the rapid disablement of known/suspected compromised remote management devices. Management of SCM Remote Management Solutions Remote Management Solutions (“RMS”) may only be used with AusPayNet approved SCMs; all SCM RMS must have been approved in accordance with the Device Approvals Process;80 remote management devices may only be deployed in a minimally controlled environment, a controlled environment or a secure environment

For a high-level update on the progress of the ISO 20022 Industry Migration Program, please refer to our recently published issue of Migration Monitor on our website . Economic crime update Toby Evans, AusPayNet’s Head of Economic Crime, recently attended the inaugural Global Anti-Scam Summit in Brussels. The Summit challenged industries, governments, and law enforcement agencies to collaborate and find the ‘golden eggs’ to mitigate scams. Toby participated in the Global State of Scams panel, chaired by Glen Prichard, from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s Chief of Crime and Money Laundering. The panel included representatives from Brazil, Nigeria, the Netherlands and Singapore. In describing Australian trends, successes and challenges, Toby shared insights on the whole of ecosystem approach to mitigating scams through public-private partnerships, including the National Anti-Scam Centre, Economic Crime Forum, Open Intelligence Loop and the upcoming Scam Codes. Australia is the only country to observe an overall reduction in scams, and Toby outlined key initiatives, including stronger onboarding, risk-based friction, targeting mule accounts, telecommunications blocking, website takedowns, and recent action by law enforcement. He stressed the importance of expanding on the recent Communique and building global collaboration, specifically data sharing and disruption. Toby also participated in a session on developing global best practices, and presented on Australian initiatives. Australia is now a world leader in tackling scams by promoting hygiene across the digital economy, rather than regulating one sector alone. There were important learnings shared by other participants: New Zealand continues to lead the way in advertising consumer awareness, using humour to achieve cut-through. Also in New Zealand, Netsafe has developed an AI-driven bot that engages with scam emails to waste scammers’ time. Their data suggests they wasted five years of scammers’ time in six weeks The Dutch Banking Association described their money laundering watch list of known mules. Identified mules are added to a watch list for eight years. The list allows identified entities to be banked while ensuring adequate monitoring and safeguards. This is an initiative that could be considered for future anti-money laundering (AML) submissions.

At that meeting, we celebrated the fact that the Council was three years old and acknowledged the importance of the Council to AusPayNet’s work. It was also a time to review the composition of the Council, ensuring it focuses on engaging with and getting feedback from end-user groups and peak industry bodies. As a result of the review, NSW State Government and CHOICE have been added to the Council. We look forward to hearing the views of these important stakeholders on topical payments issues. At the same meeting, we sought feedback on the following topics: The winding down of the cheques system Industry's transition away from the BECS Framework AusPayNet's role in cash Our payments policy priorities. The Council’s feedback and perspectives will then be presented back to AusPayNet’s Board in August. Member events The AusPayNet team recently hosted two Member events. The first was an online webinar in June, providing insights and Members’ views on the potential role of the payments industry when it comes to environmental sustainability. Ninety-four attendees joined the webinar, which was followed by the publication of the AusPayNet insights paper, ‘ Reducing the Environmental Cost of Payments ’. The second was our first in-person event in Melbourne, which was hosted at ANZ Docklands in July. More than 50 Members attended the session, which focused on providing insights on Treasury's transformation initiatives and the proposed PSP licensing regime. We look forward to offering more Member events in the coming months, with our next interstate event to be held in Q1 next year.

its reference point the centre pixel (refer Figure B-1). It has been determined that the appropriate ratio is 0.2 and the following formula is applied where R is the % reflectance. DCR = (R area average – R centre pixel) R area average If the DCR is less than or equal to 0.2, the pixel is made white. If the DCR is more than 0.2, the pixel is black. Within a limited range this is a linear relationship, but the following cut off points are used with reference to the centre pixel:  If the centre pixel’s reflectance is less than 20%, it is always black.  If the centre pixel’s reflectance is more than 70%, it is always white. To determine the effect the background has on the legibility of the data to be retained, this bitmap information is used to measure the potential for interference, which is termed “background clutter”. For this purpose, a scoring system is used based on an area 0.010” square which contains 9 pixels. If, within this area, 6 or more of the 9 pixels are black, it is termed a Paxel. Refer Figure B-2. Whilst individual Paxels do not create a legibility problem, where they are aggregated together the joint effect may cause interference. It has been determined that within an Area Of Interest, which is a box of 0.25” high by the length of the Area, a string of more than 8 touching Paxels will cause a problem. Refer Figure B-3. A background in an AOI where Paxel strings of more then 8 occur is thus out of specification.

This will make character identification simpler and more positive, thus improving the first time read rate and reducing operator intervention. In turn this will result in faster processing of documents. Recommended for cheques: $ Open rectangle style Recommended for deposits: Rectangle with split $ cents Individual hand print $ boxes for each character entry position. $ Individual hand print boxes plus decimal point and tick mark for thousands $ Individual hand print boxes plus decimal point and tick mark every three digits Lines for the field guides are to be printed as scan non-readable. A decimal point is not to be pre-printed on cheques. Where the Total Amount is hand-written on deposit forms, a decimal point is to be pre- printed as scan readable. Amended effective 06/99 Recommended Specifications for Hand Print Boxes  Width (inside) 3/16” (4.75mm)  Height (inside) 1/4” (6.25mm)  Delimiters Width 1/32” (0.75mm)  Triple delimiters are used to separate dollars from cents. Amended effective 06/99 Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 57 AusPayNet September 2017 Appendix D $ Sign Representation The dollar sign must be represented by a character that conforms to certain dimension and ratio rules, as shown below, to enable it to be recognised by CAR systems. The OCR B font dollar sign at point sizes 16 and 18 conforms to these requirements. Alternatively, if this font is not available, it is preferred that the style of the font used is san serif as this will aid recognition, e.g. Arial or Helvetica. Amended effective 06/99 The pre-printed dollar sign must have:  a single vertical line through an upper case "S"  the vertical line must be between 0.013" (0.33mm) and 0.017" (0.43mm)wide  the recommended height to width ratio is 1.5:1 (aspect ratio)  the aspect ratio must be between 1:1 and 2:1  the height must be between 0.150" (3.81mm) and 0.200" (5.08mm) Typographical errors in the measurements corrected 06/99  the width must be between 0.075" (1.91mm) and 0.200" (5.08mm) Aspect ratio $ 0.150” (3.81mm) to 0.200” (5.08mm) 0.075” (1.91mm) to 0.200” (5.08mm) 1 : 1 Minimum Typographical errors in the measurements corrected 06/99 1.5 : 1 Recommended 2 : 1 Maximum Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 58 AusPayNet September 2017 Appendix E Amended, effective 19/05/08 1. Approval/Authorisation Scenarios The approval processes and related flow charts that follow describe the four-standard approval/authorisation scenarios that have been developed. These are:  Approval of new design with MICR  Base design approval  New document with approved base design  Reprint with no changes. The requirements are also detailed for design approval and allocation of a Design Approval Number (DAN) as well as the requirements for MICR/Colour authorisation and allocation of a Printing Approval Number (PAN). 1.1 Approval of New Design with MICR Refer also Scenario 1 flow chart Assumptions Request initiated by the customer who engages an artist and/or trade printer (TP).

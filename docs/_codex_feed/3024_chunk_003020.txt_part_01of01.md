criteria, and are there different types of e- commerce which merit different conditions of trust? The following paragraphs discuss certificate types and how they may be used to identify, evaluate, and authorize parties to a transaction. Please note while all certificate types may be able to meet the PCI DSS requirements for encryption of transmissions over public networks, certain certificates may not always be appropriate for a particular circumstance. For example, one type of certificate may be practical in the context of a typical business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce transaction (i.e., a website accessed by a person with a browser or mobile device), but may not apply for machine-to-machine (e.g., B2B) or an automated API-based transaction where a human is not involved. In the latter, the digital certificate is there to provide only encryption, not authentication. Only recommendations on the use of digital certificates are being presented; it will be up to the merchant to determine ultimately, which type of certificate best meets its needs. Historical Perspective In the early days of the Internet, the only type of SSL certificate available was an OV certificate. With this type of certificate, the CA would validate certain business information along with the domain name to ensure not only the chain of trust but also that the entity “is who it says it is.” For example, to purchase a website certificate for example.com, Example Inc. would send the CA some information from the web server along with proof that it was a real company. In addition, the person requesting the certificate was verified to be an employee of the company. The CA would validate this data (this could take 2-5 business days) and then issue the certificate to the organization for the website. This worked fine for many years but some organizations complained about the time involved to verify business details and wondered whether someone could come up with a quicker solution that still provided the necessary encryption. In the early 2000s, a new type of certificate, called DV, appeared on the market. This certificate was issued very rapidly because it required only that the applicant evidence its ability to use a domain name; there was no validation or verification of any other business information. For example, if someone purchased the domain www.example.com, they could obtain a DV SSL certificate for that domain Information Supplement • Best Practices for Securing E-commerce • April 2017 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 38 simply by applying to a CA and responding to an e-mail sent by that CA to an address such as webmaster@example.com. Once the CA received the response, the certificate would be immediately issued. Only the domain name was put into the certificate—not the organization, its address, or any other information—because the CA had access to none of that information. The organization could then set up a website for www.example.com and begin accepting credit cards securely. Consumers would see the padlock in the browser, indicating that all traffic was encrypted to/from the server via SSL/TLS. The obvious problem here was that there was not any mechanism to independently verify and validate that www.example.com was actually a legitimate business—and not someone committing fraud. In response to complaints from various parties, as well as to strengthen the authentication processes and Internet data-in-transit security, CAs and browsers formed an industry association called the “CA/Browser Forum” in 2006 to address matters such as this. Early participants of this forum included Microsoft, Symantec, Comodo, Entrust, and Mozilla. The first contribution from this industry group was specifications for the EV certificate. In this case, the CA performs enhanced vetting of the applicant to increase the level of confidence in the legitimacy of the business. The browser display is enhanced, and a user can readily discern the difference via visual indicators—usually a green lock or address bar, which indicates that the website is using an EV certificate. This makes it much easier for the consumer to know that the identity of the website has been thoroughly verified. All browsers show the organization name to the left or right of the URL. Enhanced vetting makes EV certificates much harder to obtain, in part because phishers and cyber-criminals do not want to share information about their real identities. "In a study of phishing sites using HTTPS between March 2014 and June 2015, Netcraft found that more than 77% of the SSL/TLS certificates used were domain validated (DV),” according to Robert Duncan of Netcraft. Current statistics on the certificates used by phishing sites blocked by Netcraft can be found at http://toolbar.netcraft.com/stats/certificate_authorities. Recommendations For a relatively small additional cost (compared to a DV certificate), a legitimate business conducting e- commerce could purchase an OV or EV certificate. This would prove to the consumer the business was validated by the CA and has provided address and other independently verified contact information in the certificate that the consumer could use in case of questions or problems. In addition, EV certificates provide another benefit: a visual cue (the green bar) in the browser tells the consumer the business has gone through the effort to obtain this enhanced certificate, the information has been verified by the CA, and there is a higher probability that online trust can be established.

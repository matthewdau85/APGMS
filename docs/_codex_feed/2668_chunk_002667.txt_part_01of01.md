NOTE: Qualification as a PFI Company or PFI Employee requires that the company or employee in question at all times be a PCI SSC-qualified QSA Company or QSA Employee (for Core Forensic Investigators), as applicable. Accordingly, qualification as a PFI Company or PFI Employee will immediately and automatically terminate if the underlying QSA qualification is revoked, cancelled, withdrawn or terminated.

Page 2 Interested entities must meet or exceed all applicable PFI Requirements in order to be qualified as a PFI Company or PFI Employee and maintain Good Standing as such. 1.1 Qualification Process Overview PFI Company qualification involves: (a) review of initial application materials submitted by the candidate PFI Company to determine whether the materials satisfy minimum eligibility requirements (“Document Review”), (b) follow-up information requests and interviews with key PFI Employees (collectively, “Qualification Review”), and (c) annual renewal. To initiate the PFI Company application process, the candidate PFI Company (QSA Company) must first request an application fee invoice from PCI SSC by sending an e-mail to pfi@pcisecuritystandards.org. Once paid, the candidate PFI Company will be granted access to the online application. The candidate PFI Company must fully complete and submit the online application to the Approving Organization, including all of the materials specified in the PFI Application Checklist attached hereto as Appendix A (“PFI Application Package”). Candidates that meet all applicable minimum requirements of the Document Review may participate in the Qualification Review process (described further below). Companies successful at the Qualification Review stage are then issued the initial regional invoice. Once the invoice is paid, the company is identified as a PFI Company on the list of PCI Forensic Investigators maintained on the Website (the “PFI List”) for a period of one (1) year from the date of its last PFI Program qualification (or renewal), and may renew annually thereafter, subject to PFI Program requirements and rules. Only those PFI Companies on the PFI List are recognized by PCI SSC to perform PFI Investigations. Companies not identified on the PFI List are not recognized by PCI SSC as PFI Companies.

Each outlined requirement is followed by the information that must be submitted to the Approving Organization to document that the QSA Company applying to become a PFI Company meets or exceeds the stated requirements. Information that must be submitted as part of the PFI Application Package is specified in the PFI Application Checklist attached hereto as Appendix A. All PFI Application Packages must include all of the documentation specified in the PFI Application Checklist. All remaining materials specified in the PFI Qualification Requirements but not required as part of the PFI Application Package must be provided to the Approving Organization as part of the Qualification Review process and, in any event, prior to final qualification by the Approving Organization. Note: The PFI Addendum must be executed and submitted to the Approving Organization in English, and is binding in English, even if translated and reviewed in another language. All application materials produced by the applicant (such as descriptions and references) must be submitted in English, and any application materials submitted in a language other than English (for example, business licenses and insurance certificates) must be accompanied by a certified English translation. 1.4 Additional Information Requests In an effort to maintain the integrity of the PFI Program, PCI SSC may from time to time request that PFI Companies and/or PFI Employees submit additional information or materials to the Approving Organization in order to demonstrate adherence to applicable PFI Requirements, as part of the PFI requalification process, or as part of PCI SSC’s PFI Company quality assurance process, including but not limited to in connection with remediation, revocation, or appeals. Unless otherwise agreed by the Approving Organization in a specific instance, all such additional information and materials must be submitted in accordance with the corresponding PCI SSC request, in English or with a certified English translation. PFI Companies are required to respond to each such request with the requested information and/or documentation no later than three (3) weeks from receipt of the corresponding written request or as otherwise requested by PCI SSC.

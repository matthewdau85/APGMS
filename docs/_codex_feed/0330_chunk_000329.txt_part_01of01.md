carbon black, iron oxide and resins. The formulations are specifically developed for each print engine and their properties are critical to successful MICR printing. The iron oxide used is in the form of the mineral magnetite and is capable of being magnetised by a reader/sorter write head to a suitable level to be interpreted by the magnetic read head. The mineral occurs in two crystalline forms, cubic and needle- like. The latter form is favoured for MICR toner as it retains magnetism better than the cubic form. Certain technologies however require the cubic form to be used and have had to undergo considerably more development to obtain a suitable toner. It is essential that only MICR toner, as opposed to normal toner, is used for printing E-13B characters and printing systems that are designed to detect or accept only specifically designed MICR toner containers. This avoids potential problems with the use of non-MICR toner, and those systems that do not have this feature should be treated with caution. A further desirable feature for high-volume printing is a self-monitoring print density facility that will ensure stable signal strength of the printer. 4.3.6 MICR Toner Adhesion Inserted, effective 22/03/06 Non-impact MICR printing must have toner adhesion that gives permanence (refer 2.2.11) to a level acceptable to the issuing Financial Institution and is capable of passing the Toner Adhesion Test specified in Section 1.5.2.4 of Appendix 3. 4.3.7 Storage of Paper for MICR Printing and the Effects of Moisture Inserted, effective 22/03/06 If MICR is being printed by laser printer (or other similar non-impact printing technology) then:  the moisture content of the paper will affect the level of toner adhesion and thus permanence (refer 4.3.6);  printing on paper with moisture content above 5.5% will have reduced toner adhesion, which may mean that the MICR printing does not have an acceptable level of permanence;  maximum toner adhesion and permanence is achieved when the moisture content of paper is maintained during all stages of production at MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 34 AusPayNet September 2017 4.5 – 5.5%; and  therefore, paper should be stored in a moisture proof wrapper at all times prior to MICR printing, and sufficient time allowed for conditioning of the stock if it is moved between environments prior to MICR printing. Paper will gain or lose moisture depending on the relative humidity of the air if it is not kept in a moisture proof wrapper prior to MICR printing. 4.4 Non-impact MICR Printing Technologies 4.4.1 Laser Printers Laser printers are based on the electrophotographic process developed by the Haloid Corporation (later Xerox Corporation) of Rochester, New York in the 1950s. The key component is a photoreceptor drum or belt which has a uniform electrostatic charge created on its surface by a corotron. The charge is then selectively discharged by exposing the charged photoreceptor to a light source, in this case a laser beam directed at the surface by a rotating mirror. The data is transmitted by a stream of commands that rapidly turn the laser beam on and off. The image is generated by the development sub-system in which oppositely charged toner particles are attracted to the photoreceptor. Non-imaged areas repel these particles; thus, the drum is selectively coated to create the required image. The image is transferred to paper by bringing the paper into contact with the photoreceptor. At this stage the paper is electrostatically charged in a manner that induces the toner to transfer from the photoreceptor to the paper. Passing through a heated nip roller fuses the image thus created, the nip normally being lubricated with a fine coating of silicone oil. The discharged photoreceptor requires cleaning prior to re-imaging. This is achieved by use of a cleaner corotron that loosens them from the drum surface plus a brush to remove residual toner particles. There are various arrangements of these basic components and the smaller desktop units have much simpler systems to reduce their cost. For production size machines, Xerox Corporation is the major manufacturer of laser printers and is currently producing a 600 dpi, 180 ppm printers as well as a number of smaller printers in the range 40 to 90 ppm. 4.4.2 LED Printers In this type of printer, a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) replaces the laser beam as the means for transmitting data. In most other aspects, this technology can be considered a special form of laser printing. The LED diodes are constructed as an array, known as a printbar, of very fine points that emit high-intensity light. Each diode is individually switched to control data transmission to the photoreceptor. The major proponent of LED technology is Océ Printing Systems that manufactures a range of continuous MICR printers ranging in speed from 250 to 450 ppm and have multiple resolutions of 300 and 600 dpi in the same machine. 4.4.3 Electron Beam Imaging Electron Beam Imaging, formally known as Ion Deposition, is mechanically simpler than Laser or LED printing. A rigid drum coated with a dielectric surface replaces the photoreceptor drum. The write head, is known as a print cartridge, and has a series MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 35 AusPayNet September 2017 of very small holes from which electrons are expelled towards the imaging drum. Each hole is individually controlled to create the data stream. The electrons charge the drum that then selectively

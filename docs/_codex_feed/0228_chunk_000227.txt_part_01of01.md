industry has indicated concerns with meeting the 2025 timeframe due to: The low level of maturity in token synchronicity in the Australian payments ecosystem. Noting this maturity is expected to improve over time as the eftpos eCommerce solution is implemented and adopted. Dependencies on the delivery timeframe for the eftpos eCommerce tokenisation service. The challenge associated with ensuring communication is received synchronously across all relevant tokens, noting the lack of quality metrics existing on active and inactive tokens. Potential further action: Following improvements in token synchronicity, the RBA may wish to consider addressing the current lack of quality metrics on active and inactive tokens. RBA Expectation #6: PAR (‘Payment Account Reference’) Industry agreed position: Most industry participants consider that a ubiquitous, unique, omnichannel identifier would be beneficial to enable each merchant to preserve its capability to associate all transactions, as was possible prior to tokenisation via the use of the underlying PAN. The industry requested that a technical deep dive be performed on relevant use cases to support the potential business case for PAR due to: A lack of scheme consensus on using PAR as the ubiquitous unique omnichannel identifier. The current inconsistent use and storage of PAR in the industry (addressing this inconsistency is a dependency for expanding the access to PAR). Implementation of a ubiquitous PAR requiring significant resources and time. Potential further action: AusPayNet will facilitate a technical deep dive into the use cases of PAR. Glossary DNDC or Dual Network Debit Card: a card for which transactions may be routed through two distinct card schemes. In Australia, DNDCs are associated with eftpos, and one of the international schemes (Visa, Mastercard or UnionPay (for Bank of China cards only)). Gateway Token (also known as a PCI Token, Proprietary Token or Merchant Token): a token issued against the original sensitive data for use by online payment ecosystem participants within their own internal environment, and not the entire payment ecosystem. Network Token (also known as a Scheme Token or Payment Token): a token issued by the payment networks/schemes to replace the PAN and other sensitive details for use across the entire payment ecosystem. Network tokens are specific to domains (i.e. limited to one device, merchant, channel or transaction type) and prevent the need for a PAN to be transmitted or revealed to any party during a transaction. Network tokens are issued by PSPs registered with EMVCo and the use of Network tokens is covered by the EMVCo Technical Framework. PAN or Primary Account Number: the 16–19-digit number associated with a payment account. These numbers are often referred to as either the funding PANs (‘FPAN’) (the physical number on the card itself) or the Token PAN/Device PAN (‘TPAN’/’DPAN’) for the equivalent numbers of the tokenised version of the FPAN. References to PANs in this report refer to the FPANs of DNDCs. PAR or Payment Account Reference: an alphanumeric data point which acts as a proxy for the FPAN in any card or token-based transaction. The same PAR is expected to be present for any transaction generated from an FPAN or any tokenised form of that PAN and is used to associate transactions across different payment form factors. TIWG or Tokenisation Industry Working Group: the industry working group established by AusPayNet to support AusPayNet’s coordination of an industry response to meeting the Expectations, including the development of standards that may be required. Token: a unique identifier that replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive, randomised data that has no essential or exploitable value or meaning. The token can only be reversed to the original data (de-tokenised) by the tokenisation system that created the token.

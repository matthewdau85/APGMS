Principles of Document Design 1.1 Cheques and Deposit Forms Amended, effective 19/05/08 Design specifications have been established which have resulted in cheques, deposit forms and other payment forms, hereinafter referred to as documents, being suited for both manual and electronic processing. These specifications have been revised to incorporate the requirements of improvements to these systems, which can now "read" the amount in both handwritten and machine printed numerics. Documents have been divided into a number of areas that provide for the insertion of information. Except where specifically stated, dimensions of areas are dependent on the amount of information to be entered, whether by handwriting, typewriter or other printers. Documents should be designed so that anyone, by a glance rather than by close scrutiny, can readily recognise the correct dollar amount. To comply with this principle the MANDATORY position for the amount in figures is at the right-hand side of the document. All other information must be kept well away from the amount in figures. Information must not appear to the right of the amount in figures. The document design must also enable the name of the Financial Institution on which the cheque is drawn to be determined at a glance. The Financial Institution name must be in the upper portion of the form. The design should also be such that the signature of the drawer and the printed name of the account can be readily located. The printed name of the account should be adjacent to the signature. The area reserved for signature(s) must be free of other printing which could interfere with legibility and placed to keep signatures from encroaching into areas reserved for the amount in figures and magnetic ink encoding. Draft layout of forms must be submitted to the Financial Institution concerned for design approval before proceeding with

this type of assessment depends on the TPSP’s willingness to provide the necessary information. Depending on the legal agreements between the parties, there may be many instances where the TPSP declines to provide proprietary and confidential information. As detailed in “Gain Transparency,” the entity may wish to request that the TPSP document its refusal to provide the information in writing, if appropriate. 4.7 Frequency of Review The following table shows the suggested frequency of review for the engagement steps: Engaging Third-party Service Providers Steps Initially As Changes Occur* Annually  Set Expectations X X X  Gain Transparency X X X  Establish Communications X X X  Request Evidence X X X  Obtain Information about PCI DSS Compliance X X The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 19 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 * Note: Depending on the type of change introduced, this step may or may not be required. For example, a significant infrastructure change may initiate all steps, whereas a change that does not impact the CDE or PCI DSS compliance—for example, changes in primary point of contact—may only trigger a few steps. The result of risk assessments performed during the due diligence process will help determine how often these steps need to be repeated. 4.8 Mapping of Third-Party Services to Applicable PCI DSS Requirements It is critical that the entity fully understands how the services and products provided by the TPSP map to the PCI DSS requirements, so the entity can determine the security impact to its cardholder data environment. The requirements that are applicable to a TPSP will vary depending on a number of factors, including the nature of services provided, the level of access it has to CDE, and so on. For example, a TPSP that provides firewall management services may have to meet PCI DSS Requirement 18; a TPSP providing maintenance services that include incidental access to the CDE may require background checks and/or escorts while in sensitive areas. Appendix A to this document provides a table showing suggestions and discussion points that may help clarify and determine how responsibilities for maintaining PCI DSS requirements may be shared between the entity and the TPSP. Appendix B is a sample PCI DSS Responsibility Matrix to help an entity start building an understanding of how PCI DSS requirements could map to the services that an entity outsources to a TPSP and the related accountability for each. 8 This reference is to PCI DSS v3.1 – April 2015 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 20 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 5 Written Agreements, Policies, and Procedures Note: The information and guidance provided in this section and generally throughout this Information Supplement do not constitute legal advice and, accordingly, should not be relied upon or construed as such. Entities seeking to engage a TPSP to perform services are strongly encouraged to seek legal advice from an appropriately qualified professional to ensure that each party fully understands its rights and obligations, and that the parties’ expectations are in alignment. Entities with specific questions about legal matters should consult an appropriately qualified legal professional. The information and guidance provided in this section do not supersede local or regional laws, government regulations, or other legal requirements. Ultimately, the specific terms of the agreement between an entity and a TPSP should reflect all of the details of the services being provided and the relevant rights and responsibilities of both parties. Once an appropriate risk-assessment process has been completed and a TPSP has been selected for an engagement, best practice suggests that the entity and TPSP should document their agreement in writing. The discussion below is intended to highlight certain issues specific to a typical entity–TPSP relationship that an entity may want to consider when seeking to engage a TPSP. Entities with existing agreements with TPSPs may also wish to consider the following when reviewing those agreements. The following is not intended to be an exhaustive list and is provided as a convenience in order to help familiarize entities seeking TPSP engagements with the kinds of issues that commonly arise in this context. Other issues may arise and may be equally or more important, and entities are strongly encouraged to seek appropriately qualified legal counsel in connection with all business agreements. 5.1 Agreements between PCI DSS Compliant Third-Party Service Providers versus non-PCI DSS Compliant Third-Party Service Providers TPSPs that have undergone PCI DSS compliance assessment and are validated as compliant: When engaging a TPSP that claims its services are PCI DSS compliant, entities should consider documenting such compliance. The specific documentation that may be provided will ultimately depend on the situation and agreement between the parties, and may include provision of an AOC, SAQ, and/or relevant sections from the ROC (redacted to protect any confidential information), including:  Date of compliance assessment  System components, services, and environments that were included in the third-party PCI DSS assessment  System components and services that were excluded from the PCI DSS assessment, as applicable to the service(s) provided Having the TPSP resources available (including ISA or QSA if required) to answer any clarification questions may be useful in validating that the services

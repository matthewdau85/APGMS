In July 2024, we responded to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement’s inquiry into the capability of law enforcement to respond to cybercrime. Given AusPayNet’s remit and expertise, our submission focused on the key challenges and opportunities for law enforcement in countering cyber-enabled economic crime, particularly online scams, fraud, and money laundering, including: The importance of cross-agency coordination and public-private partnerships (such as AusPayNet’s Economic Crime Forum) in enhancing law enforcement's ability to detect and respond to cybercrime. We encouraged the Government to continue prioritising the removal of any barriers to appropriate information sharing arrangements, which are critical to providing law enforcement with quality intelligence leads across all areas of cyber-enabled crime. The need for international collaboration to support law enforcement’s ability to effectively investigate and respond to cybercrime, since many criminal syndicates are located offshore. Ongoing challenges related to the quality and availability of cybercrime intelligence, and the potential to significantly improve law enforcement's ability to identify and respond to cybercrime by addressing the current fragmentation of reporting channels, and improving the effectiveness of reporting processes. The role of the financial sector in intercepting and recouping proceeds of cybercrime, including through initiatives such as the AFCX Fraud Reporting Exchange. AusPayNet’s submission is available below.

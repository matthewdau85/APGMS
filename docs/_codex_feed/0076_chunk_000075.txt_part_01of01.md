structure, and a related communications plan will be developed. More detail on this plan will be available by the end of the year. top Cross-border payments update Since delivering its Priorities for the next phase of work , the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has published its Priority actions for achieving the G20 targets . This articulates specific action items across the themes of: Payment system interoperability and extension Legal, regulatory and supervisory frameworks Cross-border data exchange and message standards. In support of these themes, two taskforces have been established: The Committee on Payment and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) has established the Payment System Interoperability and Extension (PIE) Taskforce to bring together the public and private sectors to provide advice and coordination, and to plan implementation measures to improve market conventions and practices. The FSB has established the Legal, Regulatory and Supervisory (LRS) Taskforce, which brings together public and private sector experts to provide feedback and input on reducing the frictions from data, legal, regulatory or supervisory frameworks that impact cross-border payments. In addition, an API Panel of Experts is being established to evaluate proposals for API standards in cross-border payment information exchange, to develop recommendations for greater harmonisation of APIs, and to develop a longer-term global governance proposal and process. Australia has representation on both the PIE and LRS Taskforces and we look forward to working with our global peers to reduce the frictions experienced in cross-border payments. These actions – identified by the FSB, CPMI and their partner organisations – in conjunction with the Taskforces, will be foundational in helping deliver the quantitative targets of faster, cheaper, accessible and transparent cross-border payments. In April, we published the most recent issue of our Cross-Border Payments Round-Up , which provides a summary of the FSB’s activities, responses to consultations and other actions being undertaken to support and successfully implement the roadmap and domestic cross-border payment priorities. The next bi-yearly issue of the Cross-Border Payments Round-Up will be published in October. top Blog posts AusPayNet regularly publishes blog posts, sharing important information and insights regarding Australia’s payments system.

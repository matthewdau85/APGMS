TPSP. This guidance focuses primarily on the following: Third-Party Service Provider Due Diligence: Thorough vetting of candidates through careful due diligence, prior to establishing a relationship, assists entities in reviewing and selecting TPSPs with skills and experience appropriate for the engagement. Service Correlation to PCI DSS Requirements: Understanding how the services provided by TPSPs correspond to the applicable PCI DSS requirements assists the entity in determining the potential security impact of utilizing TPSPs on the entity’s cardholder data environment. This information can also be used to determine and understand which of the PCI DSS requirements will apply to and be satisfied by the TPSP, and which will apply to and be met by the entity. Note: Ultimate responsibility for compliance resides with the entity, regardless of how specific responsibilities may be allocated between an entity and its TPSP(s). Written Agreements and Policies and Procedures: Detailed written agreements promote consistency and mutual understanding between the organization and its TPSP(s) concerning their respective responsibilities and obligations with respect to PCI DSS compliance requirements. Monitor Third-Party Service Provider Compliance Status: Knowing the TPSP’s PCI DSS compliance status helps to provide the organization engaging a TPSP with assurance and awareness about whether the TPSP complies with the applicable requirements for the services provided. If the TPSP offers a variety of services, this knowledge will assist the entity in determining which TPSP services will be in scope for the entity’s PCI DSS assessment. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 2 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 1.1 Intended Use The intent of this information supplement is to provide guidance to entities engaging TPSPs with whom CHD is shared or that could impact the security of CHD, as required by PCI DSS Requirement 12.81. This additional guidance for PCI DSS Requirement 12.81 is intended to assist entities and TPSPs better understand their respective roles in meeting this requirement. The information in this document is intended as supplemental guidance and does not supersede, replace, or extend PCI DSS requirements. Ultimately, the entity is responsible for ensuring its own PCI DSS compliance, whether or not a TPSP is involved. How responsibilities are allocated between an entity and its TPSP(s) often depends on the specific relationship and services being provided. This guidance does not replace proper risk assessment, and compliance with the guidance does not guarantee compliance with Requirement 12.81, etc. 1.2 Terminology The following terms are used throughout this document:  Entity – An entity is any organization that has the responsibility to protect card data and may leverage a third-party service provider to support them in card-processing activities or to secure card data.  TPSP (Third-party Service Provider) – As defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms, a service provider is a business entity that is not a payment brand, directly involved in the processing, storage, or transmission of cardholder data on behalf of another entity. This also includes companies that provide services that control or could impact the security of cardholder data. There are many types of businesses that could fall into the category of “service provider,” dependent on the services provided. Most commonly, a TPSP could be a legally separate entity; but it can also be a separate business unit or component of the entity under assessment—for example, an internal service provider—where the provider is outside the direct management control of the entity assessed.  Nested or Chained TPSP – A nested or chained TPSP is any entity that is contracted for its services by another third-party service provider for the purposes of providing a service. 1.3 Audience Entities Engaging a Third-Party Service Provider (for example, issuers, merchants, acquirers, or other service providers) – Entities that engage TPSPs for the storage, transmission, processing of cardholder data, or otherwise provision of services that control or may impact the security of cardholder data may benefit from these guidelines. The recommendations provided in this document are intended to assist entities in developing an increased understanding regarding utilization of TPSPs and the subsequent impact to the entity’s cardholder data environment, the impact to the entity’s own PCI DSS compliance responsibilities, as well as provide guidance on how to meet the intent of PCI DSS Requirement 12.81 governing TPSPs. 1 This reference is to PCI DSS v3.1 – April 2015 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 3 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 Third-Party Service Providers – This guidance document may also provide useful information for TPSPs in understanding the responsibilities of TPSPs to the entities for which the TPSPs are providing services. In addition, a TPSP may be dependent on the compliance of a nested or chained TPSP to achieve overall compliance of a service. The TPSP should understand how best to engage with its partner(s) to ensure PCI DSS compliance of the services being offered. PCI DSS Requirement 12.92 also requires service providers to acknowledge in writing to the TPSP’s customers its responsibilities for securing the customers’ cardholder data or the customers’ cardholder data environment. Acquirers (also known as “acquiring banks,” “merchant banks,” or “acquiring financial institutions”) – As an entity that initiates and maintains relationships with merchants for the acceptance of

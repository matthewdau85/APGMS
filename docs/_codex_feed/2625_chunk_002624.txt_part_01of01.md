“Detect and Respond to Security Control Failures,” for further information.) 8. Maintain Security Awareness – Social engineering techniques are often leading to data breaches and exfiltration of critical data. Organizations should implement a formal security awareness process with content that is kept up to date with the latest trends in breaches. (See 3.8, “Maintain Security Awareness,” for further information.) 9. Monitoring Compliance of Third-Party Service Providers – Often, organizations will rely on third-party service providers to implement and maintain security controls required to meet PCI DSS. Organizations should develop and implement processes to monitor the compliance status of its service providers to determine whether a change in status requires a change in the relationship. (See 3.9, “Monitoring Compliance of Third-Party Service Providers," for further information.) 10. Evolve the Compliance Program to Address Changes – Organizations should evolve their controls with the threat landscape, changes in organizational structure, new business initiatives, and changes in business processes and technologies to ensure these do not negatively impact the organization’s security posture. (See 3.10 “Evolve the Compliance Program to Address Changes,” for further information.)

Organizations that focus solely on annual PCI DSS assessments to validate the quality of their cardholder data security programs are missing the intent of PCI DSS to enhance cardholder data security, and likely see their PCI DSS compliance state “fall off” between assessments (see Figure 1). In order to maintain a consistent level of security and compliance, organizations should have a well- designed program of security controls and monitoring practices in place to ensure that the intent of PCI DSS is being met at all times.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 8 Too often organizations rely on the annual assessment and fail to establish effective long-term processes for maintaining the security of cardholder data. The ongoing security of cardholder data should be the driving objective behind all PCI DSS compliance activities—not simply attaining a compliant Report on Compliance (ROC). To ensure the continued viability of the entire payment ecosystem, all payment-industry stakeholders should remember that they must be good stewards of cardholder data if consumers are going to retain trust in using payment cards. The next section offers a series of best practices that can help organizations maintain a more consistent state of security and compliance, avoid compliance fall-off, and protect themselves and their customers from the loss or improper disclosure of cardholder data.

This includes everyone in the payment chain⎯merchants, service providers, acquirers, issuers, the payment brands, and consumers⎯from damages resulting from the theft or improper disclosure of cardholder data. Cardholder data remains one of the easiest types of data to convert to cash and represents nearly three-quarters of all attacks on retail, hospitality, and food-service companies.5 It is recommended to store cardholder data and other consumer information only when necessary. Any cardholder data not deemed critical to business functions should be removed from the environment in accordance with the organization’s data-retention policies. This helps reduce the complexity and costs associated with protecting this data. In addition, organizations should evaluate business and operating procedures for alternatives to retaining cardholder data. 3.2 Develop Program, Policy, and Procedures A compliance program is a formalized set of policies, processes, and procedures with assigned accountability within an organization intended to ensure the organization's sustainable compliance with applicable and necessary standards and requirements. A formal compliance program allows an organization to monitor the health of its security controls, be proactive in the event that a control fails, and effectively communicate activities and compliance status throughout the organization. When designing a compliance program, it is important to understand the differences between these terms and concepts: ▪ A program typically includes strategic

include: NIST Special Publication 800-57 Part 1, BSI TR-02102-1, ECRYPT-CSA D5.4 Algorithms, Key Size and Protocols Report (2018), and ISO/IEC 18033 Encryption algorithms, and ISO/IEC 14888-3:2-81 IT Security techniques – Digital signatures with appendix – Part 3: Discrete logarithm based mechanisms . System Components Any network devices, servers, computing devices, virtual components, or software included in or connected to the CDE, or that could impact the security of cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data. System-level object Anything on a system component that is required for its operation, including but not limited to application executables and configuration files, system configuration files, static and shared libraries and DLLs, system executables, device drivers and device configuration files, and third-party components. t TAB Acronym for “Technical Advisory Board.” Targeted Risk Analysis For PCI DSS purposes, a risk analysis that focuses on a specific PCI DSS requirement(s) of interest, either because the requirement allows flexibility (for example, as to frequency) or, for the Customized Approach, to explain how the entity assessed the risk and determined the customized control meets the objective of a PCI DSS requirement. TDES Acronym for “Triple Data Encryption Standard.” Also referred to as “3DES” or “Triple DES.” TELNET Abbreviation for “telephone network protocol.” TGG Acronym for “Technology Guidance Group.” Third-Party Service Provider (TPSP) Any third party acting as a service provider on behalf of an entity. See Multi-Tenant Service Provider and Service Provider. Third-Party Software Software that is acquired by, but not developed expressly for, an entity. It may be open source, freeware, shareware, or purchased. TLS Acronym for “Transport Layer Security.” Token In the context of authentication and access control, a token is a value provided by hardware or software that works with an authentication server or VPN to perform dynamic or multi-factor authentication. Track Data Also referred to as “full track data” or “magnetic-stripe data.” Data encoded in the magnetic stripe or chip used for authentication and/or authorization during payment transactions. Can be the magnetic-stripe image on a chip or the track data on the magnetic stripe. Truncation Method of rendering a full PAN unreadable by removing a segment of PAN data. Truncation relates to protection of PAN when electronically stored, processed, or transmitted. See Masking for protection of PAN when displayed on screens, paper receipts, etc. Trusted Network Network of an entity that is within the entity’s ability to control or manage and that meets applicable PCI DSS requirements. v Virtual Payment Terminal In the context of Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) C-VT, a virtual payment terminal is web-browser-based access to an acquirer, processor, or third-party service provider website to authorize payment card transactions, where the merchant manually enters payment card data through a web browser. Unlike physical terminals, virtual payment terminals do not read data directly from a payment card. Because payment card transactions are entered manually, virtual payment terminals are typically used instead of physical terminals in merchant environments with low transaction volumes. Virtualization The logical abstraction of computing resources from physical and/or logical constraints. One common abstraction is referred to as virtual machines or VMs, which takes the content of a physical machine and allows it to operate on different physical hardware and/or along with other virtual machines on the same physical hardware. Other common abstractions include, but are not limited to, containers, serverless computing, or microservices. Visitor A vendor, guest of any personnel, service worker, or personnel that normally do not have access to the subject area. Cardholders present in a retail location to purchase goods or services are not considered “visitors.” See Cardholder and Personnel. VPN Acronym for “virtual private network.” Vulnerability Flaw or weakness which, if exploited, may result in an intentional or unintentional compromise of a system.

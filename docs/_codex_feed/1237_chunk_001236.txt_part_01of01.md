Activity Statement 2023 service remediation working group – 19 September 2024 Original Published Date 19/09/2024 - 9:10am Tax Category Payroll Tax preparation Business accounting Description The Activity Statement 2023 service remediation working group is an ATO initiative that will engage with industry representatives to explore pathways to remediate for the activity statement 2023 service to ensure we have a fit for purpose service for DSPs. This meeting was held online on Thursday 19 September 2024 . Key outcomes Summary Below is a summary of the key outcomes. Note: the full outcomes are available on the DSP hub. Timeline A timeline for AS2025 GET, Validate, and Submit was shared to gauge DSP interest in EVTE testing, starting March 2025. The AS2009 service will be deprecated 18 months after the new service release. Pseudo tuple review and discussion There is no clear direction for Pseudo Tuple for Activity Statements. Further consultation is needed with the PLS Working Group and DSP Architecture Reference Group. MST review A draft MST overview was presented with updates to align it with AS2009, remove redundant fields, and revise labels/tuples. Two consultation questions were raised about error information and attribute supply in GET vs. Validate/Submit interactions. Next steps The next working group meeting will be held on 31 October 2024 . For any questions or feedback, contact the secretariat by email at DPO@ato.gov.au or lodge a ticket in DSP service desk .

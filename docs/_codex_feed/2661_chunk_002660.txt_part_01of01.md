United States The Federal Trade Commission is the principal agency that enforces U.S. privacy policy. In addition, individual state law can require further considerations.  Equality Act, United Kingdom Legislation in the United Kingdom involving accessibility makes it illegal to discriminate against people with disabilities when providing a service in the public, private, and voluntary sectors. As a result, organizations can have a legal obligation to provide services to individuals with accessibility needs. Some technologies introduced for payment security may exclude these individuals, and alternative mechanisms may need to be considered when implementing such technologies. The relevance and applicability of non-financial legislation and regulations may depend on the industry, environment, jurisdiction, and other matters. Accordingly, guidance should be requested from appropriate legal representatives before making decisions. Information Supplement • PCI DSS for Large Organizations • February 2020 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard or constitute legal advice. 28 10.2 Additional Standards and Frameworks While other security standards can provide robust security approaches, they are not exchangeable with PCI DSS because they are designed for different audiences and uses. PCI DSS is the only standard specific to the payment card industry; however, these additional industry standards can complement PCI DSS and assist with payment security. Many security standards and frameworks are universally applicable, and large organizations can benefit from the guidance they provide when it comes to protecting data and sensitive assets. These standards can offer significant benefits to large organizations by helping to deploy frameworks that can provide constant baselines across organizations. Standards and frameworks provide consistency in interpreting security needs across organizations, which can be advantageous with globally distributed business units that have diverse cultures and operating practices. Without this standardization, there is a risk that business units, each with varying responsibilities, interpret security requirements differently, causing errors and unforeseen compliance lapses. Additionally, security standards and frameworks can support the communication of core security concepts in common terms and language. This can be especially useful for staff who are not experienced in payment security, thereby improving the overall security culture of the organization. Some common standards and frameworks that can support PCI DSS include:  Control Objectives for Information Technology (COBIT)  Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)  International Organization of Standardization (ISO)  Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)  NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Many large organizations have existing security standards incorporated into their environments. Using these standards can save significant time and resources by building on existing security controls. For example, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) share the common goal of enhancing data security. While the NIST Framework identifies general security outcomes and activities, PCI DSS provides specific direction and guidance on how to meet security outcomes for payment environments. A tool for mapping PCI DSS to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is available on the PCI SSC website to help organizations understand how to align security efforts to meet objectives in both PCI DSS and the NIST Framework. The "Mapping PCI DSS v3.2.1 to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework v1.1" can be downloaded from the PCI Council's Document Library on the PCI SSC website: https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library Information Supplement • PCI DSS for Large Organizations • February 2020 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

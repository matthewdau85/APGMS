therefore include consideration for all distributed and regional business units. Obtaining the most recent Report(s) on Compliance (ROC) and Attestation of Compliance (AOC) for business units being acquired is critical in determining the security state of the payment channels for these business units. As merger and acquisition timelines may extend over multiple PCI DSS assessment periods, an organization should ensure it has the most recent reports and AOCs as soon as they are available. 5.2 Existing Compliance and Integration To prioritize controls, it is important to determine whether an organization was compliant from the start or met PCI DSS compliance controls at one time and then failed to maintain those controls. Some organizations may not be evidentially compliant with PCI DSS, and their compliance state is not actively being pursued by the acquirer or its agent. A lack of knowledge of PCI DSS can cause an organization to misrepresent its compliance to its acquirer. Additionally, the documentation supplied by an organization being purchased or undergoing a merger may not have been developed to meet requirements specified in PCI DSS. This can lead to unreliable statements of compliance, which may not accurately reflect potential liabilities of the purchased organization.

Appropriate time is required for migrating these payment processes into existing payment channels. Consolidation can be a multi-year project, and organizations need to consider the integration of business processes that may change reporting requirements. It is also important to recognize that these concerns can flow in the opposite direction. If a business unit within a larger organization is sold, for example, this may leave the parent organization accountable as a service provider until the organization can establish its payment card security operations and associated agreements. Following an acquisition, the buying organization should put in place a program to understand changes in PCI DSS scope and identify gaps in security controls within the newly acquired business. After all required information is collected, a comprehensive migration strategy should be developed that includes input from subject-matter experts for all relevant disciplines and business units. Increased demands on resources can occur prior to full organization consolidation due to different working methods, rendering the budget for creating and maintaining a PCI DSS-compliant organization inadequate. Additionally, the acquisition of an organization can change the volume of transactions significantly. Mergers and acquisitions can also have a significant impact on the planning and completion of PCI DSS assessments. Following a merger or acquisition, entities and their assessors should take extra care to ensure they are aware of all the relevant business units and payment channels that are in scope for PCI DSS or could affect PCI DSS processes. This includes identifying all new and existing Merchant Identification Numbers (MIDs) and the associated acquirer relationships, so that the compliance reporting requirements for all new lines of business can be addressed. Business identities of large organizations could take several years to fully merge. During this time, a team should be identified to safeguard the protection of environments (e.g., merchant identities, technologies, and other processes) until there is confidence that all appropriate PCI DSS controls can be met.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard or constitute legal advice. 15 6 Multiple Acquirers and Payment Channels Large organizations often have multiple payment channels—for example, card-present channels, e- commerce websites, and call centers. The complexity associated with managing multiple channels can be compounded when the organization or its business units are required to validate compliance with multiple acquirers or payment brands. Depending on the compliance program, each acquirer could ask the organization or business unit for different information to demonstrate the unit’s compliance obligations. For example, one acquirer could require an organization to complete the Designated Entities Supplemental Validation (DESV), and another acquirer may require only PCI DSS. 6.1 Acquirer Relationships Assigning ownership and responsibility for maintaining acquirer relationships is important when managing compliance requirements successfully for multiple payment channels. Identifying a single point of contact and designating a team to manage all relationships with acquirers and payment service providers (PSP) can help align compliance efforts. This team should be responsible for understanding the acquirer’s requirements and, where possible, have representatives from a cross section of departments within the organization. 6.2 Compliance Agreements and Expectations When establishing agreements, the following inclusions can help to develop a common understanding and expectation for PCI DSS compliance responsibilities:  Clearly stating and defining an organization’s payment channels that are associated with the acquirer.  Providing details of the contractual commitment from the PSP that demonstrates its commitment to maintaining the appropriate security of cardholder data that it obtains from the organization.  Maintaining a written agreement that includes an acknowledgment that service providers are responsible for protecting the cardholder data they possess or otherwise store, process, or transmit on behalf of the customer, or to the extent that they could impact the security of the customer’s cardholder data environment.

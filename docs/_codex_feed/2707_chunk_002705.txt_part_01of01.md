service provider for that service. This means that a carrier providing only ISDN lines and SIP trunks, with no additional services, may not have any PCI DSS responsibilities. In this scenario, the entity or service provider would consider the carrier network a public or untrusted network, and applicable PCI DSS controls would need to be in place to protect account data transmitted over such networks. Carriers or other entities providing services such as call center services, call-recording technologies, call-recording storage, hosting of call-recording technologies, or other functionality that impacts account data would be considered service providers for PCI DSS purposes. When looking at a telecommunication company’s services, organizations should have a clear understanding of the details of the services being provided—including where scope begins and ends and the demarcation points of those services. For example, two telecommunications companies might provide what appears to be the same service (telephone connectivity), with one doing so over the Internet and the other through a private network. The controls required to protect data sent over these connections will be different for each service. If an entity is using multiple service providers, a detailed understanding of responsibilities for each provider and the entity itself is critical to ensure there are no gaps in the protection of payment card data. The entity should also understand how the different services interconnect and the methods and tools used to manage the interconnections. The use of a third-party service provider does not relieve the entity of ultimate responsibility for its own PCI DSS compliance, nor does it exempt the entity from accountability and obligation for ensuring that its payment card data and CDE are secure. The entity must manage the relationship with the service provider as per PCI DSS Requirement 12.8, including listing of service providers, maintaining agreements and acknowledgement of responsibilities, carrying out due diligence prior to engagement, and monitoring the service provider’s PCI DSS compliance status. For more information on this topic, it is recommended to review the Information Supplement, Third-Party Security Assurance, published by the PCI SSC. Information Supplement • Protecting Telephone-Based Payment Card Data • November 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 43 7.2 Common Telephony-related Services This section explores some of the services commonly provided to telephone environments, along with considerations for scoping and implementation of security controls. Most of the following services can also be hosted in house. 7.2.1 Private Branch Exchange (PBX) Services PBX is a telephone system that switches calls within an organization. With the growth of VoIP, many organizations are looking for PBX services that can be routed via IP over private or public data networks from the service provider to the organization. Payments accepted over these PBX services are in scope for applicable PCI DSS requirements. 7.2.2 SIP Trunking SIP trunks replace classic ISDN and T1 lines, providing connectivity between an organization’s PBX systems and the service provider’s SBC. SIP Trunks can connect directly to end-user devices within the organization or, alternatively, an organization’s internal calls can be routed by the SIP trunk provider through a virtual hosted PBX service. As the technology matures, technical boundaries between an organization and a SIP-trunk provider may become harder to define. Scoping for these services will therefore require an understanding of how connections are made between the different entities. 7.2.3 Interactive Voice Response (IVR) IVR technologies are used for interactions between human callers and computers and can use both voice (incorporating speech recognition) and DTMF tones to collect information from the customer in an automated process. Entities may choose to outsource their payment processing to an IVR solution provider to reduce or remove the presence of account data in the entity’s environment. 7.2.4 Fraud Detection/Monitoring The evolution of telephony technologies also supports development of fraud-detection and monitoring capabilities in telephone environments. For example, data captured from SIP headers and RTP media streams may provide useful input to a fraud-analysis and decision-making process. If any account data (PAN or SAD) is included in such an analysis, PCI DSS requirements will apply to that process. 7.2.5 Voice Analytics Voice, or speech, analytics use specialized speech-recognition techniques to analyze and extract information from spoken data and are typically used to monitor agent quality and improve customer management. Modern solutions can analyze call data in real-time or be combined with transcription and storage services to perform detailed data mining of call transcripts or audio recordings. As these tools are designed to categorize and locate specific types of data, their use in environments where account data is present needs to be carefully controlled and monitored.

Diagram 11 below represents a number of entities that outsource call recording using the same Level 1 Service Provider. Note: Storing SAD after authorization is not allowedrefer to Appendix D, “Call Recording Decision-making Process.” Diagram 11: Outsourced call recording The data from the entities may be merged at the level of the service provider and the cloud storage provider.

and detect fraud. Training should include how to inspect POS devices for tampering at the beginning of each shift, checking devices are physically secured, and looking for suspicious activity in areas where the public has access to payment terminals. Additionally, having store cashiers trained to detect equipment failure and unusual events can ensure the security of cardholder data is maintained. For example, staff trained in fallback procedures will know that a terminal falls back to magnetic stripe if a chip cannot be read, and that manual key entry should only occur if the magnetic stripe cannot be read. IT Administrators System, database, network administrators, and other staff with privileged access to computer systems will require more detailed security awareness training that includes understanding the importance of secure system configurations for the protection of sensitive information. In addition to the general security awareness training, further training may be necessary to address the different methods by which the role handles cardholder data. It may also be beneficial for administrators to understand how the organization receives and processes payments, so they can better understand the implications of their actions. For specialized functions and service, vendor-provided recommendations and industry best-practice guides for secure configurations can be useful content to include in training. For example, the Centre for Internet Security (CIS) provides security benchmarks and recommended configurations for a variety of systems.

Very often, these teams receive minimal security training or are not aware of how their role fits into the larger picture of the organization’s compliance or security posture. A well-developed software security program that facilitates the organization’s PCI DSS compliance will incorporate not only secure coding training but will ensure that such training deals specifically with the particulars of the languages, frameworks, and toolsets used by the development team. Training will also tie closely into the development process, where issues are uncovered by code reviews, quality-assurance checks, penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, or by outside parties such as QSA feedback into the training materials. Furthermore, training directives for using functions properly or performing adequate review and testing should yield modifications to the development process. Events such as changes in software used, security incidents, major findings from security assessments, or the like should prompt updates to the training materials and support the need for regular interaction with the development team. 8.3 Developing Training Materials After PCI DSS knowledge areas are mapped to roles, training materials can be developed to meet the needs of these roles. Training can be delivered in a number of ways, including:  Reviewing policy or procedure  Live or video demonstrations  Hands-on workshops  E-learning courses When defining training goals, the purpose, audience, method of delivery, and method of tracking completion and effectiveness should be considered. For example, the expectations of cashiers and other customer-facing staff will be significantly different than the expectations of a database administrator or security operations staff. It can be advantageous to work with individuals across the organization that are aware of local environment conditions. Considering laws, customs, and cultural and political differences, and then adapting to these nuances, can assist with the adoption and effectiveness of training material. Training should cover PCI DSS topics relevant to the audience, and include definitions for any organizational and PCI terminology. Whereas training can focus on the functional aspects of security controls, providing context for the importance of PCI DSS training, including the potential impact of non-compliance to the organization, can be a powerful mechanism for collaboration. Training should condense and simplify PCI DSS topics to cover what the audience needs to know, as well as include definitions for any organizational and PCI jargon. Global compliance training material can be beneficial for providing a baseline on compliance training and security controls for functions that share similarities and common audiences. Defining the roles and PCI DSS knowledge required are central first steps to determining the content of training material. This can then lead to the development and adoption of modular training formats, with material that can be mixed and matched for tailored training where knowledge areas and roles overlap. 8.4 Delivering Training When awareness training is delivered live from a central location, multiple sessions should be scheduled at different times to support teams across different time zones. Organizations could also consider using dedicated local resources or third-party translations services to support regional training needs.

Expanding on one or more of the topics in greater detail for each of the training sessions can differentiate the content, so that it does not become repetitive for staff. Incorporating training activities into existing activities, such as team meetings or safety training, can streamline training efforts. E-learning tools can provide an option for learners to take training at any time,

requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 12 ▪ Provider 1 relies on Provider 2 for web content delivery services and Provider 3 for media streaming, as well as Provider 1.5 (internal/private cloud) for PaaS. ▪ Provider 4 provides SaaS service to both Providers 2 and 3. ▪ Provider 5 provides IaaS service to Provider 3. There may be multiple layers or levels of Provider dependency, which can affect the security of the cardholder environment. Identifying all third-party relationships that the Provider has in place is important in order to understand the potential ramifications for a Customer’s environment. The existence of multiple nested relationshipsfor example, where there is a chain of vendors and other Providers required for delivery of a cloud servicewill also add complexity to both the Provider’s and the Customer’s PCI DSS assessment process. Where the Customer has a direct contractual relationship with all nested Providers, the Customer will need to understand the impact each Provider has on its CDE, and how PCI DSS responsibilities are managed for each service. Where the Customer does not have contractual relationships with all nested Providers, the Customer would rely on the primary Provider (that is, the Provider with which the Customer has a direct relationship, and which, in turn, manages relationships with the nested Providers) to manage the relationships and PCI DSS responsibilities for all Providers involved in delivery of the service. In both cases, it can be helpful to communicate these relationships to the Customer (consider using the optional PCI DSS Responsibility Matrix), so that it can understand PCI DSS compliance considerations for all components of the service. Moreover, Customers may also leverage this nested Provider relationship information for pre-engagement due diligence (Requirement 12.8) as well as the following processes: ▪ Risk profiling and management ▪ Business continuity and disaster recovery planning ▪ Threat monitoring ▪ Supply-chain management Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

For example, PCI DSS Requirements 6.1 and 6.2 address the need for vulnerabilities to be identified and ranked according to risk, and for missing patches to be deployed in a timely manner. If not properly defined, a Customer could assume that the Provider is managing this process for the entire cloud environment, whereas the Provider could be managing vulnerabilities for its underlying infrastructure only, and assuming that the Customer is managing vulnerabilities for operating systems and applications. 4.2 PCI DSS Responsibilities for Different Cloud Service Categories As a general rule, the more aspects of a Customer’s operations that the Provider manages, the more responsibility the Provider has for maintaining PCI DSS controls. However, outsourcing maintenance of controls is not the same as outsourcing responsibility for the data overall. Customers should not make assumptions about any service, and should clearly spell out in contracts, memorandums of understanding or SLAs exactly which party is responsible for securing which system components and processes. Table 2 provides an example of how responsibilities for PCI DSS requirements may be shared between Customers and Providers across some of the various cloud service categories. There will of course be exceptions and variations across each individual service, and this table is provided as a guideline for Customers and Providers to help plan discussions and negotiations. Responsibilities have been identified as follows: ▪ Customer – Generally, each Customer will retain responsibility for maintaining and verifying the requirement. ▪ Provider – Generally, the Provider will maintain and verify the requirement for its Customers. ▪ Shared – Generally, responsibility is shared between the Customer and the Provider. This may be due to the requirement applying to elements present in both the Customer environment and the Provider managed environment, or because both parties need to be involved in the management of a particular control. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 14 Appendix A includes additional considerations for determining how PCI DSS responsibilities may be assigned for each cloud service category. Appendix C illustrates a sample PCI DSS Responsibility Matrix, as guidance for how Providers and Customers can document PCI DSS responsibility assignments. The concept of shared or joint responsibility can be particularly tricky to deal with. While some services and functions will be relatively straightforward to scope and establish boundaries, many services and functions will overlap if

On this page Together, myID and Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM) provide flexible, easy and secure access to Online Services for DSPs. Machine credentials allow you to interact with government online services through Standard Business Reporting (SBR)-enabled software. How you set up these authentication and authorisation services depends on your circumstances and the type of Digital Service Provider (DSP) you are. Additional information is available if you are a: myID A Digital ID, such as myID allows you to prove your identity when accessing Online services for DSPs and other government online services . To access Online Services for DSPs , you need a myID with either: Basic identity strength - only allows access to some request types Standard or Strong identity strength - allows access to the full suite of request types. See the myID website to find out how to set up . Note: myID cannot be used for SBR services. You will need a machine credential to transact with the ATO through your software. Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM) RAM is an authorisation service that allows you to act on behalf of a business or entity online when linked with your Digital ID. You need to log into RAM using Digital ID, such as myID. To link online, an eligible principal authority needs to set up a Digital ID with a Strong identity strength. If the principal authority is unable to reach a Strong identity strength, check if there is an existing principal authority that can link you to the Australian business number (ABN). Alternatively, you can contact the ATO to link the ABN to a myID with a Standard identity strength. Once linked, you can access government online services and manage who can act on behalf of the business. If there are existing principal authorities linked to the business, an email notification will be sent to notify them that you have linked to the ABN. When authorising an individual to act on behalf of your business, they will receive an authorisation request which they must accept in RAM. Visit Relationship Authorisation Manager for more information on how to get started or to find out how to link your business as a principal authority . Unable to achieve a Standard identity strength If you’re a principal authority and unable to achieve at least a Standard identity strength, check whether another principal authority can, so they can link the business. Check the myID website for the latest list of accepted identity documents or email DPO@ato.gov.au for assistance or further advice. RAM for SBR-enabled software For SBR-enabled software you use RAM to: authorise a Machine Credential Administrator (MCA) create machine credentials to interact with government online services through your software notify government agencies about the software you’ll be using to interact with them through My Cloud Software Services (only the Office of the Student Identifiers Registrar, Department of Education, Skills and Employment). Machine credentials (M2M solution) Machine credentials allow DSPs, businesses and registered tax and BAS agents to interact with ATO online services through their SBR-enabled software. Machine credentials are installed from RAM and used in your SBR-enabled software. You’ll need to create a machine credential if you: are a DSP who offers cloud-based SBR-enabled software use desktop or locally hosted software. Including employers using a Single Touch Payroll (STP) desktop solution that reports directly to the ATO. Employers who are unsure of their connection to the ATO should seek guidance from their software provider in the first instance. Create a machine credential You can create a machine credential if you are a: Once the machine credential is created, the principal authority or MCA will be responsible for its use in the business. To create a machine credential, follow the step-by-step instructions on how to install a machine credential guide in RAM. Additional information is available if you are a: Machine credential expiry Machine credentials expire 2 years from the date of creation. The machine credential custodian (person who created or claimed the machine credential) is notified at 60, 30 and 7 days prior to expiry. Notifications are sent to the custodians current business email address as listed in RAM. Where the custodian is no longer authorised, the other machine credential administrators will be notified. Principal authorities will be notified if there are no machine credential administrators for the business. You can incorporate a machine credential renewal function in your software. This allows a machine credential to be automatically renewed when it’s used to access your software within 14 months of its expiry. The machine credential (M2M) renewal FAQs in Online services for DSPs provides information to help you integrate this into your software. If a renewal function is not available in your software, a new machine credential will need to be created using the same name as the existing one. To create a machine credential, follow the step-by-step instructions on how to install a machine credential in RAM. To ensure continued access: the new machine credential should be created before the existing one expires Note: If the new machine credential is on a different device and is given the same name as the first machine credential, then the 2 machine credential’s exist on both machines, both with the same name, but with different serial numbers. Both will display in RAM and the unused credential should be revoked ) cloud software developers need to create the new machine credential locally hosted or desktop

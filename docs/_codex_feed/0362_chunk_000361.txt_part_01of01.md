a multitude of needs to be scoped in from the start. Best-practice requires that the business case for any new touchscreen payment technology requires accessibility to be embedded as a key decisioning point at all project phases from initiation to closure, with a ‘no go’ approach to inaccessible solutions. During design, and prior to implementation, it is strongly recommended that users living with a range of impairments be engaged to trial the touchscreen payment solution and provide feedback. Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals 27 4. SUPPORTING MATERIAL AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION Accessibility is a funded priority Specific funding for accessibly design, testing and review has to be factored into the project scope and business case, at an equal priority level as all other critical implementation factors such as security testing. Also, in general, retrofitting accessibility is more expensive than incorporating it into the design from the outset. Consulting with people with disability By consulting with people living with a range of impairments from initial project planning and through key stages of the project, feedback can be incorporated into the business/user requirements to positively influence the accessibility outcomes of the solution. Consultation outcomes • Invite feedback from a representative cross-section of the community who can share their experiences of living with a range of disabilities. • Be clear on the specific outcomes you’re seeking feedback on so they can channel their input strategically. Attendance • When issuing invitations in an accessible format, be sure to ask for people to identify their accessibility requirements to be able to attend any forums. • Ensure the venue is accessible and appropriate for the group and their required adjustments e.g. bringing carers or being wheelchair accessible. • Limit group size and hold more sessions if necessary, to allow for everyone’s input to be heard. • Budget for potential assistive requirements such as having an Auslan sign language interpreter in the room or providing technology such as hearing loops for people with hearing impairments. Materials • All materials to be created in accessible and alternative formats and shared with the attendees ahead of the session. • Send a follow-up thank you note highlighting key themes discussed with an attendance register. Facilitation • Ensure the facilitator is experienced in running consultation sessions and able to navigate and value multiple perspectives. • Actively listen to accurately capture feedback and take notes for future reference. • Structure the agenda to allow sufficient time for input, particularly if there are people with more complex communication needs represented in the session. The UK’s National Disability Authority provides best-practice ideas in its ‘Ask Me’ Guidelines for Effective Consultation with People with Disabilities.

SUPPORTING MATERIAL AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION ➜ Accessible sourcing Diversity, inclusion and accessibility objectives should ideally be built into organisational supply chain policies, particularly around the sourcing of payment terminal hardware or software, as general best-practice. For payment projects, it is beneficial to: • Ensure the business sponsor and the entire project team understands the critical importance of accessibility and are able to brief suppliers on the organisation’s position relating to its significance, equal to other factors e.g. security. • Include accessibility as a must-have in all scoping and tender requirements. • Ask suppliers to demonstrate evidence of the solution being accessible across a wide range of impairments and meeting the practices outlined in the Guidelines. • Consider the sourcing of touchscreen payment technology against Australian Standard AS EN 301 549:2016 ‘Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of ICT products and services’.

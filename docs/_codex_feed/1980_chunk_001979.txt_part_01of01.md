Two Subway® locations have become the first major Australian quick-service restaurants to serve-up eftpos QR code payments ahead of its plan to roll out the cutting-edge technology to innovation-hungry guests in partnership with Australian-made Beem mobile wallet, both of which are part of newly formed Australian Payments Plus (AP+). Guests at Subway’s North Sydney (Miller Street) and Brisbane City (460 George Street) restaurants will be able to use eftpos QR via Beem wallet to pay for their favourite Subway 6-Inch®, Subway Footlong®, salad, or wrap. The technology will open the door to a raft of richer rewards, offers and opportunities to connect with and delight guests and is expected to be rolled out across more restaurants in the coming months. The launch of eftpos QR code payments for Subway® in Australia is a significant milestone for both the retail and payments industries and delivers on a commitment by eftpos (now part of AP+) to rapidly have the technology live and in market. Mark Britt, Managing Director AP+ Digital Plus said: “Australians have been telling us they want their mobile payments experience to be more valuable, and to cut down on the fumble-factor by unifying and orchestrating what were once a mish mash of separate paper and plastic cards. eftpos QR payments makes this happen in a simple and elegant way.” Subway® Australia & New Zealand Communications Manager, Rhys Reynolds, said giving guests the option to pay using eftpos QR just makes sense for the brand. “We know that customisation and personalisation are driving factors for our guests,” said Mr Reynolds. “Subway guests can choose from an array of fresh, healthier ingredients to create a sub, salad or wrap that’s just right for them! We’re excited to extend that choice beyond the sandwich unit, to include cutting-edge payment options.” For a limited time, guests at Subway® North Sydney and Brisbane City restaurants will also be able load up on loyalty rewards with triple SubCard® Reward Dollars on offer. “AP+ is committed to providing Australian consumers and merchants with better, simpler, highly secure and data-rich payments experiences no matter the form factor, or where the shop is – online, mobile or at the checkout,” Mark Britt said.

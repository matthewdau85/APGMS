described in Section 3.4. Individuals with significantly less experience or who are looking for a more general overview of the PCI DSS may wish to consider a different PCI SSC training program. ISA qualification signifies only that an individual has met all applicable ISA requirements as set forth in the ISA Qualification Requirements document, including successful completion of required ISA Program training and passing all required ISA Program examinations. ISA qualification may not entitle an ISA to perform special functions or conduct PCI DSS Assessments. ISA qualification is not transportable, and qualification as an ISA or Sponsor Company is not assignable or transferable. For the purposes of the ISA Program, an individual’s ISA qualification applies only for his or her Sponsor Company (and not for any other organization), and only while that individual remains employed by the Sponsor Company that employed him or her when initially qualified as an ISA (the “Initiating Sponsor Company”). Additionally, for ISA Program purposes, qualification as an ISA permits an ISA to perform only PCI DSS Assessments of his or her Initiating Sponsor Company. Individual ISA qualification immediately and automatically terminates upon interruption of employment with the Initiating Sponsor Company or any other failure to comply with the requirements of or satisfy the eligibility requirements of the ISA Program. Except as otherwise specified herein, an individual who loses ISA qualification and later satisfies applicable requirements may reapply for ISA qualification at any time. Whether a Sponsor Company can use an ISA for its own or its Affiliates’ (defined in section 2.1) compliance validation for a given payment card brand or acquirer is determined by that payment card brand or acquirer. 1.2 Application Process Sponsor Company Application ISA Company registration is accessed through the ISA Training page on the Website. After the candidate submits its company and contact information, the ISA Program Manager will provide access to the Portal. The candidate can then log into the Portal to complete its application submittal. The candidate Sponsor Company must submit the following materials (collectively referred to as a “Sponsor Company Application Package”) to PCI SSC to apply for initial qualification as a Sponsor Company:  Sponsor Attestation (see Appendix A), executed by a duly authorized executive officer of the candidate Sponsor Company, attesting to the matters set forth therein;  Training request for each ISA candidate for whom the Sponsor Company is seeking ISA qualification; and Qualification Requirements For Internal Security Assessors (ISA), Version 2.1 March 2021 © 2021 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All rights reserved. Page 3  Copy of a current company formation document or equivalent approved by PCI SSC (the “Business License”), including year of incorporation and location(s) of offices. Refer to the Document Library on the Website—Business License Requirements—for more information.  To facilitate preparation of the Sponsor Company Application Package, refer to Appendix B. Initial Sponsor Company Qualification PCI SSC will notify the Sponsor Company candidate in writing if the Sponsor Company has been qualified. A successful Sponsor Company applicant is considered qualified as a Sponsor Company for a period of one (1) year from the date of its initial qualification, subject to continued satisfaction of applicable Sponsor Company Requirements. ISA Application and Qualification A Sponsor Company in Good Standing may apply to qualify any of its full-time employees as an ISA at any time by submitting to PCI SSC (on behalf of its ISA candidate) an ISA training request through the Portal. This submission can occur in connection with the Sponsor Company’s initial qualification or thereafter. Once PCI SSC receives the ISA training request, the candidate ISA is eligible to receive ISA training and qualification as described further herein. ISA candidates who complete training and related examinations successfully are considered qualified as ISAs for a period of one (1) year from the date of initial ISA qualification, subject to continued satisfaction of all other applicable qualification requirements by the ISA and its Initiating Sponsor Company. Note: PCI SSC will notify candidate Sponsor Companies that do not meet applicable requirements or otherwise fail to qualify, and all such candidates may appeal within 30 days from the date of notification. Appeals must be addressed to the PCI SSC General Manager and will follow applicable procedures as determined by PCI SSC. PCI SSC reserves the right to reject any applicant (ISA or Sponsor Company) if PCI SSC determines in its discretion, or has reason to believe, that the applicant fails to satisfy applicable ISA Program requirements or has, within two (2) years prior to the application date, engaged in any conduct that would have entitled PCI SSC to revoke qualification. Delivery Instructions Sponsor Company Application Packages and all other materials required hereunder must be submitted in English, include all required documentation, and be submitted via the Portal. For questions or requests for Portal access, contact the ISA Program Manager at isa@pcisecuritystandards.org. 1.3 Requests for Additional Information PCI SSC reserves the right to require Sponsor Companies or ISAs to provide additional documentation or information to confirm adherence to the ISA Qualification Requirements, Sponsor Attestation, and/or any other requirements of the ISA Program. All such additional documentation and information must be submitted in English or with a certified English translation. Responses must be received by PCI SSC no later than three (3) weeks from the date of the corresponding PCI SSC Qualification Requirements For Internal Security Assessors (ISA), Version 2.1 March 2021 © 2021 PCI Security Standards Council,

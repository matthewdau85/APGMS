earlier years of 1901 to 1982 there is an online Index to Explanatory Memoranda that was produced by the Parliamentary Library that will tell you if an EM or similar document was produced for a Bill. The Federal Register of Legislation no longer publishes copies of all the Bills and EMs for each year. For Acts from 1997 onwards the Register provides a link to the APH website Bills page at the bottom of the All versions page under the heading Originating Bill and Explanatory Memorandum . Links to Bills before they become an Act and Bills that are not passed by Parliament are not available through the Federal Register of Legislation, but you can search for them on the APH Parlinfo database at https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/ . Where can I find the Bill and EM of an Act published on the Register? The Federal Register of Legislation provides a link to the APH website Bills page for Acts published on the Register from 1997 onwards. The Bill page contains copies of all available documents and information about the passage of the Bill through Parliament. The link to the Bill page, if available, can be found at the bottom of the All versions tab for each Act under the heading Originating Bill and Explanatory Memorandum . Where no link to a Bill page is available on the Register, copies of Bills and EMs from 1901 to current can usually be found by searching the Parinfo database on the Parliament House website at https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/ . Where can I find the Corporations Law? The Corporations Law was created within section 82 of the Corporations Act 1989 by the Corporations Legislation Amendment Act 1990 , Act No 110, 1990. Compilations of the Corporations Act 1989 , which include the Corporations Law, are available on the All versions tab for this title.

There are generally three options for linking to legislation: Link format What it links to www.legislation.gov.au/[title ID] always the latest version of a law www.legislation.gov.au/[title ID]/[yyyy-mm-dd] a particular version of a law - use only if the intent is to link to a historic version www.legislation.gov.au/[title ID]/versions] the series page - this shows all available versions of a law and any instruments or notices enabled by it To create a link you can copy the URL of the page you are viewing.

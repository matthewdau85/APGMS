Settlement will always be effected on the exchange balances. 592 1.3. Interest As covered in PART 9, clause 9.2.6, interest will be payable (as normal) on any exchanged Item in respect of which, settlement is effected later than the day on which that Item is exchanged for value. 593 Debit Items Where a Disabling Event occurs and other Tier 1 Framework Participants are asked, by a Disabled Framework Participant, to hold Debit Files that would have been exchanged in those other Members’ outward exchanges if not for a Disabling Event, those held Debit Files should retain the original PD-Day.

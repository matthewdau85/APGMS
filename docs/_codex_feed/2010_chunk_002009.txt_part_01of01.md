or alleged contravention of a Reportable Conduct. However, there may be times when a disclosure of a work-related grievance can still be treated as a Reportable Conduct. This is where: • the disclosure is about detrimental treatment, or the threat of detrimental treatment, you have suffered as a consequence of making, or proposing to make, a disclosure of a Reportable Conduct; • the disclosure has significant implications for the AP+ Group and the information suggests misconduct beyond your personal circumstances; • the disclosure also includes information of Reportable Conduct (a mixed disclosure); or • the disclosure is made to a legal practitioner for the purposes of seeking legal advice or representation about the operation of the whistleblower laws. 1 As defined in section 5.a of this policy. Australian Payments Plus Limited ABN 19 649 744 203 Confidential | 5 5. PROTECTION AND SUPPORT We understand that you may be concerned about the potential repercussions of being identified as a result of reporting your concerns. We are committed to supporting you and taking all reasonable steps to protect you against detrimental conduct for a Whistleblower Disclosure. a. When do you qualify for protection? A disclosure of information by you qualifies for protection under this policy (Whistleblower Disclosure) if it meets the following requirements: 1. you have reasonable grounds to suspect the information concerns misconduct, or an improper state of affairs or circumstances; 2. the information relates to Reportable Conduct (see section 3 above); 3. you are an Eligible Person as described in section 3 above; and 4. you have made the disclosure to an Eligible Recipient set out in section 6 below. In addition, you may be entitled to the legal protections set out below in section 5.e. b. What protections and support do we provide? Protecting your identity Your identity, or any information that would likely identify you, will not be shared with anyone and it is illegal for us to share this information except in the following circumstances: • you provide us with consent; or • it is reasonably necessary to investigate the Whistleblower Disclosure and: o the information shared is not of your identity as the whistleblower; and o we have taken all reasonable steps to reduce the risk that you will be identified from the information; or • the disclosure is to a legal practitioner to seek legal advice; • the disclosure is permitted or required by law (e.g. to ASIC, APRA or the Australian Federal Police). We will take reasonable steps to protect your identity and information in your Whistleblower Disclosure that is likely to identify you. Please note that, while we will take all reasonable steps to protect your identity, it may be difficult if your concern relates to information that only a few people know about or was shared with you confidentially. We may share non-identifying information about your Whistleblower Disclosure with our executive leadership team and our governance bodies (e.g. the AP+ Board, the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee). Protecting you from detriment It is illegal for a person to engage in conduct that causes detriment to an Eligible Person if that conduct is in relation to their Whistleblower Disclosure. We will take reasonable steps to protect you from Detrimental Conduct. Detrimental Conduct means any actual or threatened conduct against you or another person for making, or proposing to make, or being involved in the investigations of, a Whistleblower Disclosure. Detrimental Conduct includes: Australian Payments Plus Limited ABN 19 649 744 203 Confidential | 6 • termination, suspension, demotion or involuntary transfer; • bullying, intimidation or harassment; • over or under work; • harm or injury (including psychological harm); • damage to you including your property, reputation, business or financial position. Not all conduct will amount to Detrimental Conduct. For example, managing poor work performance in accordance with the AP+ Group performance management procedures, work misconduct unrelated to your Whistleblower Disclosure (including where you intentionally make a disclosure where you know it isn’t true or is misleading) or action taken to protect you from Detrimental Conduct. c. Protection to those mentioned in Whistleblower Disclosure The AP+ Group will take steps to ensure the fair treatment of employees of the AP+ Group who are the subject of, or mentioned in, Whistleblower Disclosures. These steps will include the following: • disclosures will be handled confidentially, to the extent practicable and appropriate in the circumstances; • each disclosure will be assessed and may be the subject of an investigation; • the objective of an investigation will be to determine whether there is enough evidence to substantiate or refute the matters reported; • when an investigation needs to be undertaken, the process will be objective, fair and independent; • an employee who is the subject of a disclosure will be advised about the subject matter of the disclosure as and when required by principles of natural justice and procedural fairness and prior to any actions being taken; and • an employee who is the subject of a disclosure may contact the Uprise, Employee Assistance Program for counselling and support. d. Counselling and support An Eligible Person can seek counselling and support from our confidential counselling service through the Uprise, Employee Assistance Program if you are a current or former employee. We encourage you to seek support as this may be a difficult time for you. Details of how to access and use the Uprise employee assistance program can

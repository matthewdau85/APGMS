Specifically, from 1 September 2016, Large Merchants are required to ensure that their customer surcharges for accepting credit, debit and prepaid card payments do not exceed the cost of acceptance for each of those payment types. The requirement applies to all other merchants from 1 September 2017. This document summarises the key elements of these reforms. More information is available through the Q&As created by the RBA and the ACCC. F.2 BENEFITS TO MERCHANTS The framework emphasises the right of merchants to surcharge to cover their acceptance costs and signal differences in costs to consumers. It also improves the transparency of payment costs to merchants. F.3 PERMITTED SURCHARGES AND COST OF ACCEPTANCE Merchants are entitled to levy surcharges for card transactions as long as they do not exceed the cost of acceptance for the Merchant for that scheme at that time. The cost of acceptance is the average cost for a card scheme for a particular reference period, calculated by expressing the total value of all merchant service fee/s and other applicable fees and premiums paid by you to us or third party payment facilitators as a percentage of the total value of all card transactions for that scheme during that reference period. F.4 MERCHANT FEE STATEMENTS Each month and annually from 1 June 2017, we will provide you with a fee statement, indicating the average fees applicable to the card transactions we acquire for you, to help you calculate your costs of acceptance for the following: (a) debit card schemes (which include prepaid card schemes in all cases): eftpos (administered by eftpos Payments Australia Limited), Debit Mastercard, and Visa Debit; and,173 172 Inserted effective 1/6/17, version 005 r&p 001.17 173 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 1 - INTRODUCTION AND MEMBER OBLIGATIONS ANNEXURE F NOTICE OF STANDARD MERCHANT PRICING FOR CREDIT, DEBIT AND PREPAID CARD TRANSACTIONS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 67 (b) credit card schemes: MasterCard Credit, and Visa Credit. This transparency will help merchants to know how much it costs them to accept card payments and will also enable merchants to make more informed decisions about whether to surcharge different payment methods. The fee statement will clearly detail: (a) the reference period to which the fee statement relates; (b) the fees paid by you to us in relation to the card transactions we acquired for you during the reference period; these will be the aggregate of merchant service fees, Terminal rental fees, gateway or fraud prevention fees, and any other fees for processing transactions (such as international service assessments, switching fees and fraud-related chargeback fees, but not the cost of any actual chargebacks); (c) the total value of card transactions we acquired for you during the reference period; and (d) the average cost of acceptance for card transactions by scheme. The fee statement will typically follow the format set out below: MERCHANT FEE STATEMENT FOR THE PERIOD [ ] TO [ ] (Statement Period) eftpos / eftpos Prepaid Debit Mastercard/ Mastercard Prepaid Mastercard Credit Visa Debit / Visa Prepaid Visa Credit Other* TOTAL VALUE OF CARD TRANSACTIONS $AUD (“X”) TOTAL VALUE OF FEES $AUD (“Y”) AVERAGE COST OF ACCEPTANCE (“Y/X%”) * Acquirers are encouraged, but not obliged, to disclose acceptance costs for card payment types not expressly covered by the reforms (e.g. Union Pay, JCB, Diners Club). Note: Merchants will be able to surcharge any of the cards covered by the RBA’s standard up to the average percentage cost of acceptance in their annual statement for that card type. However, some merchants may have other costs of accepting a particular type of card that they would like to include in their surcharge. These may include: • gateway fees paid to a payment service provider IAC CODE SET VOLUME 1 - INTRODUCTION AND MEMBER OBLIGATIONS ANNEXURE F NOTICE OF STANDARD MERCHANT PRICING FOR CREDIT, DEBIT AND PREPAID CARD TRANSACTIONS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 68 • the cost of fraud prevention services paid to an external provider • any Terminal costs paid to a provider other than the merchant’s acquirer or payments facilitator • the cost of insuring against forward delivery risk. This applies to agents (such as travel agents) who pay an external party to insure against the risk that the agent will be liable to a customer for the failure of a principal supplier (such as an airline

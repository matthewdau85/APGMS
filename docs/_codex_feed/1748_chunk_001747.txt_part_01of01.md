Reflect -Reconciliation Action Plan The AP+ vision to create an open, vibrant and sustainable payments ecosystem in Australia, that benefits all Australians, can’t succeed in isolation from ensuring that we have an equal and equitable Australia, that is unified and where First Australians are some of the key beneficiaries of the vision we deliver. We believe that we have an important role in specifically addressing barriers to financial inclusion, but also using our influence and position within the financial and broader economic system to spearhead the key components of reconciliation as put forward in our Reflect RAP.

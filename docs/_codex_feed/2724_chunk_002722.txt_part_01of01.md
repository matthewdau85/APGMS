general adherence to reporting requirements as evidenced by sampled ROCs.

Page 18 1052300.5 8.1 Ethics The QSA Company must adhere to professional and business ethics, perform its duties with objectivity, and limit sources of influence that might compromise its independent judgment in performing PCI SSC Assessments. PCI SSC has adopted a PCI SSC Code of Professional Responsibility (the “Code,” available on the Website) to help ensure that PCI SSC-qualified companies and individuals adhere to high standards of ethical and professional conduct. All PCI SSC-qualified companies and individuals must advocate, adhere to, and support the Code. QSA Companies and Assessor-Employees are prohibited from performing PCI DSS Assessments of entities that they control or are controlled by, and entities with which they are under common control or in which they hold any investment. QSA Companies and Assessor-Employees must not enter into any contract with a Customer that guarantees a compliant ROC. QSA Companies must fully disclose in the Report on Compliance if they assess Customers who use any security-related devices or security-related applications that have been developed or manufactured by the QSA Company, or to which the QSA Company owns the rights, or that the QSA Company has configured or manages. Each QSA Company agrees that when it (or any Assessor-Employee thereof) recommends remediation actions that include one of its own solutions or products, the QSA Company will also recommend other market options that exist. Each QSA Company must adhere to all independence requirements as established by PCI SSC. For a complete list, please see Section 2.2 in the QSA Qualification Requirements. 8.2 Feedback Process At the start of each PCI DSS Assessment, the QSA Company must direct the Customer to the QSA Feedback Form on the Website and request that the Customer submit the completed form to PCI SSC through the PCI SSC website following the PCI DSS Assessment. Any payment card brand, acquiring bank, or other person or entity may submit QSA Feedback Forms to PCI SSC to provide feedback on a PCI DSS Assessment, QSA Company, or Assessor-Employee. Link to Feedback Form: https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/assessors_and_solutions/qualified_security_assessors_feedback Note: Assessor-Employees are permitted to be employed by only one QSA Company at any given time.

Page 19 1052300.5 8.3 Remediation Process QSA Companies that do not meet all applicable quality assurance standards set by PCI SSC may be offered the option to participate in PCI SSC’s QSA Company Quality Remediation program (“Remediation”). PCI SSC may offer Remediation in connection with any quality assurance audit, any violation (as defined in the QSA Qualification Requirements), or any other PCI SSC Program-related quality concerns, including but not limited to unsatisfactory feedback from Customers or Participating Payment Brands. The Remediation process includes:  Remediation overview call and signed Remediation Agreement.  Remediation Period of at least 120 days.  QSA Company listing on the QSA List updated to “red” to notify merchants/service providers.  An AQM case manager assigned to the QSA Company to offer support as it works to bring its quality level to the expected baseline standard of quality.  The expectation of strong commitment from the QSA Company to achieve successful completion.  Fees for review of work. 8.4 Revocation Process A QSA Company (or any Assessor-Employee thereof) may be subject to revocation of its PCI SSC qualification (“Revocation”) if found to be in breach of the Agreement or other QSA Requirements, including without limitation, for any of the following:  Failure to perform PCI DSS Assessments in accordance with the PCI DSS.  Violation of any provision regarding non-disclosure of confidential materials.  Failure to maintain at least one certified QSA Employee on staff.  Failure to maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidential and sensitive information.  Unprofessional or unethical business conduct.  Failure to successfully complete any required PCI SSC training.  Cheating on any PCI SSC training exam. Upon notification of pending QSA Company Revocation by PCI SSC, the QSA Company or Assessor-Employee will have 30 days in which to appeal the ruling in writing to PCI SSC. Revocation will result in the QSA Company or Assessor-Employee being removed from the QSA List or search engine, as applicable. In the event of QSA Company Revocation, the QSA Company must immediately cease all advertising of its QSA Company qualification. It must also immediately cease soliciting for and performing all pending and active assessments unless otherwise instructed by PCI SSC, and comply with the post- revocation requirement specified in the QSA Agreement. Refer to the QSA Qualification Requirements for details on the Revocation process. Note: Revocation of QSA Company or Assessor- Employee qualification results in automatic revocation of all other PCI SSC qualifications that require QSA Company or Assessor-Employee qualification (e.g., PA-QSA and P2PE QSA).

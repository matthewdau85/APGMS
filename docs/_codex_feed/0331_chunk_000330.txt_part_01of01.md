printbar, of very fine points that emit high-intensity light. Each diode is individually switched to control data transmission to the photoreceptor. The major proponent of LED technology is Océ Printing Systems that manufactures a range of continuous MICR printers ranging in speed from 250 to 450 ppm and have multiple resolutions of 300 and 600 dpi in the same machine. 4.4.3 Electron Beam Imaging Electron Beam Imaging, formally known as Ion Deposition, is mechanically simpler than Laser or LED printing. A rigid drum coated with a dielectric surface replaces the photoreceptor drum. The write head, is known as a print cartridge, and has a series MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 35 AusPayNet September 2017 of very small holes from which electrons are expelled towards the imaging drum. Each hole is individually controlled to create the data stream. The electrons charge the drum that then selectively attracts toner. The toner is transferred to paper using very high pressure. The toner is then (optionally) fused using a Xenon lamp that emits very high intensity light to melt the toner. The toner that is not transferred to the paper is scraped from the drum with a doctor blade and the residual electrical charge removed by an erase rod before the printing process recommences. This technology has been developed by Delphax Systems, a Division of Xerox Corporation. The print tends to be more black than that from laser or LED systems and the dots are more diffused. The toner has required considerable development to achieve a satisfactory level for MICR printing. Printers are manufactured with 300 and 600 dpi resolutions and current models run at 300 ppm upwards. In a more recent development of this technology, Delphax has designed a new print engine known as the “Gemini”. This is incorporated into CheckTechnology Corporation’s “Imaggia” printer for high-volume cheque printing. This engine uses a flexible image belt that is charged by the print cartridge. Toner is attracted from the toner hopper to the charged areas of the image belt. This is then passed to a heated transfer belt where the toner particles become molten before being finally transferred to pre-heated paper. As the image belt completely transfers toner to the transfer belt, only the latter needs some cleaning. The CheckTechnology Imaggia printer has a resolution of 600 dpi and produces 220 A4 ppm. The print quality is significantly better than those from the earlier EBI engine. 4.4.4 Magnetography The Magnetographic process is used primarily by Nipson Printing Systems and differs from the other processes by replacing photosensitive or dielectric imaging surfaces with a more robust magnetic drum. The drum is aluminium based with a series of magnetisable coatings. This surface is selectively magnetised using a high- density multitrack head and these magnetised areas attract toner particles. A brush prior to the transfer stage removes excess toner not bound to the drum. The bound toner is transferred by pressure to the paper and then fused with a xenon lamp. A strong magnet then erases the magnetised areas of the drum, and any residual toner removed from the surface before repeating the imaging sequence. The current technology is at 480 dpi and gives a darker black, more diffused print than a laser at the same resolution. 4.4.5 Desk-top laser printers Low volume, desk-top MICR printers are now commonly available but care needs to be taken in selecting such printers to ensure that they consistently meet the specifications detailed in this Publication. The particular areas of concern are the MICR toner, its adhesion to the document and the E-13B font employed. Unless the printer specifically has a device to prevent non-MICR toner being used, there is potential for the different types of toners to be interchanged, with the resultant documents not meeting the signal strength standards. Likewise unless the E-13B font is of a fixed pitch, the size and spacing can be incorrect. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 36 AusPayNet September 2017 Because of their low output, these printers are not invariably required to be accredited. Their incorrect use can however cause considerable problems in the clearing system and Quality Assurance procedures and sampling requirements outlined in section 6 must be observed. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 37 AusPayNet September 2017 5 Reader/Sorter Operations 5.1 Recognition Technology There are two main methods of recognising MICR characters that relate to how the machines magnetise characters and then interpret the resultant electrical signal. These are known as waveform and matrix read technologies. The magnetic recognition technology is also supplemented with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on some machines. More recently Imaging and Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) functions have become available. These latter functions remove much of the work carried out by proof-machine operators as the written or printed amount can be interpreted and recorded electronically instead of being entered by keyboard then MICR encoded on the document. 5.1.1 Waveform Readers The MICR line is magnetised by passing over a write head and then read by moving past a magnetic read head that generates a very small electrical signal. The normal process uses the rate of change in this signal to generate a pattern that is unique for each character or symbol, this is the typical waveform image shown in this publication. An alternative method is to use the integrated waveform where the image is quite different, with no

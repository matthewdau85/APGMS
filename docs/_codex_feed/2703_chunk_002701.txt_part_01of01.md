PCI DSS Requirement 3.4. In this scenario, the entity would need to verify that the recordings contain only flat tones, and that the suppression method ensures the tones cannot be converted back to the original data. Even if only suppressed tones are stored and are not subject to Requirement 3.4, recording systems may still be in scope for other PCI DSS requirements if they have connectivity to the systems where CHD is present. Where the DTMF tones are not replaced with flat, token, or random sounds, the specific numbers associated with each key press can be recovered, meaning that PAN and SAD is retrievable and the unaltered DTMF tones are fully in scope for applicable PCI DSS requirements. To complement audio suppression of the DTMF tones, some solutions also integrate with the agent desktop environment to prevent PAN and SAD being captured or displayed on the agent’s screen. For example, while the agent is hearing suppressed DTMF tones, their desktop could show the payment- entry field being propagated with a pre-defined character, such as an asterisk (*). In this scenario, any screen captures of the agent desktop would show only the asterisk and would not contain any PAN or SAD.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 33 Depending on the particular implementation, DTMF suppression and masking technologies may be able to prevent PAN and SAD from entering the telephone environment, further reducing the applicability of PCI DSS to that environment. Of course, it would first have to be verified that all PAN and SAD are replaced with predefined sounds and characters before they reach the environment, and no PAN or SAD is present in the environment in any other form. Some implementations of DTMF masking rely on DTMF- detectionthis may introduce a delay in the masking, and the initial portion of the DTMF tones may not be masked (this is called “DTMF bleed”). It is important to ensure that all DTMF tones, including any initial small portions of “DMTF bleed” that may be inadvertently allowed through a masking process, are not present in the environment. A properly designed and deployed DTMF-masking solution can take not only the telephony environment, but also the agent environment and CRM system out of scope. Entities should avoid solutions that leave agent environments in scope unless there is an unavoidable business requirement to do so.

In this scenario, a service provider receives the voice call before it reaches the entity. The DTMF-masking device separates the voice from DTMF. Masked DTMF is sent to the entity through the carrier network. DTMF is processed and is either directly forwarded or sent as payment card data to a payment service provider through a secured line over the internet. Variations of this scenario may exist where, for example, the telecom company manages DTMF masking or the payment service provider manages both DTMF masking and the payment. This type of deployment could allow the telephony systems to be out of scope for PCI DSS. Diagram 7: Off-premises deployment of DTMF masking 6.4.1.2 On-premises deployment of DTMF masking On-premises deployment is also possible. Diagram 8 shows an example of such implementation. A device hosted within the entity infrastructure separates the DTMF from the voice and sends back the masked DTMF into the entity’s telephone systems. DTMF is either directly forwarded or sent as cardholder data to a payment service provider through a secured line over the internet. The cardholder data is securely sent to a payment service provider.

The telephone switch is shown in scope as it may be considered as a demarcation point or as a “connected to” device. However, further analysis may be necessary to determine if the remaining part of the entity’s network is in scope for PCI DSS. (see the PCI SSC Information Supplement, Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation). The devices will need to be securely configured and patched. Any remote access must be configured as per PCI DSS requirements. The connection to the payment service provider must be secured. Finally, the SBC and the DTMF devices must be correctly configured to ensure that no DTMF bleed occurs. It is recommended to include a regular review of the signal to validate the efficiency of the DTMF solution. Diagram 8: On-premises deployment of DTMF masking 6.4.2 Unattended Telephony Technologies In an unattended transaction, the agent is not in contact with the customer for the entirety of the call. Technologies used for unattended transactions are often referred to as IVR (interactive voice response) applications or automated call-handling solutions. In this scenario, the agent typically switches the call to the IVR or call-handling solution

Elissa Walker welcomed members and guests. The group then covered matters of administration: Members were given an overview of the top four priorities that group will be focussing on in the year ahead: Artificial intelligence DSP roles Cyber threat and Data security Consent Tax 3.0 – Digital Think Tank Insights Members were given a playback of the Tax 3.0 workshop and discussion held at the April SWG. Insights from the workshop shaped conversation at the ATO’s Digital Think Tank held in May. The Think Tank brought together key stakeholders from ATO, Treasury and the Department of Finance to explore the future of Australia’s tax and digital economy through the lens of the Tax 3.0 vision. The group covered topics such as: the evolving ecosystem and changing roles of participants how to better use data across the ecosystem and embed identity into transactions payments and reporting thinking. The need to understand and define what OECD Tax 3.0 concepts mean in the context of the Australian environment was also a common theme. ATO and Industry - Building common ground Elissa introduced ATO Chief Information Officer and Chief Security Officer Mark Sawade who reflected on his time and experiences with the ATO so far. On behalf of DSPANZ, Matthew Prouse provided insight into the role of DSPs within the broader government ecosystem and across the global economy. Mark acknowledged the value of ATO and DSPs working together and the importance of open communication. Small Business Future Tax Administration Blueprint and Roadmap Key Concepts and Deliverables The ATO has been engaging early with DSPs as part of developing a vision and blueprint for a digitised tax experience for small business. This reflects the DSPs role in delivering critical change to the ecosystem to support digitalisation. Over the next 24 months ATO will work with DSPs to co-design, test and deliver early initiatives. Focus areas include pre-lodgment assurance, prefill for sole traders, more regular BAS reporting and payment optimisation. DSPs have also been invited to submit an EOI to explore how the ATO can assist with defining guardrails in relation to embedding guidance in software (rules as code). The EOI period has now closed. Summary of the wholesale vulnerability assessment and group activity Vulnerability Assessment Members were given a summary of the ATO’s recent Wholesale Vulnerability Assessment, which identified internal and external opportunities to strengthen and improve governance, identity assurance, monitoring, and compliance to the Operational Security Framework (OSF). Further work is required to investigate actions and conduct a risk assessment of the vulnerabilities and the group activity on the day focussed on two items from the vulnerability assessment – Certification (independent & self-assessment) and Sharing/Privacy of data. Workshop Exercise Members workshopped two items to identify considerations, benefits and barriers. This input will help guide ATO decisions to uplift its policy and conditions that underpin our wholesale service offering. Members broke out into smaller groups for an interactive activity and provided answers to questions on: Sharing of data – What are the benefits and barriers of implementing privacy requirements? OSF certification – What are the benefits and barriers of reducing or removing self-assessment? Payday Super update While there has been no advice from Government to reconfirm policy and position at this stage, Treasury did release the exposure draft pre-caretaker period. Super Guarantee A comparison of what may be available in Wholesale (SBR), Online Services for Agents, Online Services for Business and Online Services for Individuals was provided to the group.

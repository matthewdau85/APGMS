under its own PCI DSS compliance assessment. The following 5 Refers to SAQ D version 1.1 – July 2015 6 This reference is to PCI DSS v3.1 – April 2015 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 12 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 are examples of documentation the TPSP may provide during a PCI DSS assessment, whenever significant changes occur, and/or annually, as applicable:  A high-level dataflow diagram showing how the TPSP’s services interface with the entity’s environment  Network diagrams  Evidence of system-patching methodology and, if applicable, secure coding methodology  List of the entity’s TPSPs and how each TPSP is connected to the entity’s environment, along with the role the TPSPs play—specifically, any chained/nested relationships  Results of the TPSP’s internal and external vulnerability scans, if available  Security policies and operational procedures If the TPSP is not yet compliant, it may provide its own project plan for its PCI DSS compliance path project plan or a copy of its Prioritized Approach for the service(s) provided, if available. The Prioritized Approach is a tool produced by PCI SSC to help entities implement PCI DSS requirements in a prioritized order that effectively addresses the respective risks. The tool may be downloaded from the PCI SSC’s Document Library at https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/documents.php. Another scenario to consider is if an entity engages a third party to augment the entity’s information technology or operational staff, using only the entity’s own processes and technology. In such a case, the third-party staff augmentation firm will likely not be independently assessed for its compliance with PCI DSS. However, the third-party employees embedded within the entity’s in-scope processes may need to be part of the entity’s own compliance validation exercise. This could include demonstrating that they follow the entity’s own procedures, have their work reviewed by the entity’s management, and are subject to all the same security controls as the rest of the entity’s staff—such as, but not limited to, background checks, security awareness training, and secure-coding training. The entity may also wish to consider the risk associated with engaging with a TPSP and how to limit the exposure to the entity’s PCI DSS scope. In addition, the entity may wish need to consider the additional effort associated with validating and potentially remediating the applicable system components and processes that fall into scope. For example, the entity may weigh its risk and time impact to perform an internal assessment of the TPSP’s systems and processes vs. hiring an external resource to audit the TPSP system on behalf of the entity. Ultimately, because the TPSP has not validated its compliance, the services provided may be in scope for the entity’s PCI DSS assessment and subsequently may result in a delay to the entity’s compliance validation. 3.2.3 Payment Card Brand Validated Providers Lists and Websites Payment card brands may maintain lists of validated TPSPs that satisfy specific brand enrollment programs, which typically include requirements to attain and maintain PCI DSS compliance. It is important for an entity to understand the scope of such the validation and the services listed. Please note that absence of a TPSP from a list does not preclude an engagement of the service provider, since some TPSPs choose not to be listed, although they have attained PCI DSS compliance. Similarly, the inclusion of a service provider on a published list does not by itself provide assurance that the services applicable The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 13 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 to the entity’s engagement are included in the compliance validation, or that all PCI DSS requirements that an entity wishes the TPSP to manage on its behalf are included in the validated service. Depending on the services provided by the TPSP to the entity, the information found on the payment card brand service provider listings may not provide the necessary assurance. Additional information may be needed from the TPSP for the services provided. 3.3 Perform Risk Assessment It is recommended an entity perform a thorough risk assessment on its TPSP based on an industry-accepted methodology. Understanding the level of risk associated with engaging a TPSP will help the entity in its decision-making process. An entity may need to create a tiered due diligence program with decision trees to handle different levels of risk, depending upon various factors such as:  The magnitude and type of the TPSP services provided (e.g., single contractor, cloud provider, etc.)  The volume of exposure to a CHD or CDE compromise  The probability and frequency of threats to the organization or its assets  Whether the TPSP has ever been involved in a compromise of cardholder data The PCI DSS Risk Assessment Guidelines provide further information for conducting a risk assessment and can be referenced by entities looking for more detailed guidance in this process. Below is a high-level list of some of the questions and topics that may be appropriate to consider as part of the risk assessment. The list is not exhaustive and is meant as a starting point for an organization to use when creating its own risk-assessment process: Security Governance and Risk Management  Does the TPSP have an information security

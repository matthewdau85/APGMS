Australian Payments Plus (AP+) has made good progress on its technical update to debit cards on mobile wallets. The update will ensure consumers can continue to make payments via eftpos from 1 Jan 2025. However, a small minority of consumers will need to remove and re-add their debit card to their mobile wallet. AP+ and the Australian Banking Association (ABA) urge everyone who has received a message from their bank about updating the debit card in their mobile wallet to do so before 1 Jan 2025. On 18 December AP+ released a statement informing consumers about an update being rolled out to eftpos on some debit cards in mobile wallets to ensure payments via eftpos process as normal from 1 January 2025. It is expected approximately 60,000 active cards 1 will not be updated automatically. Card issuers have been contacting their potentially impacted customers asking them to apply the update themselves by simply removing and re-adding their debit card. Lynn Kraus, CEO of AP+ says ‘I urge anyone who has received a message from their bank to update the debit card on their mobile wallet to do it today. Removing and re-adding your debit card is a quick fix that will ensure eftpos payments process as normal from 1 January 2025.’ Anna Bligh, CEO of the ABA says ‘Whilst banks have been proactively reaching out to the small group of customers impacted, some are yet to take the required action. It’s a straightforward process that will only take a matter of minutes and will ensure your debit card can continue to make payments into the new year.’ 1 Cards unable to be updated which have been used in the last three months.

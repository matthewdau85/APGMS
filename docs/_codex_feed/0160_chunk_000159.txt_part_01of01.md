other sector participants to discuss Building Block 16 (Unique identifiers and proxy register for cross-border payments). There was general agreement regarding participants potentially expanding Legal Entity Identifiers (LEI) to a broad range of legal entities. There was also a great deal of discussion regarding the use of identifiers for natural persons. Specifically, it was recommended that the FSB perform a deep dive on the use cases, bearing in mind the particular complexities of cross-jurisdictional privacy frameworks. The FSB is continuing with its deep dive into use cases. In July, the FSB published ‘ Options to improve adoption of the LEI, in particular for use in cross-border payments ’ (Building Block 16). This paper recommends broader use of the LEI globally, including within cross-border payments. In Australia, LEI usage is governed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and is required for derivative transaction reporting ( Regulatory Guide 251 ). Usage outside of derivative transaction reporting, particularly in cross-border payments, is limited. The Payments Market Practice Group (PMPG), in its white paper ‘ Global adoption of the LEI in ISO 20022 Payment Messages - 2021 ' notes that there a number of jurisdictions that either mandate or are considering mandating the use of LEIs. The PMPG white paper also provides market practice for LEI usage within ISO 20022 payment messages. While LEI usage is not mandated in Australia for payments, it is, for example, an optional element within the new HVCS ISO 20022 messages. Focus Area E: New Payments Infrastructures and Arrangements In July 2022, the BIS Innovation Hub, CPMI, IMF and the World Bank published a report to the G20, ‘ Options for access to and interoperability of CBDCs for cross-border payments ’ (Building Block 19). In November 2021, AusPayNet responded to a joint consultation by CPMI and Board of the International Organization of Securities Commission (IOSCO) on the ‘ Application of the principles for financial market infrastructures to stablecoin arrangements ’ (Building Block 18). In July 2022, CPMI and IOSCO published their guidance on the application of these principles, which was distributed to the members of the former working group of the Australian Payments Council who contributed to AusPayNet’s response . CPMI and IOSCO believe that the guidance is useful for stablecoin arrangements, including the relevant authorities charged with implementing these arrangements. The FSB’s roadmap progress In his April 2022 letter to the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting , held in Washington DC, the FSB chair noted the profound change to the global economy and financial markets caused by events such as the Covid 19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Despite this change, the FSB is continuing to coordinate work to advance the G20 cross-border payments roadmap. The FSB will further update the G20 Leaders on its progress at November’s G20 Leaders' Summit in Bali, Indonesia. The G20’s commitment The G20 Leaders are due to meet in Bali, Indonesia in November 2022. We anticipate that they will once again re-affirm their commitment to the G20 cross-border payments roadmap. The G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors have re-affirmed their commitment in their communique . What's planned for the rest of 2022 CPMI has commenced consultations on facilitating increased adoption of payment versus payment (PvP). AusPayNet is coordinating a response from its members. We are expecting additional reports and guidance on stablecoin arrangements and Central Bank Digital Currencies. We are also expecting additional reports on digital identities and liquidity bridges. As consultations and artefacts are produced, AusPayNet, through the CBPAC, will coordinate responses and activities to ensure the Australian payments industry is represented and prepared. Taking forward the roadmap - CPMI milestones committed for 2022 AusPayNet Summit 2022: Paving the Way Registrations are now open for the 2022 AusPayNet Summit, which will be held at the International Convention Centre (ICC) Sydney on Wednesday, 14 December and hosted by award-winning journalist and presenter, Helen Dalley. This years Summit, themed ‘Paving the Way’ will feature a who’s who in payments in a dynamic series of interviews, panel discussions and rapid-fire talks. These will include an address by RBA Governor Philip Lowe; and Australia’s Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services, The Hon Stephen Jones MP, who will outline the role of government in payments; as well as the ‘Big Debate’, on Australia’s readiness for digital currency. This event also provides a great opportunity for banking and payments industry professionals to network and make new connections.

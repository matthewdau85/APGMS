documentation, proof of configuration, and validation that PAN is not readable⎯all of which should support compliance with PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 and associated ROC Reporting Instructions. Information Supplement • Best Practices for Maintaining PCI DSS Compliance • January 2019 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 25 PCI DSS Requirement Examples of Evidence Explanation 6.5 Address common coding vulnerabilities in software- development processes as follows: ▪ Train developers at least annually in up-to-date, secure coding techniques, including how to avoid common coding vulnerabilities. ▪ Develop applications based on secure coding guidelines. ▪ Software-development policies and procedures requiring up-to- date training in secure coding techniques for developers ▪ Secure coding guidelines for each developing platform and coding language utilized to develop applications for the CDE ▪ Records of secure coding training received by each of the organization’s developers involved in application coding/maintenance including the following information: - Course Topics - Date and Duration of training - Name of staff member - Certification achieved (if applicable) The testing procedures for secure code development requires identification of training records as well as the personnel responsible for reviewing and addressing common coding vulnerabilities. Simply providing a policy document that requires developers to participate in secure development training courses is not sufficient to demonstrate that the training has happened. It is a common scenario that organizations do not rely on a single development platform or language; organizations commonly utilize multiple types of Software Development Kits (SDKs) to support their payment card processes. Therefore, development staff should be adequately trained to understand the inherent vulnerabilities of each development platform and language utilized to support the organization’s payment card processes. To that extent, a coding standard for one of the development languages is not adequate evidence that coding guidelines exist for all platforms and language used by the organization.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 26 PCI DSS Requirement Examples of Evidence Explanation 8.3.1 Incorporate multi-factor authentication for all non-console access into the CDE for personnel with administrative access. ▪ Firewall configurations demonstrating segmentation of CDE from the rest of the network ▪ Firewall configurations demonstrating that all administrative protocols require VPN connection, and that VPN connection requires multi-factor authentication ▪ Screenshot of failed (timed out) non-console connection (e.g., Remote Desktop Protocol) to a sample of systems in the CDE without VPN ▪ Screenshot of VPN client showing three input fields⎯username, password, and OTP ▪ Screenshot showing active VPN connection and successful RDP session Testing procedure as well as reporting instructions require the assessor to identify a sample of network and system components. Providing a policy document requiring usage of multi-factor authentication for all remote connections is not sufficient to demonstrate that the solution has been implemented and configured appropriately. Therefore, reporting instructions also require the assessor to review configurations and to explain how configuration enforces multi-factor authentication for all non-console access into the CDE. The collected screenshots identify administrative users and demonstrate that MFA is enforced (both successful and failed attempts). It is recommended that all collected evidence be retained for a minimum of three years to enable organizations to substantiate historic compliance statements and to allow for forensic analysis in case of a security breach. Moreover, to ensure compliance with contractual obligations and applicable laws, in some cases a longer retention period may be required15. Retained evidence may include, but is not limited to, digital or hard copies of case logs, audit results, work papers, e- mails, interview notes, and technical information such as screenshots and configuration settings. In the event that an organization prohibits a QSA Company from retaining evidence gathered during its annual PCI DSS assessment (for example, in high-security environments), the organization should work with the QSA Company to ensure that the evidence is retained securely in its environment in accordance with the QSA Qualification Requirements.16 Depending on the country where an entity is assessed, there may also be local or regional laws that the entity needs to consider. It is highly recommended that the organization and the QSA Company maintain a formal agreement that outlines each party’s responsibilities for evidence retention. 15 EY Law, Data retention and preservation – Overview on Requirements in Selected Countries, 2015. https://eylaw.ey.com/2015/07/17/data-retention-and-preservation-in-selected-countries/ 16 PCI Security Standards Council, QSA Program Guide V2.0, 2017. https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/QSA_Program_Guide_v2.0_Dec.pdf Information Supplement • Best Practices for Maintaining PCI DSS Compliance • January 2019 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 27 The evidence-retention process should include safeguards to prevent and detect the altering, tampering, or destruction of evidence. The process should also identify whether any alterations are permitted to collected evidence, including any associated metadata, while in storage. If changes are permitted, the process should identity who is permitted to make such changes and outline a method to record who, what, how, why, and when changes are made. . While an Information Security Management Solution (ISMS) can be used for this purpose, the process can also be implemented using checklists, file and folder structures, and a combination of digital signatures and hashing (see Appendix D: PCI DSS Compliance Program Activities,”

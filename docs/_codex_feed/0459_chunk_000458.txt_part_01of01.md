using the SWIFT PDS to send or receive payments, nominate and advise the Company and the System Administrator of a contact point(s) to whom information or enquiries must be directed in the event of processing difficulties. A list of contact points is shown in Annexure C.1. 9.9 HVCS Payments to Framework Participants Experiencing a Disabling Event304 Framework Participants with payments to be sent to any Framework Participant experiencing a Disabling Event that affects its ability to receive inward payments will need to consider the liquidity implications of continuing to forward payments to that Framework Participant via the SWIFT PDS. Framework Participants should also consider the urgency or special requirements of any payments to be sent to a Framework Participant experiencing a Disabling Event, as payments may be 301 Amended effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 302 Inserted effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 303 Amended effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 304 Amended effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES PART 10: TRANSITION ARRANGEMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 65 delayed in the SWIFT queue for some considerable time. 9.10 HVCS Payments to a Framework Participant During a Participant Fallback Period305 (a) If a Framework Participant’s Disabling Event causes a Participant Fallback Period to be declared, then Framework Participants with payments to be sent to the Affected Participant must continue to use SWIFT PDS, having regards to the liquidity implications and potential delays outlined above. The Participant Fallback Solution provides a means for the Affected Participant to send payments. It cannot be used as a means for the Affected Participant to receive payments outside of the SWIFT PDS. (b) Framework Participants must, to the best of their ability, pause sending payments to an Affected Participant if requested to do so by the Affected Participant. 9.11 Simultaneous Failure of Framework Participant’s Primary and Back-up Configurations306 If a Framework Participant’s Disabling Event causes both its Primary Computer Site and Back-up Computer Site to fail, such that it cannot fallback to the Back-up Computer Site and is prevented from sending or receiving payments in the usual way, then that Framework Participant will need to consider alternative arrangements for sending and receiving domestic high value payments. 9.12 Sending Payments307 If the Disabling Event is preventing a Framework Participant from sending payments in the usual way (Participant Outage), the Contingency Instructions may apply and a Participant Fallback Period could be declared. During this time the alternative arrangements for the Affected Participant to send payments in the HVCS will be the Participant Fallback Solution provided for in the Contingency Instructions. In accordance with Clause 9.46a), the Affected Participant must notify the System Administrator of the Disabling Event and obtain approval to use the Participant Fallback Solution by means of a Participant Fallback Period being declared. 9.13 Receiving Payments308 If the Disabling Event is preventing a Framework Participant from receiving payments in the usual way then that Framework Participant must be aware that in accordance with Clause 9.10, their inbound payments will, subject to appropriate testing by RITS, continue to be settled and will be queued on that Framework Participant’s SWIFT queue pending re-establishment of its connection. For the avoidance of doubt, and in accordance with Clause 9.10(a), the Participant Fallback Solution cannot be used as a means for that Framework 305 Inserted effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 306 Amended effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 307 Inserted effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 308 Inserted effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES PART 10: TRANSITION ARRANGEMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 66 Participant to receive payments outside of the SWIFT PDS. Further, that Framework Participant must continue to manage its ESA position in RITS throughout the Disabling Event and may in some circumstances consider requesting that other Framework Participants limit or pause the dispatch of further payments until the Disabling Event is resolved. 9.14 Need for Framework Participants to Re-establish SCI Connection in the Shortest Possible Time309 Payments forwarded to a Framework Participant experiencing a Disabling Event affective its inward payments processing will, subject to appropriate testing by RITS, be settled and queued on that Participant’s SWIFT queue pending re- establishment of its connection. It is therefore imperative that the Framework Participant endeavour to re-establish its SCI connection either from the Primary Computer Site or Back-up Computer Site without delay.310 9.15 Advise System Administrator When Disabling Event is resolved311 (a) Where any Framework Participant’s Disabling Event is resolved, and if applicable, its SWIFT PDS System is operating again in the normal way, that Framework Participant must immediately advise: (i) the System Administrator; and (ii) if the System Administrator has issued a RITS broadcast message to all HVCS Framework Participants in respect of the problem, the Company; of the change of status. (b) If a Participant Fallback Period is in operation at the time that the Disabling Event is resolved, the Affected Participant must comply with the Contingency Instructions with respect to the continued use of the Participant Fallback Solution and reversion to the SWIFT PDS for sending payments. 9.16 RITS or CSI (Central Site) Disabling Event312 (a) Both RITS and the CSI have two processors and each can withstand the failure of one of its two processors. However, if both processors should fail the system will revert to its back-up site. Until the move to processing using that back-up site is

overall security posture of large organizations. With structured management processes, large organizations can develop controls to keep data secure and minimize the threat of cardholder data loss and breaches. The guidance in this document was provided by PCI DSS for Large Organizations Special Interest Group, comprised of representatives from large global organizations and Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) companies that have performed PCI DSS assessments for large organizations. It identifies challenges that large organizations face, and provides guidance and techniques for overcoming them. The document covers a range of topics, including:  Roles, responsibilities, and ownership of PCI DSS functions  Sustaining compliance  Mergers and acquisitions  Managing acquirers and payment channels  Education and awareness  Systems management to maintain PCI DSS compliance  Multiple audits and assessment  Laws, regulations, and standards The information in this document is intended to serve as supplemental guidance. It does not supersede, replace, or extend requirements in any PCI SSC standard, nor does it constitute legal advice or endorse the use of any specific technologies, methodologies, products, or services. While all references made in this document are to PCI DSS version 3.2.1, the general principles and practices offered here may be applied beyond the context of PCI DSS to improve other security implementations, such as the Designated Entities Supplemental Validation (DESV). 2.1 Audience This guidance is intended for large organizations seeking information about how PCI DSS implementations can be organized and structured to facilitate more efficient management and support effective assessments. Although the information in this document is principally intended for large organizations, entities of all sizes may find this information valuable. 2.2 Navigating this Document Due to variations in the business structures and activities of large organizations, producing a guidance document for all challenges facing large organizations is not practical. As a result, this document is organized in a way that helps readers recognize the challenges faced by large organizations on topics considered most important by the Special Interest Group. Not all of these challenges will apply to every organization; however, many will be common within and across large organizations. Although the information in this document is targeted towards large organizations, it may also be useful for third parties and assessors supporting large organizations. Some sections in this document provide further guidance for specific types of large organizations, such as merchants, financial institutions, and service providers.

Large organizations come in many configurations, makeups, and sizes; however, determining whether an organization is considered “large” is often subjective. To a single location retail business, 100 employees may be considered large, while to a multi-national corporation, 100 employees may represent only a fraction of a department at one site. The characteristics of large organizations and the challenges they can face can vary considerably. Large organizations can be made up of loosely connected subsidiaries or franchises that span one or more geographic areas, or a related group of country-specific legal entities that report to a single corporate entity. Instinctively, the physical size of an organization is a principal feature in determining whether an organization is considered to be large. The size of a large organization can be defined by:  The number of physical locations, payment channels, payment points of interaction, employees, and devices across the company,  The overall number of continents, countries, cities, and locations in which that company conducts business,  The number and complexity of online or Internet-based services, or  Having a large volume or high value of payment card transactions.

Varying interpretations can lead to projects, groups, and departments that are

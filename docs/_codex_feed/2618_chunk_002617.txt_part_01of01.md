PCI SSC must have an executed and effective Sponsor Attestation from the ISA’s Initiating Sponsor Company; and 3. ISA candidate must review and accept the online PCI Individual Attestation Regarding Compliance with PCI SSC Code of Professional Responsibility and Program Requirements presented in the Assessor Portal during training. 3.2 Initial ISA Qualification Requirements For an individual to be initially qualified as an ISA, the following requirements (“Initial ISA Qualification Requirements”) must be satisfied: 1. All applicable ISA Eligibility Requirements must continue to be satisfied, the ISA candidate must continue to be a full-time employee of its Initiating Sponsor Company, and the Initiating Sponsor Company must continue to be in Good Standing; 2. The ISA candidate must complete all required initial ISA Program training successfully and pass legitimately on his or her own accord, each examination conducted as part of that training; 3. The ISA candidate must read and agree to adhere to the PCI SSC Code of Professional Responsibility; and 4. The ISA candidate must accept the ISA Attestation as part of the training and exam process.

The ISA must complete all required annual ISA Program training successfully and pass legitimately, on his or her own accord, each examination conducted as part of such training.

The ISA must continue to be employed by his or her Initiating Sponsor Company and that Initiating Sponsor Company must remain in Good Standing as a Sponsor Company; and 3. The ISA must comply with the terms of his or her ISA Attestation.

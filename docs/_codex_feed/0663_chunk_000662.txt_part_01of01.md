A. KEY INJECTION FACILITY REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 23 There are three phases for a device from manufacture through to installation for its intended use. The first is the manufacturing process itself. The first phase is not covered by these requirements. The second is the phase is post-manufacturing, from the time that the manufacturing process has been completed until the installation of the first key into the device. The third phase is pre-use, the period from the time the device is loaded with its initial key until it is installed for use. These requirements only cover the device from the post-manufacturing phase through to the pre-use phase when it is dispatched from the KIF plus any device returned from the field for reinjection. The intention of these requirements is to ensure that no Terminal goes into operation with compromised keys which could lead to a loss of customers’ PINs. Although facilities whose processes and systems meet these requirements may not be able to prevent the compromise of keys used in the facility, any such compromise should be detected with a high degree of certainty before the compromised keys can be used. This can be achieved by utilizing appropriate factors of:70 (i) device characteristics; (ii) device management; and (iii) environment. A.3 Key Injection Facility Audit Guide The Key Injection Facility Audit Guide, v3.01F1F71 should be used in conjunction with this document and provides additional information on how certain of the requirements are to be met. A.4 References The following documents were used in the development of these requirements: (i) AS 2805.6.1; (ii) ANSI X9.24 2004; (iii) ISO 11568-2; (iv) ISO 13491-2 2005; (v) CECS Manual – 2008; (vi) Visa PCI-PIN Security Requirements (Annex B) – Jan 2008; 70 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 71 Available on the AusPayNet Extranet at https://extranet.auspaynet.com.au/extranet/cs0corpdocs.nsf/NDX/KIF_AUDITGUIDE_CURRENT?OpenDocumen t&Login IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE A.

Appendix A of the KIF Audit Guide provides a cross reference table indicating how the requirements in the reference documents are covered by the requirements in this document. The original documents can be used to clarify the intention behind the requirements however, where a discrepancy might exist, this part will take precedence. A.5 Definitions For the purposes of this part, the following definitions apply. “Approved Device” [Deleted]72 “Asymmetric Key Pair” means the two related keys, called the public key and the private key that are used with the DEA 2 asymmetric algorithm. Note: DEA 2 is specified in AS 2805.5.3. “Certification Authority” and “CA” means an entity which issues digital certificates for use by other parties. It is an example of a trusted third party. CAs are characteristic of many public key infrastructure (PKI) schemes. “Cipher Text” means plain text that has been enciphered. “Cleartext Key” has the same meaning as Plaintext Key. “Digital Certificate” means a digital certificate is used to bind together a public key with an identity in the form of a public key certificate. It contains information such as the name of a person or an organization, their address, and so forth. The certificate can be used to verify that a public key belongs to an individual. “Dual Control” means the process of utilizing two or more entities (usually persons) operating in concert to protect sensitive functions or information whereby no single entity is able to access or use the materials. “Key Injection Device” and “KID” means an approved SCD which is loaded with keys for injection into devices within the KIF, e.g., is used to inject acquirer supplied keys into a PED. 72 Deleted effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE A. KEY INJECTION FACILITY REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 25 “Key Injection Facility” and “KIF” means a secure facility which contains an SCD for key generation and/or injection. The level of security will be determined by the security requirements of the SCD(s) used within the facility. “Key Pair” has the same meaning as Asymmetric Key Pair. “Local Registration Authority” and “LRA” means an optional part of a PKI that maintains users' identities from which CAs can issue digital certificates. “Plaintext Key” means an unenciphered cryptographic key or key component, which is used in its current form. “Private Key” means that key of an entity’s asymmetric key pair, which can only be used by that entity. In the case of an asymmetric signature system, the private key defines the signature transformation. Note: The term private key differentiates this key from the secret key of a symmetric algorithm. “Public Key” means that key of an entity’s asymmetric key pair which can be made public. In the case of an asymmetric signature system the public key defines the verification transformation. “Registration Authority” has the same meaning as Local Registration Authority. “RSA” means the name given to an algorithm for public-key cryptography. “Secret Key” means a cryptographic key used with a symmetric cryptographic algorithm that is uniquely associated with one or more entities and must not be made public. “Split Knowledge” means a condition under which two or more parties,

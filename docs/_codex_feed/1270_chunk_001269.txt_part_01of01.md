The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) was enacted by the United States (US) Congress in March 2010 to improve compliance with US tax laws. FATCA imposes certain due diligence and reporting obligations on foreign (non-US) financial institutions, including Australian institutions. These institutions will be required to report information on US citizens with financial accounts to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

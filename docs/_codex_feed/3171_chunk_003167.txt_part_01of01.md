Is the vendor’s solution or product secure? 1. Does the vendor’s solution/product securely capture and transmit payment card information? When a product or service is listed by PCI SSC or the payment card brands, it means that product/ service has been validated according to a PCI security standard. Inclusion on these listings is an indication that the vendor or service provider has taken extra steps to provide secure products or services. For solutions or products with payment terminals or payment applications: • Check here to see whether the payment terminal is PCI PTS approved: List of PCI Approved PTS Devices AND/OR • Check here to see whether the payment application is PCI PA-DSS validated: List of PCI PA-DSS of Validated Payment Applications OR • Check here to see whether the encryption solution is PCI P2PE validated: List of PCI P2PE Validated Solutions For card-not-present payment transactions (including e-commerce, mail order/telephone order): • Check here to see whether the service provider is a PCI DSS Compliant Service Provider: MasterCard’s List of Compliant Service Providers Visa’s Global Registry of Service Providers Visa Europe’s Registered Merchant Agents OR • Check here to see whether the payment application is PCI PA-DSS validated: List of PCI PA-DSS of Validated Payment Applications Note: If a vendor or solution provider does not provide you with positive answers to applicable questions in this table, you should strongly consider looking for another vendor or solution provider. 4 Data Security Essentials for Small Merchants: Questions to Ask Your Vendors | August 2018 Copyright 2018 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

Does the vendor’s product/solution store payment card information in my systems (for example, those in my store/shop locations, with my web application, or with my e-commerce website). If so, how does that product/solution protect the data? Products or solutions that tokenize or encrypt payment card information provide a way for merchants to secure card data. See the Guide to Safe Payments for more information about encryption and tokenization. 3. Does the vendor’s product/solution protect payment card data during transmission with strong encryption? Encryption converts information into a format that is unusable except to holders of a specific digital key. Securing payment card data in this way makes it less likely that it can be stolen and used fraudulently. For payment terminals & integrated payment terminals: • If you can, select from the List of PCI P2PE Validated Solutions for a product/solution in which card data is encrypted. Use of a PCI listed P2PE solution means payment card data is protected soon when you receive it and as it travels through your network and to your payment processor. For payment applications: • Check with your vendor, reseller, or integrator that the payment application is PCI PA-DSS validated. For hosted e-commerce websites, web applications or payment applications: • Ask your service provider whether they use a secure version of Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect transmissions of payment card data. 4. Is the vendor’s solution/product required to be integrated with my other systems—for example, with my payment terminals, accounts receivable, or other systems that contain cardholder data? A stand-alone or isolated payment terminal is simpler to secure than a more complex payment system that may have many connected systems. If the solution requires integration with other systems in your environment, consider the following: • Does it simplify your processing environment? • How does it add value to your business? • Do you need this type of solution? Consider that it will increase your business risk and complexity by making your cardholder data environment larger and harder to secure. You may want to consider another vendor or product unless there is a strong business requirement for having a more sophisticated solution with connections to your other systems. 5 Data Security Essentials for Small Merchants: Questions to Ask Your Vendors | August 2018 Copyright 2018 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved. Questions Ask: Analyzing Vendor Answers − Helpful Steps and Additional Information for Merchants Does the vendor help me securely install or set up the product or solution? 5. If the vendor is installing a payment application or system in my environment, ask: • Is the vendor a PCI Qualified Integrator or Reseller? • If the vendor does not install the payment application or system, are you expected to install it? QIRs are integrators and resellers specially trained by the Council to address critical security controls while installing merchant payment systems. QIRs reduce merchant risk and mitigate the most common causes of payment data breaches by focusing on critical security controls. Check here to see whether the vendor is listed: List of PCI QIRs. 6. Regardless of whether the vendor is a QIR, if the vendor is installing a payment application or system, ask: • Does the vendor support me during installation and ensure installation is done securely? • Does the vendor provide an implementation guide to help me set up the application securely? Improper installation can make your system vulnerable to compromise. The vendor should either install the application or system in a secure manner or help you by providing you with implementation guidance. The implementation should cover, at a minimum, how to change default passwords and establish strong ones, how to manage patches and updates, and a description of

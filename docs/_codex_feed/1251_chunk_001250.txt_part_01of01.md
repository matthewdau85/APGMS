More information about these issues is available in the 2018 CbC Reporting Package, located on the sbr.gov.au Significant global entity obligations (SGEO) page. 26 June 2018 The 2018 CbC Reporting Package has been updated to include sample messages based on the 2018 Local File / Master File (LCMSF) schema. The package is located on the sbr.gov.au Significant global entity obligation(SGEO) page. The 2018 LCMSF service has been deployed into the External Vendor Testing Environment (EVTE) for Bulk Data Exchange (BDE) and SBR . Conformance suites are available via the SBR Share File (login required). 5 June 2018 The Significant global entity obligations (SGEO) page on sbr.gov.au has been updated with technical documentation relating to the 2018 Local File / Master File (LCMSF) service. The update relates to changes to the form validation rules. 18 May 2018 Updated technical documentation relating to the 2018 Local File / Master File (LCMSF) service is now available via the Significant global entity obligations(SGEO) page on sbr.gov.au. 24 April 2018 The significant global entity obligations (SGEO) page on sbr.gov.au has been updated with technical documentation relating to the 2018 Local File / Master File (LCMSF) service. The documentation includes the following initial draft documentation: Message Structure Table (MST) XML Schema (XSD) Validation Rules The XML schema has been generated using the latest ATO XML schema generation algorithm. For more information, refer to the ATO XML Schema Generation Algorithm (DOCX, 276KB) document on sbr.gov.au. The 2018 service must be used for reporting periods starting on or after 1 January 2017. For the lodgments relating to earlier periods, you may use either the 2017 or 2018 service. The 2017 service cannot be used to lodge statements relating to reporting periods starting on or after 1 January 2017. We anticipate the publication of the conformance suite and EVTE deployment will occur on 21 June 2018, with production deployment on 13 July 2018. You can email any feedback or questions on the XML schema to the Cbc reporting mailbox . Administrative Solution - Extended Time to Lodge Given the EVTE will not be available until 21 June 2018, we are providing entities choosing to take up the administrative solution with additional time to lodge Part A of their Local file The income tax return and relevant sections of the IDS must still be lodged by 16 July 2018, or the relevant due date. However, Part A of the Local file can be lodged up until 14 September 2018. Part A of the Local file must be received by 14 September 2018, to qualify for the administrative solution. 15 February 2018 The external vendor testing environment (EVTE) has been updated to allow testing of submissions using the CbC report XML schema v1.0.1 for both bulk data exchange (BDE) and SBR . Please see the significant global entity obligations (SGEO) page on sbr.gov.au for more information. 18 December 2017 Wrapper header All CbC files must contain the appropriate wrapper header for lodgment via Bulk Data Exchange (BDE) and Standard Business Reporting (SBR) channels. Wrapper header guidance is available for both BDE and SBR . Testing Testing for both BDE and SBR is available via the External Vendor Testing Environment (EVTE). 14 July 2017 The final versions (v1.0) of technical documentation for the CbC report and Local File / Master File (LCMSF) service for 2017 are now available via the Significant global entity obligations (SGEO) page on sbr.gov.au. The CbC reporting service has now deployed to production for both bulk data exchange (BDE) and SBR. CbC report The OECD has released the final XML schema for the standardised exchange of CbC reports between jurisdictions. We are adopting the OECD XML schema for the purpose of domestic lodgment of the CbC report. Links and documents Contact information Feedback can be sent to CbCReporting@ato.gov.au .

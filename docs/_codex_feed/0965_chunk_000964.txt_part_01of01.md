were obviously difficulties, you know. There were events that went badly or decisions that went badly. And that was the bit that was more of a struggle, sort of taking that responsibility on your shoulders. But I enjoyed those aspects. I also enjoyed, you know, no job was the same. It was never a nine to five day. There was always a different challenge, always a slightly different environment. And so, yeah, I enjoyed the not routineness of it. I enjoyed the sort of everyday being a little bit different. Alicia Malone: So, in our world, in the payment security industry or in cybersecurity, we talk a lot about identifying and analyzing risk to reduce damage from threats. F1 analysts in a way seem to follow a similar principle, studying the huge amounts of data you collect to make decisions that have an impact on a race. Can you walk us through how your role helps achieve that goal? Bernie Collins: Yeah, so I think there are lots of similarities between F1 and many, many other industries, I think it must be said. But when we look at strategy on the pit wall, we think about when we're going to do a pit stop, what tires we might fit. So, the default plan, the Plan A, is actually reasonably easy to organize because it's just the best race to the end, the quickest race to the end, the checkered flag. Whereas, actually, what makes good strategy and the teams that achieve the most and get the best results from the race, they're actually teams that react the best to what goes on around them. So, the external events, the safety cars, the weather changes, the accidents, all of these things. And it's those external events and how we react to them that get the best result in the way it does for many, many other industries. But a lot of what we do in order to get there, to have the best reaction is really prepare using historical data. And we run the sort of concept that if we've come across an issue ever before, then we should have a plan for it. We should have a method of reacting to it. And a lot of that involves going back through historical data, looking at the likelihood of something happening like, for example, the likelihood of a safety car, and then get ready to manage that, to manage that developing situation. So, a lot of the lap-by-lap decisions, the very quick decisions that we made, a lot of those are made a little bit easier by having planned or prepared for the likelihood that that might happen. Alicia Malone: It sounds like there are many variables to consider in analyzing that data. One other thing in the payments industry, and in all industries really, that is becoming more prevalent is the use of AI. AI is really shaking things up across industries, including summarizing big data, like what we just talked about. When it comes to F1, how is artificial intelligence helping us predict a race outcome more accurately than before? Are there any exciting examples of AI making a tangible difference in race preparedness? Bernie Collins: Yeah, so I think AI is a growing brand of industry. It's a growing technique across many industries, like you say. And I think that it's been in use in F1 for a long time. The most common use, or the first use, was really to optimize car setup. But from a strategy use, it's growing all the time. We've been collecting a lot of data in F1, historical data. And up until recently, we've not really had the capability to correctly filter or sort through that data very quickly. And that's one of the areas that AI is really helping us, where we have collected all this historical data for a very long time and not necessarily been able to dig into it and use it. So, for example, for any event, we can look at when the last time that session was wet or at a certain track temperature or certain wind conditions. And all that data existed before. It's just now we have a real easy way of digging into it and finding the right answer quickly and that empowers us to make those fast-paced decisions. From a strategy side, we've been using a lot of machine learning in order to run, we run hundreds of thousands of simulations generally in the evening before the next day on a circuit. So, we collect some data during the day about our tire model or whatever it is that we're trying to answer. And then that evening we run those machine-learning models with all of the inputs that we've collected through the day in order to try and foresee what the race might look like, to have a lot of variability in strategies that others might try to do, in pit stop windows, in how the tires might change. So, we run, you know, this magnitude of simulations in order to hone in on what we believe is the right answer, the most likely way the race will go. That happens quite regularly on a Friday or Saturday night when the race is due to take place on Sunday morning. We're now at a point where teams can continue to run those models through

after the end of a Quarter that impact transactions reported on in the Quarter’s Merchant Breach Report, the Merchant referenced in that Quarter’s Merchant Breach Report no longer exceeds the Merchant Fraud Threshold in that Quarter: (i) within 90 days of the Reporting Date of that quarter the Acquirer may inform AusPayNet in writing of the adjustment to the Merchant’s Fraud Rate and resubmit its Merchant Breach Report for that Quarter; and (ii) if the Acquirer resubmits its Merchant Breach Report: AusPayNet will acknowledge receipt in writing within 14 days and confirm to the Acquirer that the Merchant is no longer in breach and is no longer required to take the measures to reduce its Merchant Fraud Rate previously advised; and if the Acquirer has been advised of an imminent referral to the Sanctions Tribunal for breach of the Threshold Requirement, AusPayNet will confirm in writing that the process of referral to the Sanctions Tribunal is discontinued. Note: If as a result of activities that occur after the end of a Quarter that impact transactions reported on in that Quarter’s Merchant Breach Report, there is a substantial reduction in the amount by which the Acquirer’s Merchant exceeds the Merchant Fraud Threshold in that Quarter, the Acquirer: (a) may inform the Company in writing; and (b) whether or not the Acquirer informs the Company, the Acquirer may reference the reduction if the Acquirer is ultimately referred to the Sanctions Tribunal for breach of the Threshold Requirement.

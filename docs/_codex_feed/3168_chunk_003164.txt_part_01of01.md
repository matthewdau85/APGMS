consider using a PCI DSS complaint service provider to help you securely process your e-commerce payment transactions, and/or to manage your e-commerce website. LOOK FOR PCI DSS COMPLIANT SERVICE PROVIDERS. Make sure your payment service provider is compliant with PCI DSS. Check Mastercard’s and Visa’s lists to confirm th t they are listed: MasterCard’s List of Compliant Service Providers Visa’s Global Registry of Service Providers Visa Europe’s Registered Agents REFER TO THIS LIST OF VENDOR QUESTIONS. Use Questions to ask your Vendors to help you know what to ask your vendors and service providers. Cost Ease Risk Mitigation Your customers enter their personal identific tion numbers (PINs) for their payment cards into your payment terminal or PIN entry device. It is important to use secure devices to protect your customers’ PIN data. A sure way to better protect your business is to use secure payment solutions and trained professionals to help you. Here’s how to choose safe products and make sure they are set up securely. For PCI payment terminals and secure card readers that encrypt card data, see page 24. 22 Data Security Essentials for Small Merchants: Guide to Safe Payments Copyright 2024 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved. Protect your business from the Internet ISOLATE USAGE. Don’t use the device or system you take payments with for anything else. For example, don’t surf the web or check emails or social media from the same device or computer that you use for payment transactions. When necessary for business (for example, updating your business’s social media page), use another computer and not your payment device for these updates. PROTECT YOUR “VIRTUAL TERMINAL.” If you enter customer payments via a virtual terminal (a web page you access with a computer or a tablet), minimize your risk - don’t attach an external card reader to it. PROTECT WI-FI. If your shop offers free Wi-Fi for your customers, make sure you use another network for your payment system (this is called “network segmentation”). Ask your network installer for help with safely configuring Wi-Fi. USE A FIREWALL. A properly configu ed fi ewall acts as a buffer to keep hackers and malicious software from getting access to your payment systems, your e-commerce website, and/or your card data. Check with your payment terminal vendor or service provider to make sure you have one and ask them for help configuring it correctly. USE PERSONAL FIREWALL SOFTWARE OR EQUIVALENT when payment systems are not protected by your business fi ewall (for example, when connected to public Wi-Fi). Cost Ease Risk Mitigation The Internet is the main highway used by data thieves to attack and steal your customers’ card data. For this reason, if your business is on the Internet, anything you use for card payments needs extra protection. A firewall is equipment or software that sits between your payment system and the Internet. It acts as a barrier to keep traffic out of your network and systems that you don’t want and didn’t authorize. Firewalls are configured (in hardware, software, or both) with specific criteria to block or prevent unauthorized access to a network. Firewalls are often included in the router “box” provided by your Internet provider. For simple tips on configuring your fi ewall, see PCI Firewall Basics 23 Data Security Essentials for Small Merchants: Guide to Safe Payments Copyright 2024 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

You should encrypt all card data you store or send. Make sure your payment system is using encryption and/or tokenization technology. If you are not sure, ask them. USE PCI DEVICES THAT ENCRYPT CARD DATA. The PCI Council approves payment terminals that protect PIN data and payment terminals and “secure card readers” that additionally encrypt card data. See the List of PCI Approved PTS Devices. USE SECURE PCI ENCRYPTION SOLUTIONS. Ask whether your payment terminal encryption is done via a Point-to-Point Encryption solution and is on the PCI Council’s List of PCI P2PE Validated Solutions. ARE YOU A MERCHANT NOW MOVING TO EMV CHIP TERMINALS? This is a great opportunity to make an investment in a terminal that supports EMV and also provides the added security of encryption and tokenization. UPGRADE YOUR SOLUTION. Reduce your risk – consider getting a new payment terminal that uses both encryption and tokenization technology to remove the value of card data for hackers. ASK. See Questions to ask your Vendors for help with questions to ask your vendor or service provider. SEE PAGE 22 PCI-approved secure card readers and payment terminals that encrypt card data do it using technology called “Secure Reading and Exchange of Data (SRED)” - ask your vendor if your payment terminal encrypts card data with SRED. E-commerce websites must encrypt card data that is sent over the Internet, for example, using something called transport-layer security (TLS). Ask your service provider how they encrypt your card data. Your data is vulnerable when it travels to your merchant bank, and when it’s kept or stored on your computers and devices. The best way to keep it safe is to make it useless even if it’s stolen by encrypting it whenever you store it or send it, and removing it altogether when it’s not needed. While this can be more complex to put in place, in the

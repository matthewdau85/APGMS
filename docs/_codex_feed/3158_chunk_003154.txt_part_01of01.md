Network * Two or more computers connected via physical or wireless means. Operating System * Software on a computer system that provides overall management and coordination of computer activities. Examples include Microsoft Windows, Apple OSX, iOS, Android, Linux, and UNIX. P2PE Acronym for the PCI Security Standards Council’s Point-to-Point-Encryption standard.

Depending on specific merchant bank and/or payment brand requirements, validation can be achieved through the applicable PCI DSS Self-Assessment Questionnaire or by a Report on Compliance resulting from an onsite assessment.

PCI-Approved Payment Terminal Payment terminal that has been approved per the PCI PIN Transaction Security (PTS) standard and is listed on the PCI Council website.

CEO’s Corner I recently spent time at Pay360 , the UK’s premier payments event. I was invited by The Payments Association’s Director General, Tony Craddock to discuss two topics: Australia’s Strategic Plan for Payments and Australia’s approach to scams. A Strategic Plan for Payments The UK’s interest in Australia’s Strategic Plan for Payments originates in their Future of Payments Review , published late last year by the UK Government and authored by Joe Garner, former Head of HSBC UK and CEO of Nationwide Building Society. There are many similarities between the ‘Garner’ Review and our own 'Farrell' Review in 2021, one of which is the call for what Garner terms a “ National Payments Vision ” – to be published later in 2024 – which is analogous to our Strategic Plan for Payments, published in June 2023. Similar to Australia’s Plan, the UK’s intended Vision will start with Government’s policy objectives for payments; what the Garner review terms “ its future desired outcomes for UK payments ”. It also aims to solve the same key issue as our Strategic Plan, in the same way: by prioritising a “ roadmap [that] is congested with multiple major initiatives ”, and “ simplifying the landscape ”, through “ an overriding vision and strategy … led [by] … Treasury ”. It remains to be seen whether the UK’s National Payments Vision will include the same level of detail as Australia’s Strategic Plan, but it is a must-watch as an international comparator, akin to the recent announcement of an Australian financial sector regulatory grid demonstrating Australia deliberately learning from the UK (and their equivalent grid ). Scams As in Australia, scams remain a prominent issue in the UK. Interestingly there, the introduction of the contingent reimbursement mechanism has not seen a reduction in scams. Data from UK Finance shows that for the first half of 2023, there was only a 1 percent dip in scam losses, with losses still up 27 percent from 2020. Indeed, there is a view in the UK that the reimbursement model is part of the problem rather than the solution, in that it: risks adding moral hazard to consumers guarantees the criminal’s revenue given only financial institutions contribute to reimbursement, the model does not incentivise participants in the scams lifecycle other than financial institutions, a particular problem when between 66 percent and 80 percent of scams are estimated to originate on Meta platforms. What is beyond doubt is that, unfortunately, the reimbursement model: has created a new type of scam, the “reimbursement” scam, where criminals pretend to have been scammed in order to be reimbursed is causing significant concerns in the UK fintech community, given it becomes mandatory for sending and receiving institutions in October 2024, up to a maximum of £415,000 per scam, which could be financially catastrophic for early-stage innovators. In contrast, Australia’s approach to scams seeks to incentivise all participants in the scams lifecycle to meet their obligations to stop scams. Our National Anti-Scam Centre (NASC), established in the middle of last year, does that through its Advisory Board – on which I have the great honour of sitting – Fusion Cells and Working Groups involving all of those participants: financial institutions, other payment service providers (PSPs), digital communication platforms (DCPs), telcos and internet service providers (ISPs), digital currency exchanges (DCEs), consumers, and law enforcement. Involving all of those participants gives Australia the opportunity to stop scams at source. We are already seeing some positive indicators of that happening: we have seen a 29 percent year-on-year reduction in scams in the last six months, with major contributory factors being bank-imposed friction on high risk transactions (e.g. to less reputable DCEs), the takedown of malicious investment scam websites by ASIC (nearly 3,500 in the second half of 2023), the development of an SMS Sender ID registry, telecommunications blocking, banks targeting mule accounts, and law enforcement action against the crime we call scams. Further incentivisation of the participants in the scams lifecycle will be provided in the form of new mandatory industry codes, setting out the scam-related obligations of those participants and the penalties that apply for non-compliance; draft legislation is expected in the second half of 2024. Some of those obligations will be common across all participants, for example, in data-sharing across the ecosystem and some specific to each sector, starting with banks, telcos, and DCPs and – we expect – extending to ISPs and PSPs. Such cross-sectoral obligations and penalties appear to have much more of an opportunity of stopping scams at source than the – structurally reactive – reimbursement model used in the UK. Nonetheless, the opportunity here is to learn from the best of breed internationally: Australia will be watching the UK – and countries like Singapore and Malaysia (which have both banned SMS with links) – in the same way that increasingly they are looking to Australia for best practice. My travels to the UK coincided with the Global Fraud Summit, where a number of countries including Australia signed a four-part communique to tackle scams. This is an important step in building international collaboration, to identify and pursue the criminal syndicates behind the scams and to repatriate funds. Ultimately scams are a crime, and a multinational one at that. In preventing that crime, we truly are better together. top Update on payments reforms In the last Payments Monitor , CEO Andy White outlined three major Government

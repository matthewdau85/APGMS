Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals 23 4. SUPPORTING MATERIAL AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION ➜ The growing prevalence of touchscreens The first touchscreen was believed to be developed in the 1960s and the technology continued evolving rapidly as screens became more receptive to touch and gestures. Today, this market is continuing to grow and offers opportunities for innovation as the touchscreens increase in quality and decrease in cost. To this end, touchscreen displays are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in daily life and can be found in a wide range of use from shopping mall directories, to the control of home appliances such as washing machines and fridges. Feedback received from the disability community during the consultation process was that accessible touchscreen technology, for many people, has given them a multitude of new ways through which to access the world. For example, some mobile phone and tablet manufacturers have built accessibility features such as text to speech or the ability to magnify the screen size into their operating systems, enhancing the ability of people with disability to use apps on their smart phones or tablets. Designing payment systems using touchscreens for accessibility and inclusion is critical, so as not to exclude a large portion of users from being able to access the world and live their lives independently. This is an important consideration for banking and payments organisations – to realise the innovation benefits offered through new technology while creating solutions that allow equality and access for everyone.

Accessibility and the procurement of services The Australian Standard AS EN 301.549:2016 ‘Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of technology products and services’ specifies a broad range of accessibility requirements applicable to technology products and services in the provision of government services (such as software, hardware and other form of technology which people may interact with). It is identical with, and has been reproduced from, the European standard EN 301 549 V1.1.2. Its recommended practices may be referenced for the sourcing of touchscreen payment technology (outside of government services) as a documented approach for embedding accessibility within procurement. International frameworks Internationally, Australia is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, designed to protect the rights and dignity of people with disabilities. Parties to the Convention are required to promote, protect, and ensure the full enjoyment of human rights by people with disabilities and ensure that they enjoy full equality under the law.

A number of Australian banks are also signatories to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for business which includes supporting ten goals including the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights, including those of people with disability.

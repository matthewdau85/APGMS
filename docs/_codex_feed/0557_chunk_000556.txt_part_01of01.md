It is critically important that safe, sound and secure practices be adopted for the generation, handling, transport, storage and installation of interchange Key Encrypting Keys. (b) The initial establishment of Key Encrypting Keys must employ one of the methods identified in this clause namely: (i) AS 2805.6.6 method; (ii) Native RSA key method; (iii) KTK method; (iv) KEK Component method. (c) For those members employing AusPayNet standard Security Control Modules where RSA functionality exists, the Native RSA initialisation method is preferred. 4.6.2 AS 2805.6.6 method (a) This Interchange key initialisation process employs an RSA key pair generated internally by the Security Control Module (SCM). (b) With this method each SCM has a set of pre-generated RSA key pairs. (c) The key exchange procedure is the following: (i) partners exchange (via a secure channel31) their public RSA keys (IPK) and the associated verification codes; (ii) each partner authenticates and installs the partner’s IPK; (iii) Key management proceeds in accordance with the requirements of AS 2805.6.6. 31 In the absence of a secure email channel, authenticity of public keys should be achieved by some other means, for example by verifying the corresponding PVC-s through a different communication channel, such as telephone or facsimile IAC CODE SET VOLUME 4 - DEVICE REQUIREMENTS AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT PART 4 CRYPTOGRAPHIC STANDARDS AND KEY MANAGEMENT Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 13 (d) Advantages This method is the only mechanism providing for full automation of subsequent key changes and for that reason is preferred. (e) Disadvantages This method may require changes to the application if it is to be supported. 4.6.3 Native RSA key method (a) This Interchange key initialisation process employs a RSA key pair generated internally by the Security Control Module (SCM). (b) With this method each SCM has a set of pre-generated RSA key pairs. (c) When generated on request, the Interchange Key Encrypting Key (KEKs) is signed by the native private key32 and encrypted by the partner’s public key. In this signed and encrypted format, the Interchange KEKs will be sent to the partner where it will be translated into the form required by the application (that is by encryption under the KM). For the receiving partner it will become KEK Receive. (d) The key exchange procedure is the following: (i) Partners exchange (via a secure channel33) their public RSA keys. This is a prerequisite to generate KEKs. The format of the data for the exchange of the public key uses three lines of text: (A) the public key modulus; (B) the public key exponent; and (C) the public key verification code (PVC). Note that the ASCII hex presentation of data applies. (e) The PVC will be mutually confirmed over the telephone by the key exchange representatives: (i) Each partner generates their KEK Send, that is cryptographically protected under RSA; 32 Actually the hash of the key is signed. 33 In the absence of a secure email channel, authenticity of public keys should be achieved by some other means, for example by verifying the corresponding PVC-s through a different communication channel, such as telephone or facsimile. IAC CODE SET VOLUME 4 - DEVICE REQUIREMENTS AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT PART 4 CRYPTOGRAPHIC STANDARDS AND KEY MANAGEMENT Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 14 (ii) Each partner submits the protected KEK Send to the Interchange partner (typically by secure email). The format of the data for the exchange of the KEK uses three lines of text: (A) the signed hash; (B) the encrypted KEK; and (C) the key verification code (KVC). Note that the ASCII hex presentation of data applies. (f) The KVC will be mutually confirmed over the telephone by the key exchange representatives. (i) the received KEK becomes KEK Receive. KEK Receive is translated from encryption/signing under RSA(s) to encryption under KM for local key database storage; (ii) both KEK Send and KEK Receive are stored in the required location in the key database; ensuring that the corresponding KEK KVC matches on both sides; (iii) the interchange is started using the new Interchange KEK keys. (g) The corresponding SCM functions are: C500 GETPUBLIC, C600 NODEKEKSEND, C610 NODEKEKREC. (h) Advantages (i) This method does not require any specific update/integration on the application part. i.e., the use of RSA is completely transparent to the application and therefore all Interchange parties can exchange keys through this method without any proprietary changes to their native application (as long as they have the required functions in their SCM). (ii) There is significant current experience with this method more so than with the other two random KEK methods - this method has proved to be very efficient and

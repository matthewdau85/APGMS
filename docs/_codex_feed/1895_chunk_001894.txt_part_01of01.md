The NPP October 2022 Roadmap has been published. An update on the NPP roadmap is now available providing the latest numbers relating to the growing use of the NPP. There are now close to 89 million accounts able to make or receive NPP payments and the platform now processes more than 100 million transactions a month. One in three of all account-to-account credit transfers are occurring via the NPP. There are close to 13 million registered PayIDs, a 44 per cent increase since the same time last year with 315,000 new PayID registrations on average being added every month. Usage of PayID is growing with research conducted by NPP Australia revealing that 47% of users using PayID at least weekly. The roadmap contains the latest status of the platform’s planned capability development, namely the delivery of the PayTo service in 2022 and preparing for the International Payment business service in 2023. PayTo, a new, digital way for businesses to initiate real-time payments from customers’ bank accounts, commenced rolling out from mid 2022. More than thirty organisations are now live with the service including third parties offering PayTo payment initiation services. The industry expects that the majority of NPP reachable accounts will be enabled for PayTo by mid 2023. The roadmap also highlights the areas of focus required for ensuring interoperability between the Consumer Data Right (CDR) and PayTo as work continues to expand the CDR framework to include payment initiation. The Roadmap provides an update on preparations for delivering inbound international payments on the NPP by the end of 2023 for NPP Participants and April 2024 for those organisations connecting indirectly to the platform. The ability to flag a payment as a cross-border transaction and include data such as the full legal account name of the sender and identifiers such as date of birth means the NPP will support faster cross-border payments as well as be more effective in addressing financial crime. Preparations also continue for the processing of bulk payments on the NPP and the migration of existing Direct Entry transactions over to the NPP, in anticipation of the likely retirement of the legacy system at some stage in the future. A number of financial institutions have begun piloting processing corporate bulk payments across the NPP, including via API driven payment solutions. All NPP participants are required to uplift their processing capacity in preparation for the ongoing migration of Direct Entry payments to the NPP by December 2023. Read the latest Roadmap here.

via another NPP access point) • Customer facilities that participating financial institutions must provide to support payer customers to: - authorise PayTo agreements - view their PayTo agreements - give instructions to make permitted amendments, pause, resume and cancel PayTo agreements • Recovery processes for payments made in error and mistaken payments • The liability framework associated with unauthorised payment initiation requests • Participation rules and criteria for different parties accessing PayTo (including new access options not currently available for NPP credit or “push” payments) PayTo is governed by an overarching rules framework established by NPP Australia which defines, amongst other things: The PayTo service leverages existing features and protections operating within the NPP today, specifically the use of PayID, security and authentication protocols, fraud prevention, liability allocation and risk management processes. In particular, PayTo further builds upon existing fraud controls and fraud prevention processes, simplifying the management of issues concerning fraud and unauthorised payments. 11 | PayTo Service Overview v2.0 Third parties that want to use PayTo to initiate payments via the NPP have a range of access options, including options for indirect or direct connectivity. Access Options Options at a glance: 1. A PayTo User is sponsored by either an NPP Participant or an Identified Institution 2. An Identified Institution is sponsored by an NPP Participant and can sponsor PayTo Users (if authorised to do so by their sponsoring NPP Participant) 3. A Connected Institution connects directly to the NPP infrastructure by installing an NPP payment access gateway, or PAG, in its own environment. It does not need to be an ADI but must meet certain technical and security requirements 4. A client of a Connected Institution can also request payments associated with PayTo agreements to which it is a party NPP Participants and Connected Institutions can interact directly with the Mandate Management Service via their NPP payment access gateway to create and manage PayTo agreements. All other entities interact with the MMS indirectly via either an NPP Participant or an NPP Connected Institution. More information regarding NPP access options and requirements is available here.

It removes the need for fintechs or other third parties wanting to initiate payments to have to integrate with multiple financial institutions to initiate payments from customers’ accounts – or the need to use intermediaries. Summary of requirements for each access option Indirect access options do not require accreditation under the NPP access framework. These four options are further explained on the following pages. Third parties that want to initiate payments only require one access point to the NPP infrastructure. This one access point enables them to initiate payments, with the customer’s authorisation, from any account that is enabled to make NPP payments. 13 | PayTo Service Overview v2.0 i. PayTo User PayTo Users are sponsored by either an NPP Participant or an Identified Institution. This could be, but is not limited to, the financial institution that it holds its bank account with. The terms under which a PayTo User is sponsored are subject to proprietary commercial arrangements between the sponsoring financial institution and the PayTo User. Examples of PayTo Users include: • A creditor, such as a merchant or biller, offering PayTo as a payment option to its customers • A payment service provider providing merchants with PayTo as a payment option • A third party or cloud accounting software provider managing outsourced business services such as payroll or accounts payable leveraging PayTo to be able to initiate payments from its customers’ accounts PayTo Users gain access to PayTo services through a proprietary channel or service (such as APIs) provided by their sponsor. Identified Institutions connect indirectly to the NPP via a sponsoring NPP Participant. A commercial arrangement is required between the NPP Participant and the Identified Institution. Being an ADI is not one of the eligibility requirements. Examples of Identified Institutions may include: • Credit unions and building societies • Non-ADI payment service providers and fintechs ii.

A Connected Institution can send payment initiation requests and is not involved in the clearing and settling of payments. Any organisation who can meet the NPP technical connectivity and security requirements along with other applicable criteria, is legally authorised to operate in Australia, and is financially solvent could apply to become an NPP Connected Institution1. Connected Institutions must also comply with the obligations and rules relating to accessing and using the Mandate Management Service (MMS) and the payment

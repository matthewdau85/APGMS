outlines each party’s responsibilities in this matter, which agreement must be consistent with and comply with the disclosure requirements specified in the QSA Agreement. Even if the actual, documented evidence is to be retained by the Customer, the QSA Company must still keep records to identify the specific evidence that was used during the PCI DSS Assessment—for example, digital and/or hard copies of the documents or testing results that are being retained by the Customer. The QSA Company’s records should clearly identify which pieces of evidence were used for each requirement, how the evidence was validated, and the findings that resulted from each piece of evidence. The QSA Company should retain enough Information to ensure that the complete, actual evidence used during the PCI DSS Assessment can be identified for retrieval if needed; for example, in the event of an investigation or if a finding needs to be reviewed. As part of the PCI SSC’s Assessor Quality Management (“AQM”) QSA Program audit process (“QSA Audit”) and in other AQM quality assurance (“QA”) review work as needed, it is common for AQM to request both the QSA Company’s Workpaper Retention Policy and a sample of PCI DSS Assessment workpapers. This is to ensure the QSA Company has a current documented, implemented Workpaper Retention process consistent with the requirements defined in the QSA Qualification Requirements—including appropriate level of detailed instructions for Assessor-Employees to comply with. AQM may additionally request blank and/or executed copies of the QSA Company’s Workpaper Retention Policy agreement that each Assessor-Employee is required to sign, and may request additional evidence to demonstrate that all Assessment Results and Related Materials (defined in the QSA Agreement) relating to the PCI DSS Assessments for the sampled ROC were in fact retained in accordance with the procedures defined in the Workpaper Retention Policy prior to releasing the final ROC for that PCI DSS Assessment. For details on what the QSA Company’s Evidence Retention Policy must include, please see Section 4.5 of the QSA Qualification Requirements document available on the Website.

Page 17 1052300.5 8 Assessor Quality Management Program The QSA Company must have implemented an internal quality assurance program as documented in its Quality Assurance Manual. As part of QSA Audits, Assessor Quality Management (AQM) at PCI SSC performs a holistic review of the QSA Company’s internal documentation required by the QSA Qualification Requirements, as well as reviews of ROCs to provide reasonable assurance that the documentation of testing procedures performed is sufficient to demonstrate compliance. Refer to Appendix A to understand sample criteria against which QSA Companies are measured during QSA Audits. A QSA Audit by the PCI AQM team will result in a finding of:  Satisfactory – A notification letter will be sent with specific opportunities for improvement listed. Mandatory call with AQM team to discuss. A “Satisfactory” finding indicates that the audit findings reasonably confirmed (1) the QSA Company/Employee’s on-going adherence to the current QSA Qualification Requirements; (2) that the QSA Company’s quality policy documentation is implemented and maintained according to the QSA Qualification Requirements; and (3) the QSA Company/Employee’s on-going general adherence to reporting requirements as evidenced by sampled ROCs.  Needs Improvement – A notification letter will be sent with specific opportunities for improvement listed. Mandatory call with AQM team to discuss. A “Needs Improvement” finding indicates that there were minor findings and/or opportunities for improvement identified that assessors should address to ensure continued adherence with program documentation. Still, the audit findings reasonably confirmed (1) the QSA Company/Employee’s on-going adherence to the current QSA Qualification Requirements; (2) that the QSA Company’s quality policy documentation is implemented and maintained according to the QSA Qualification Requirements; and (3) the QSA Company/Employee’s on-going general adherence to reporting requirements as evidenced by sampled ROCs.  Unsatisfactory – A notification letter is sent with specific opportunities for improvement. Mandatory call with AQM team to discuss Remediation. An “Unsatisfactory” finding indicates that there were serious findings identified during the QSA Audit, including possible Violations to the QSA Agreement. This finding will result in Remediation and/or Revocation, per the current QSA Qualification Requirements. Audit findings that result in an Unsatisfactory finding mean that AQM could not confirm one or more of the following: (1) the QSA Company/Employee’s on-going adherence to the current QSA Qualification Requirements; (2) that the QSA Company’s quality policy documentation is implemented and maintained according to the QSA Qualification Requirements; and (3) the QSA Company/Employee’s on- going general adherence to reporting requirements as evidenced by sampled ROCs. In addition to reviewing the QSA Company’s Mentor Manual upon initial entry into the Associate QSA Program, AQM will perform spot audits for QSA Companies participating in the Associate QSA Program. Refer to Appendix B for information regarding criteria against which QSA Companies participating in the Associate QSA Program are measured. For further details on the Assessor Quality Management Program, please see the QSA Qualification Requirements document available on the Website.

Page 18 1052300.5 8.1 Ethics The QSA Company must adhere to professional and business ethics, perform its duties with objectivity, and limit sources of influence that might compromise its independent judgment in performing PCI SSC Assessments. PCI SSC has adopted a PCI SSC Code of Professional Responsibility (the “Code,” available on the Website)

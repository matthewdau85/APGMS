CEO’s corner Year in Review: FY25 As in previous years, the end of the financial year is a good time to review AusPayNet’s performance against our strategic goals. Transformation In leading the transformation of Australian payments to drive efficiency, innovation and choice: On cheques, Government announced the Cheques Transition Plan in November 2024, calling out AusPayNet for its leadership and coordination of the industry program of work to ensure a smooth transition. In July 2025, the ACCC granted us authorisation for this program of work. The Steering Committee and working groups have been established, have agreed on key exit milestones, and will collaborate to ensure a smooth transition. On BECS, we (with Australian Payments Plus (AP+)) have received the ACCC's final determination with conditons . There is a clear program of work to address the recommendations from the RBA’s risk assessment. The consultation on vision and work on the options analysis for BECS are both underway. On AES, a Migration Steering Committee has been established to direct the program going forward. The ACCC application for the migration has been lodged, with final determination expected in October. We successfully completed the ISO 20022 Migration Implementation Workstream and managed the end of domestic coexistence on time and on budget. A fourth phase of the Program has been approved, covering 2026 and 2027 maintenance cycles and transition to BAU. The COIN Migration was successfully completed in September 2024. Insights In terms of AusPayNet being the home for ecosystem collaboration and strategic insight: Our Economic Crime Forum is now positioned as the public-private partnership forum for the Serious and Organised Crime Coordination Committee. Also in the economic crime space, federal Parliament passed legislation introducing the Scams Prevention Framework in February 2025; next steps include the development of industry scam codes. Notable policy submissions were made to the RBA Review of Merchant Card Payment Costs and Surcharging, and the Scams Prevention Framework, which received strong positive feedback from our Policy Experts Group, Members and other key stakeholders. We continue to maintain strong relationships with Government (Commonwealth and State), RBA and other regulators. NSW and Victorian State Governments, the ATO and Services Australia now sit on our Stakeholder Advisory Council, which is focused on end-user insights and perspectives and which now also includes CHOICE. Our Emerging Technology Experts Group published an industry point-of-view on Artificial Intelligence in Payments in December 2024 and is currently developing an Insights Paper on agentic commerce. We took on leadership of the Industry Resilience Initiative (IRI) and established the IRI Steering Committee, with participation from Members, APRA and the RBA. The program has real momentum and has also led to the establishment of a new function at AusPayNet: Industry Resilience and Crisis Management. In the events space, our 2024 Summit was a massive success, with our biggest audience to date, while we also held our first in-person Member event in Brisbane. Standards AusPayNet’s work in setting and enforcing industry standards for a safe, reliable and effective payments system also progressed in FY25: We launched our e-Conveyancing Payments Industry Code in March. Our new Portability Standard was approved by the Board in May. The ATM Access Standard – which replaces the ATM Access Code – was approved by the Board in June. On the G20’s targets for cross-border payments, AusPayNet is now a member of key global taskforces and advisory groups.

In this first edition, you can read about the scope of the program, work currently underway and what lies ahead. Future quarterly issues will provide high-level updates on the program’s progress, as well as relevant developments in Australia and globally. Read the first edition on our website . You can also visit the project page on our website for updates on the program. Payment reforms Consultation on Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) Rules In June, AusPayNet responded to AFCA's consultation on proposed amendments to its Rules to expand AFCA's jurisdiction over receiving banks in scam complaints. AusPayNet's submission supported expanding AFCA's jurisdiction to include receiving banks and other entities involved in the scams lifecycle, noting that effective consumer protection requires all of these entities to have appropriate incentives and obligations to prevent, detect, disrupt and respond to scams. However, we expressed concerns about implementing these amendments ahead of the implementation of the recently legislated Scams Prevention Framework (SPF), and particularly the development of the SPF sectoral codes, rules and guidelines. Of particular concern was the absence of clear guidance on how responsibility and liability would be apportioned across multiple entities involved in a scam under the amended Rules, and insufficient clarity around the scope of entities captured under the proposed changes. AusPayNet recommended that AFCA consider delaying implementation of the Rules amendments until the SPF instruments are developed, or if proceeding immediately, provide clearer definitions of which entities are captured and commit to aligning the AFCA Rules with the SPF instruments once finalised. Portability Standard On 1 July, the 12-month transition period commenced for entities intending to adopt AusPayNet's Standard for Payment Service Provider Porting of Merchant Payment-Related Data (Standard) . The Standard details a common

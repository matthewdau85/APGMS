CEO’s Corner A Turning Point The end of the year is shaping up to be a busy and exciting one. On 12 December, we will be hosting our annual Summit, the premier event in Australian Payments. This year’s theme is ’A Turning Point’. This reflects what we have already witnessed in 2023: the Government releasing a Strategic Plan for Australia’s Payments System and progressing payments reform by consulting on licensing; Michele Bullock – who has significant experience in payments – being appointed as the Governor of the RBA; and the launch of the National Anti-Scam Centre (NASC). It also reflects what we’ll see before the end of the year, with significant Government consultations on licensing (part two), cheques and scams. I’ll briefly discuss those later. Together, all this activity through 2023 genuinely represents a turning point in payments. The AusPayNet Summit Now sold out, our Summit next month will be emceed by one of Australia’s best loved and experienced news presenters, Juanita Phillips. I’m also delighted to say that the Governor of the RBA, Michele Bullock, will give her first address on the topic of payments. Following Michele’s address, I’m fortunate to then host an incredibly well credentialled panel on scams, which will consist of: The Hon Stephen Jones, MP, Assistant Treasurer and Minister, Financial Services; Sarah Court, Deputy Chair, ASIC; and Catriona Lowe, Deputy Chair, ACCC. We will focus on regulation as an enabler in the critical fight against scams, and their continued threat to Australian consumers and businesses, including the role of the NASC and national anti-scam codes. Continuing the stellar line-up, I’ll then interview Nghi Luu, Division Head (acting), Financial Systems Division, Department of Treasury. Nghi and I will discuss the important topic of reforming Australia's regulatory architecture for payments, including the next steps in Government’s Strategic Plan for Australia’s Payments System , among them the second consultation on licensing. We’ll then dive into some fascinating panel sessions on the new frontiers in payments: AI, innovation, and digital currencies. The AI panel includes representatives from PCI and Endava, and will cover threats and opportunities from AI for security in payments. That will be followed by a panel looking at the innovation challenge in Australian payments, which will benefit from the experience of representatives from CBA, Monoova, Stripe, and Visa. And the digital currency payments panel will share insights across the entire spectrum of digital currencies: CBDC, stablecoin and cryptocurrency. Another panel will see representatives from Zepto, Westpac, and NSW Treasury consider how best to manage legacy payments systems and their decline, with key questions on cheques and BECS, including governments’ use of those systems. And our big debate this year is on whether Australia should be cashless. Given the topic, both sides of the debate will no doubt be well elucidated, and the debate will again be expertly moderated by Ellis Connolly, Head of Payments Policy at the RBA. Our post-Summit survey in 2022 saw consistent demand for more networking time. As a result, one of the enhancements to this year’s event is an extended two-hour networking function at the conclusion of the program. Overall, the 2023 Summit has an excellent agenda and affords a great opportunity to network. I look forward to seeing you there. I’d also like to thank our event partners: Thales, Transaction Network Services, Endava, MessageXchange, PAX Technology Australia, Swift, ACI Worldwide, Indue, Quest Payment Systems, ASL, Deloitte, and Upplft. End of Year Consultations But 2023, and the turning point in payments, doesn’t end there! Before the end of the year, we expect the second round of consultation on payments licensing, continuing progress on payments reform. We also expect consultations on both cheques and scams. The second consultation on payments licensing will focus on the obligations and rights associated with payments licenses and, as part of that, is likely to touch on standard-setting, including the role of authorised standard-setting bodies. The consultation on cheques will consider the future of cheque use in Australia, and the support required to retire the cheques system, including testing the dates outlines in the Strategic Plan for Australia’s Payments System (2028 for Government’s use of cheques; 2030 for the retirement of the cheques system). As part of this process, the Government will also consider the ongoing role of the Cheques Act 1986 . The consultation on scams will propose a framework and principles for obligations on, and consumer expectations of, the various actors in the scams lifecycle. This will be a precursor to further work on individual regulatory codes on banks, telecommunications companies, and social media platforms in 2024. All this important work means that the payments ecosystem really is at a turning point as we head towards the end of 2023. As always, I would like to acknowledge our Members, stakeholders, Commonwealth and State governments, regulators, and our staff for their collaboration and work over the course of the year. top Update on payments reforms Consultation on reforms to the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998 ( PSRA ) - exposure draft legislation In June 2023, Treasury consulted on proposed reforms to the PSRA that would ensure all entities that play a role in the payments ecosystem could be regulated, if there was a need to do so in the public or national interest. These changes are part of the Government’s broader payment system reform agenda under the Strategic Plan for Australia’s Payments System . Following the June consultation, Treasury

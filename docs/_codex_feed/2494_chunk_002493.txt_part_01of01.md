before such data is used for any other reason. Automatic Decision Making You have the right to request information about the logic involved in automatic decision making processes we use involving your Personal Information, and to request that you not be subject to such automated decision making. Exercising Your Personal Information Rights To exercise the rights described above, please submit a verifiable user request to us by contacting us as described under “Contact Information” below. Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable user request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable user request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable user request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable user request must: Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative. Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Making a verifiable user request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable user request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. Response Timing and Format We endeavor to respond to a verifiable user request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable user request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable user request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. Separate from the CCPA and CPRA, California’s Shine the Light law gives California residents the right to ask companies what Personal Information they share with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of directly marketing their goods or services to you unless you request such disclosure. Also, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers who are California residents and who have provided us with “personal information” (as that term is defined in Section 1798.83) to request certain information about the disclosure of that information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident with questions regarding the above, please contact us in the manner set forth under the heading “Contacting Us” in the Privacy Policy. Non-Discrimination We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your data rights. Unless permitted by law, we will not, as a result of your exercising any of these rights: Deny you goods or services. Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties. Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services. Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services. Changes to Our Privacy Notice We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Notice at our discretion at any time. When we make changes to this Privacy Notice, we will notify you through a notice on our website homepage, or by posting updated terms.

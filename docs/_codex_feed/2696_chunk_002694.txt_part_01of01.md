access, is securely maintained and not accessible to any unauthorized individual.  Provide awareness training annually for all personnel to understand the importance of physical security and keeping the workspace secure—for example, not to write passwords on sticky notes attached to the desktop—and define clear responsibilities for remote agents regarding physical security of all telephone equipment in their homes or remote locations.  If account data is ever written or printed on paper, ensure it is securely stored, then shredded when no longer needed. If any part of the telephone environment is outsourced to a third-party service provider, both the entity and service provider should clearly understand their responsibilities for securing their respective systems, processes, and personnel, and document accordingly. Where account data is input into systems:  Ensure and verify that the PAN is masked when displayed (the first six and last four digits are the maximum number of digits to be displayed), for personnel without a legitimate business reason to see the whole PAN.  The display of full PAN on items such as computer screens, payment card receipts, faxes, or paper reports can result in this data being obtained by unauthorized individuals and used fraudulently. Ensuring that the full PAN is only displayed for those with a legitimate business need to see the full PAN minimizes the risk of unauthorized persons gaining access to PAN data.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 21 5 Technology The PCI DSS is very clear on the requirements and controls necessary to keep technology secure, and the PCI SSC Prioritized Approach (document links available in Appendix G) helps stakeholders understand where and how they can act to reduce risk earlier in the validation process using a prioritized, milestone-based approach. For example, the first milestone is to remove sensitive authentication data and limit data retention. By limiting exposure of payment data in your systems, you simplify scope and validation, reducing the chance of being a target for criminals. 5.1 Risks and Guidance in Simple Telephone Environments Using desktops and other types of terminals introduces risks. To prevent unauthorized access to or diversion of account data from such devices, these technologies should be suitably secured and checked regularly for viruses or other malware as well as for signs of physical tampering—for example, the addition of a keyboard- logging device. Wherever possible, avoid solutions that expose personnel to CHD/SAD. Additionally, any customer database systems, third-party CRM applications, or order-processing systems into or through which account data is being processed, transmitted, or stored should be secured. Below, among other possible controls, examples of such controls include:  Ensure that at-home/remote workers use a multi-factor authentication process when connecting to the telephone environment or to any systems which process SAD/CHD.  For all personnel, prohibit unauthorized copying, moving, and storing of account data onto local hard drives and removable electronic media when accessing payment card data via remote-access technologies.  Ensure that the PAN, once entered into the system, is masked when displayed; no more than the first six and last four digits should be displayed. Note that individuals may view additional PAN digits when there is a legitimate business to do so—for example, if a supervisor needs to review the full details of a particular transaction. Any individuals not specifically authorized to view the full PAN should only ever have access to masked PANs.  Consider technology solutions (described later in this guidance) where personnel do not have to hear or enter account data into the system. For example, some technologies allow the cardholder to use their telephone keypad to enter account data into a secure webpage, either directly or via a secure link provided via SMS or e-mail, thus preventing the entity from being exposed to the cardholders’ account data.  Require all personnel to use only company-approved hardware devicese.g., mobile phones, telephone handsets, laptops, desktops, and systems. This is especially relevant to remote/at-home working, ensuring that the entity can maintain control of systems and technology supporting the processing of telephone-based payment card data.  Ensure that all desktop/terminals, including those in remote/at-home working environments: − Have personal firewalls installed and operational.

Potentially high volumes of payment card account data are received in clear and handled by staff. This data may be stored in audible format. Data will be transmitted and processed across various networks with service providers using telephony-specialized technologies, making the evaluation of the PCI DSS scope difficult. It is important to note that a system is considered “in scope” regardless of

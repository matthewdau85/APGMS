The New Payments Platform and Fast Settlement Service Alexandra Rush and Riaan Louw[*] Photo: Monsitj Abstract A significant advance in the Australian payments system occurred in February 2018 with the public launch of the New Payments Platform (NPP). The NPP enables customers of financial institutions to make immediate payments 24 hours a day, every day of the week (‘24/7’). In conjunction with the development of the NPP, the Reserve Bank developed new infrastructure, the Fast Settlement Service (FSS), which provides for settlement of NPP transactions between financial institutions on a 24/7 basis across their Exchange Settlement Accounts (ESAs) at the Reserve Bank. These new systems have brought fast payment services to Australians in line with similar initiatives that have been undertaken or are underway internationally. The initial adoption of the NPP has been gradual, reflecting the staged introduction of services by financial institutions, as well as the time taken for customers to assess and adjust to the new services being offered. RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA BULLETIN – SEPTEMBER 2018 1 Introduction Australians make around 50 million retail (typically low-value) payments per business day using cash, cheques, cards and the direct entry (DE) system (the latter includes direct debits and internet ‘pay anyone’ bank transfers). Obligations between financial institutions arising from cheque, card and DE payments settle on a deferred basis periodically throughout the day in aggregated batches in the Reserve Bank Information and Transfer System (RITS, Australia's real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system).[1] The time required for institutions to process these types of payments, and for settlement to occur, means that there is a delay in the funds being made available to the recipient. This can take between a few hours and a day in the case of DE transactions, and can be as long as a few days for cheques. Weekends and public holidays can extend these timeframes. In February 2018, the NPP – a new payment system infrastructure designed primarily for retail payments – was launched to the public. The NPP enables consumers, businesses and Australian government agencies to make fast, versatile and data-rich payments 24 hours per day, every day of the year. NPP payments are settled finally and irrevocably between authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) across accounts at the Reserve Bank in real time (that is, as they occur). This is made possible by the FSS, which was built by the Bank as a new service of RITS. The real-time settlement of NPP payments in central bank funds allows institutions to make funds available in recipients' accounts instantaneously without giving rise to settlement or credit risk. The NPP and FSS represent significant changes to the Australian payments system and are the result of a number of years of work by the payments industry and the Reserve Bank. This article sets out the background to the introduction of fast retail payments in Australia and the process of building the NPP and FSS. It explains the infrastructure and processes involved in making fast payments in Australia as well as the operating principles that enable quick settlement on a 24/7 basis. Finally, the article briefly explores some payment trends observed since the launch of the NPP and FSS. Background From 2010 to 2012 the Reserve Bank's Payments System Board (PSB) conducted a Strategic Review of Innovation in the Payments System, which concluded that there were a number of gaps in the provision of retail payments in Australia (RBA 2012a). To address the gaps, the PSB set out strategic objectives, including the ability to: • make real-time retail payments • send and receive low-value payments outside normal banking hours RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA BULLETIN – SEPTEMBER 2018 2 • send more complete remittance information with payments • address (i.e. nominate the payee of) payments in a relatively simple way. The PSB encouraged the payments industry to determine the best way of addressing the strategic objectives, and endorsed a set of Core Criteria as the framework for assessing any industry proposal (RBA 2012b). In response to the PSB's strategic objectives, the industry under the auspices of the Australian Payments Clearing Association (APCA, now the Australian Payments Network) formed the Real-Time Payments Committee, which in February 2013 finalised an industry proposal to deliver a fast payments solution for Australia (APCA 2013). This was followed by the establishment of NPP Australia Limited (NPPA), with 13 members (12 ADIs and the Reserve Bank) working together to develop and run the NPP as an industry utility. The strategic review by the PSB and introduction of the NPP in Australia occurred in the context of significant developments in fast retail payment systems internationally. The PSB foresaw that, in the absence of collaborative efforts by the payments industry, the retail payment services offered in Australia were at risk of falling behind those available in other countries (Richards 2014). Although in some countries – including Japan, Korea, Mexico and Switzerland – fast payment capabilities for retail payments have existed for years, more recently technological advancements have led to numerous countries further developing their services or launching faster retail payments systems (Bolt, Emery and Harrigan (2014) and CPMI (2016)). NPP and FSS projects The development of the NPP involved extensive cooperation between ADIs to build the capability to send and receive individual payment messages between themselves, as well as settlement instructions to the Reserve Bank's FSS, in real time. Additionally, the project required ADIs to upgrade their internal systems to allow posting to

the RBA will provide Participants with confirmation of their last known ESA balance prior to entering the HVCS Fallback Period. This may not be possible if the Disabling Event prevents the RBA from accessing this information, in which case, Participants must use their own internal records. 5.3.4 Payment Status Participants must use their internal system records to determine the status of payments sent prior to and during the HVCS Fallback Period. Note: As previously described, receipt of a MT012 or MT019 response from RITS indicates that a payment has been processed by RITS. Once the FIN-Copy Service has reopened in T-Copy mode, the absence of a MT012 or MT019 response from RITS indicates that a payment has bypassed RITS. For the avoidance of doubt, payments sent prior to the Disabling Event for which the Sender has received a MT012 or MT019 have been settled or rejected and their processing can be considered as complete. 5.4 During HVCS Fallback 5.4.1 Message Format Senders must continue to format MT103 and MT202 messages in accordance with the Message Preparation Guidelines set out in these Procedures. 472 MT096 messages will still be created and sent to the CSI as per Y-Copy, but will not be passed to RITS. 473 See RITS Member Contingency Procedures (available on the RITS Information Facility) for details. HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 145 5.4.2 Preventing Non-current Day Payments Participants must ensure that the methods they use for preventing future and back dated payments from being sent in T-Copy and for identifying future and back dated payments received in T-Copy are operating as expected. 5.4.3 Reversing Non-current Day Payments Senders must be responsible for rectifying any future or back dated payments mistakenly sent during the HVCS Fallback Period. 5.4.4 Cash Transfers Participants should send payments that would ordinarily be submitted to RITS through a Cash Transfer as a SWIFT payment, if required. 5.4.5 Projected ESA Balance Participants must use their internal system records to track their bilateral net settlement obligations and projected ESA balance during a HVCS Fallback Period. 5.5 Exiting HVCS Fallback 5.5.1 Approaching T-Copy Cut-Off Time The RBA will send a notification to Participants thirty minutes prior to the Cut-off Time instructing Participants to begin finalising payments. 5.5.2 T-Copy Cut-Off Time Participants must stop sending payments at the Cut-off Time. It is important that Participants do not continue to send payments after this time in order for each Participant to obtain their final bilateral net positions prior to compilation of the HVCS Exchange Summary Form. 5.5.3 SWIFT PDS Reversion AusPayNet or the RBA will instruct SWIFT to revert the SWIFT PDS FIN-Copy Service to Y- Copy mode. This may be lodged in advance of the Cut-off Time but will instruct SWIFT not to action the change any earlier than the Cut-off Time. The SWIFT timings and process for doing this are the same as for the switch to T-Copy performed earlier in the day. 5.5.4 Submit HVCS Exchange Summary Forms Participants must compile their HVCS Exchange Summary Form and submit it to the RBA via email within two hours of the Cut-off Time. Note: The RBA will consolidate and compare the HVCS Exchange Summary Form submitted by each Participant to generate a Provisional HVCS Exchange Figures Advice for each Participant. Where applicable, the HVCS Exchange Figures Advice will advise a Participant that the amount of a net bilateral obligation they have submitted fails to match the amount submitted by the other Participant (failure to match). HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 146 5.5.5 Agree Provisional HVCS Exchange Figures Advice Participants should provide the RBA with email confirmation that they agree to the Provisional HVCS Exchange Figures Advice provided by the RBA at the earliest possible opportunity and by no later than 30 minutes before commencement of the Morning Settlement Session (7am) on the day after the HVCS Fallback Period. Where the HVCS Exchange Figures Advice from the RBA has advised a Participant of a failure to match, the Participant must investigate this and if required, submit a revised HVCS Exchange Summary Form to the RBA before 7am on the day after the HVCS Fallback Period. Note: From 7am on the day after the HVCS Fallback Period, the RBA will generate and send a Final HVCS Exchange Figures Advice and Net Clearing System Obligations Advice showing a Participant’s multilateral net position in the contingency batch, including clearing interest. Where a failure to match remains unresolved, the RBA will apply Failure To Match rules and proceed with the contingency batch. 5.5.6 Failure To Match The RBA will apply Failure To Match rules in accordance with Clause 9.32(a) of these Procedures if two or more Participants cannot agree on the amount owing for a given obligation. 5.5.7 Reconciliation to RITS Participants should reconcile the internal record of payments (used to calculate their net bilateral obligations) to RITS when RITS recovers. Note: When RITS is recovered and the system date has rolled forward to the day after the HVCS Fallback Period, the SWIFT Feeder connection is restored. The backlog of HVCS settlement requests stored in the CSI will enter RITS and be rejected due to the back-dated value date. Participants can use the RITS UI

by a determined attacker, and merchants should ensure that they are appropriately addressing this risk. To that extent, SAQ A 3.2 was updated with additional requirements including changing default passwords (Requirement 2) and implementing some basic authentication requirements, such as requiring a unique user ID and strong password (Requirement 8). These requirements are intended to help protect merchant websites from compromise and maintain the integrity of the redirection mechanism. Additional information can be found in the PCI SSC FAQ knowledgebase found on the PCI SSC website document library. iFrames provide a degree of security by relying on a technique known as the same-origin policy, which is enforced by all modern web browsers. The assessor will need to verify the merchant is getting the protection expected. This prevents malicious scripts on the merchant’s website from interacting with the contents of the third-party content (i.e., the payment form) in the frame. This makes it more difficult for an attacker with control of the merchant’s website or other third-party content providers to silently monitor and steal cardholder data. If an attacker has compromised the merchant’s website, however, they can create alternative content for the frame, which then allows completion of the payment process as well as creation of a copy of the cardholder data for the attacker. Without monitoring and alerting controls on the merchant’s infrastructure, attacks of this nature might be impossible to detect. Merchants should consider complementing their PCI DSS compliance program with additional security controls to reduce e-commerce risk, even if such controls are not stated as required by SAQ A. Hardening of servers, vulnerability management, and monitoring of server activity are effective controls for these implementations. Merchants should also consider the use of additional layers of monitoring and defense provided by their PSP to promote additional security for the iFrame implementation. While not required under PCI DSS, it is recommended that PSPs provide configurable tools that detect and report suspicious transactions or unusual activity that may be indicators of compromised systems. While PCI DSS does not prescribe specific controls to monitor suspicious activity, it is a best practice for merchants to make use of PSP tools that are applicable to the merchant’s e-commerce implementation. Some of these methods are discussed in Section 2.11.2, “Payment Service Provider Best Practices to Detect Suspicious Activity.” Information Supplement • Best Practices for Securing E-commerce • April 2017 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

Payment card data is not collected, stored, processed, or transmitted by the merchant, so there are fewer systems that need security controls and lower risk of the merchant’s systems being compromised. This e-commerce option provides an easier way for merchants to provide security for cardholder data as most of the cardholder data security is performed by the PSP. However, as the PSP stores, processes, and transmits cardholder data on behalf of the merchant, it is strongly recommended that a merchant ensure the PSP is validated as a PCI DSS compliant service provider to protect the merchant’s cardholder data and enable an easier PCI DSS compliance route. Merchants using an iFrame e-commerce implementation may be eligible for PCI SAQ A, providing they meet the eligibility criteria of that SAQ. Merchants should consult with their acquirer (merchant bank) or with the payment brands directly to determine whether they are required to validate their PCI DSS compliance, and which reporting method they should use. The PCI SAQ A for PCI DSS v3.2 questionnaire currently includes as few as 22 requirements. 2.2.5 Recommendations The iFrame e-commerce method is usually easier for merchants to secure, and results in fewer applicable PCI DSS requirements and lower risk of merchant systems being compromised (although not as low as the redirect method). However, this method also offers a better customer payment experience, as the customer remains on the merchant website throughout. The inline payment form can provide a better “look and feel” than the redirect payment method as the payment page can be customized to match the website design. 2.3 The Direct Post Method (DPM) 2.3.1 What is a Direct Post? The Direct Post Method for e-commerce payment is generally used by larger merchants that require more control over their payment form “look and feel” and are able to understand and implement the extra PCI DSS security controls that are required to protect their systems. The Direct Post Method uses the merchant’s website to generate the shopping cart and payment web pages. The merchant’s payment form, loaded in the customer’s browser, sends the cardholder data directly to the PSP—not via the merchant’s website or systems—ensuring cardholder data is not stored, processed, or transmitted via the merchant systems. However, the payment form is provided by the merchant; therefore, the merchant’s systems are in scope for additional PCI DSS controls, which are necessary to protect the merchant website against malicious individuals changing the form and capturing cardholder data.

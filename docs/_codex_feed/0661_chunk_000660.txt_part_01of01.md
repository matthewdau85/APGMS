Where connected via TCP/IP they must be on a separate, stand-alone network; there must be no uncontrolled connections between general internal and external networks and Terminal/SCM networks (assuming they are all TCP/IP); the host environment must provide, at a minimum, an IPS or IDS between the perimeter network firewall and acquiring host; the host system must support appropriate threat management techniques relevant to the host’s operating platform, such as malware protection with up to date signatures and maintenance, vulnerability patching, etc.; the host must provide a mechanism for the rapid disablement of known/suspected compromised Terminals. 3.6 Key Injection Facility Assessment 3.6.1 Request Assessment An Acquirer may request the Company conduct an assessment of a Key Injection Facility for the purposes of verifying compliance with certification requirements under IAC Code Set Volume 1 (Introduction and Member Obligations). This clause broadly outlines the process for assessment of a Key Injection Facility by the Company on an Acquirer’s behalf. In this clause, “Applicant” means the Acquirer on whose behalf the Company agrees to conduct an assessment of a Key Injection Facility. 59 Amended effective 1/1/19, version 008 r&p 002.18 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE PART 3 –DEVICE SECURITY Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 19 3.6.2 Nomination for Assessment An Applicant should initiate the assessment process by submitting to the Company: a written request that the Company assess a nominated Key Injection Facility on its behalf; evidence of the consent of the Key Injection Facility to the conduct of the assessment by the Company in accordance with this clause 3.6.2, such consent to be evidenced by a Key Injection Facility Assessment Agreement executed by the Key Injection Facility; and all relevant additional information, including technical materials and evidentiary matters relevant to the Applicant’s certification requirements with respect to key injection practice. 3.6.3 Assessment Process The Company will assess the performance of the Key Injection Facility in relation to the Company’s standards and the Applicant’s requirements. The Key Injection Facility must comply with the standards and requirements set out in Annexure B, together with such additional requirements as may be applicable to the Applicant’s circumstances or requirements. The Key Injection Facility assessment process comprises such business reviews, technical reviews and on-site visits as may be necessary to enable the Company to properly assess the compliance of the Key Injection Facility with applicable requirements. Once a Key Injection Facility has been assessed by the Company as compliant with the applicable requirements, the Acquirer may rely on the assessment only for the purposes of certification under IAC Code Set Volume 1 (Introduction and Member Obligations). The Company may require, at its sole discretion, a Key Injection Facility to provide evidence of its continued compliance with assessment requirements triennially. The Company in its sole discretion may determine whether any other person, including any other Acquirer, may rely on the assessment for certification purposes.

KEY INJECTION FACILITY REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 21 KEY INJECTION FACILITY REQUIREMENTS [Informative] This Annexure will be used by the company in carrying out an assessment of a Key Injection Facility as set out in clause 3.6 of this Code. It provides the assumptions, scope references and definitions in support of the Key Injection Facility Requirements provided in Annexure B. A.1 Assumptions As only AusPayNet approved SCDs are used for key handling, i.e., HSMs, KLDs and Terminals, it is assumed that these devices will only perform in their accredited manner. Therefore, no requirements have been included here that would have been checked during the SCD approval process (i.e., key lengths, algorithms, randomness and uniqueness of keys). This also applies to the tamper responsiveness of the PEDs after key injection.61 KLDs have their own set of requirements which will not need to be rechecked by the facility. This includes how the

Section 3.2, “Maximizing PCI DSS Scope Reduction” (PCI SSC, August 2011), https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Tokenization_Guidelines_Info_Supplement.pdf. 12 In accordance with PCI DSS Requirements. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 21 It should be noted that the encrypted data is still in scope for PCI DSS (generally for the entity that controls or manages the encrypted data or the cryptographic keys13) to ensure that applicable controls are in place. However, by keeping all encryption/decryption and key-management operations isolated from the cloud, the number of PCI DSS requirements that the Provider is required to maintain may be reduced, as these requirements will instead be applicable to the Customer’s own environment and personnel. The Provider will still be in scope for any PCI DSS requirements it manages on behalf of the Customerfor example, access controls managed by the Provider will need to be verified to ensure that only authorized persons (as determined by the Customer) have access to the encrypted data, and that access is not granted to unauthorized persons. Alternatively, if clear-text account data is present (for example, in memory) in the cloud environment, or the ability to retrieve account data exists (for example, if decryption keys and encrypted data are present), all applicable PCI DSS requirements would apply to that environment. For more information, refer to the Information Supplement Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation, which is intended to provide further understanding of scoping and segmentation principles as applicable to the PCI DSS environment.14 4.5.1 Security of Cloud Service Customer Systems Customer systems used to access the cloud environment such as workstation, smartphone and Internet of Things (IoT) device, should not be overlooked, as they could potentially become weak links in a Customer’s cloud security strategy. Customers need to ensure that their systems and internal processes do not provide unauthorized access to the cloud environment. For example, if a Customer workstation or other device is compromised, an attacker may be able to use credentials and an authorized channel to gain access to the cloud environment from the compromised Customer system. The Customer will therefore need to ensure that its Customer-side devices are appropriately secured and protected from unauthorized physical and logical access. Note: Customer-side systems used to access cardholder data in the cloud would also be in scope for all applicable PCI DSS requirements. 13 For additional guidance, refer to FAQ “Is encrypted cardholder data in scope for PCI DSS?” on PCI SSC website. 14 PCI Security Standards Council, Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation (PCI SSC, December 2016), https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Guidance-PCI-DSS-Scoping-and-Segmentation_v1.pdf. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 22 4.5.2 Scoping Examples for Different Cloud Deployment Models For private cloud environments, segmentation efforts are focused on isolating CDE components from non-CDE components to reduce the number of systems in scope for PCI DSS. In public or shared cloud environments, segmentation between cloud tenants is critical for the security of the entire Customer environment and is additional to any segmentation managed by the Customer within its environment for the purposes of scoping. A number of simple scoping examples are presented here to provide guidance. Scenario Environment Description PCI DSS Scoping Guidance Case 1: Private cloud hosted and controlled by entity seeking PCI DSS compliance, with segmentation • All CDE VMs or containers are hosted on a single, dedicated hypervisor/server; non-CDE VMs are hosted on a separate hypervisor(s) or server(s). • Validated segmentation of CDE systems from non-CDE systems using a combination of physical and logical controls.15 The CDE hypervisor, VMs and containers, and all system components that are not segmented are in scope (segmentation must be validated as providing effective isolation). Case 2: Private cloud hosted and controlled by entity seeking PCI DSS compliance, no segmentation • All VMs or containers are hosted on one or more hypervisors or servers; some VMs transmit, process or store cardholder data and are considered CDE systems, and some do not process, transmit or store cardholder data or are not required to communicate to the CDE systems. • No segmentation of CDE systems from non-CDE systems. The entire cloud environment and all connected systems are in scope and considered part of the CDE (similar to a flat network). 15 Penetration Test Guidance Special Interest Group and PCI Security Standards Council, Penetration Testing Guidance, (PCI SSC, September 2017), https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1.pdf.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 23 Scenario Environment Description PCI DSS Scoping Guidance Case 3: Third-party Provider hosting a PCI DSS compliant public cloud supporting multiple Customers, with validated segmentation for Customer environments • VMs may be on one or multiple hypervisors; all hypervisors and VMs are configured by Provider to support PCI DSS requirements. • Multiple Customers are hosted on each hypervisor. • One or more containers running within one or more dedicated container orchestration servers • Validated segmentation of Customer environments using a combination of physical and logical controls The Provider is responsible for compliance of all elements of each underlying PCI DSS compliant cloud service provided to

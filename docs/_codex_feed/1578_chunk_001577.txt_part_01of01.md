Introduction Sending service providers (SSPs) are recognised entities which enable Digital Service Providers (DSPs) to transmit data to the ATO via the ATO ebMS3 messaging standard. This document is a part of a suite of documents developed specifically for SSPs to understand their obligations as an SSP. This document outlines the declaration and signing statements that must be used for the Upload portal and API models. It must be read in conjunction with Section 5.3.1 of the Single Touch Payroll Business implementation guide (STP BIG). 2. Declaration requirements of an SBR API solution An SBR API solution is software that is integrated into the Payroll/ STP compliant solution and supports an end user both checking the STP report and completing the declaration and signing on lodgment of the file to the SSP. There is no manual intervention between the authorisation of the STP report and the submission of the file. 2.1 Digital Service Provider Declaration (DSP) Requirements The DSP who will be using an API provisioned by an SSP must follow the Declarations as specified in the STP BIG section 5.3.1. These are:  ESSP – Employer Sending Service Provider  EMSSP – Employer (Multi ABN) Sending Service Provider  RASSP – Registered Agent Sending Service Provider  RAMSSP – Registered agent (Multi ABN) Sending Service Provider The DSP must continue to populate the PAYEVNT declarations fields and make information about the reporting party and Intermediary available to the SSP outside of the payload. Refer to DSP using SSPs Technical Guidance for further information about what information must be made available. 2.2 Sending Service Provider (SSP) Declaration Requirements For an API, the SSP does not need to present any declaration text to the consumer of the API. 3. SSP Upload Portal Model SBR portal solutions allow an end user to manually upload their STP compliant data/reports into a portal designed to accept STP data and submit to the ATO (the final hop). This model introduces some slight variations to the other models (i.e. where DSP’s connect directly to the ATO or via an automated SSP Integration solution). This paper clarifies the relevant Payevent data requirements and identifies the DSP and SSP declaration requirements to be presented for the Portal model. VERSION 3.0 20 JUNE 2018 UNCLASSIFIED PAGE 6 OF 13 3.1 Overview  The point when the DSP creates the STP compliant data/report is considered when  The authorisation to lodge must be captured in the STP Payevent Payload, and  The relevant declaration must be presented to the user in the DSP solution.  The point when the user (in the portal) triggers the submission to the ATO,  Requires appropriate Portal audit logging, but importantly no change to the declaration details in the payload, and  The relevant declaration must be presented to the user in the Portal solution. 3.2 Digital Service Provider Declaration (DSP) Requirements A DSP in provisioning software that creates an extractable payroll report that may be later manually submitted by the employer/authorised employee or registered agent via an SSP portal must at a minimum ensure one of the following declarations below are made (and resulting fields populated). These declarations are a variation of the ones found in the BIG removing the AUSkey reference in the signing statement in order to satisfy this reporting model. There is no restriction on the DSP in providing additional information as part of the declaration (eg SSP name, if it is known at the time). These declarations are:  EDP – Employer DSP to Portal Upload  RADP – Registered Agent DSP to Portal Upload DecType Code Declaration Statement Signing Statement Employer DSP to Portal Upload EDP The declaration an employer (or authorised employee) must declare is: “I declare the information transmitted in this payroll report is true and correct and I am authorised to make this declaration.” The text describing the way that they are ‘making’ the declaration by ‘signing’ it in a particular way. For example: “Tick this box to sign this declaration with the credentials you used to login.” A statement “Tick this box to sign this declaration”

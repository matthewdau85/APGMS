maximize their effectiveness. If individuals managing and operating these tools do not carry out their oversight responsibilities adequately, the value of such tools—and automation in general—is minimized. Further, violations in compliance may go undetected.

For many organizations, it may be impractical to manually collect and assess security-related information for every aspect of security controls deployed across an organization at all times. For example, it is ineffective to manually perform daily log reviews because it is time- consuming and prone to human error. A more practical approach is to rely on automation and establish reasonable review frequencies and additional triggers for collecting and evaluating security-related information (see 3.6.3, “Automated Control Monitoring”). The focus of manual control reviews should be overseeing the implemented automation and collecting the required evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of the security controls and that policies and procedures are being followed (refer to Appendix D: PCI DSS Compliance Program Activities,” for further information and guidance). 3.6.5 Review Frequency Many organizations choose to perform reviews on an annual basis. However, while annual comprehensive assessments are necessary and provide a good indication of how security controls are performing at a specific point, they do not adequately indicate performance over time and are not sufficient to demonstrate security due diligence. Well-designed review processes enable more real-time monitoring of security controls, including more frequent reviews and coverage of components. With PCI DSS, minimum monitoring frequencies are defined within specific requirements such as daily security log reviews in PCI DSS Requirement 10.6.1, quarterly vulnerability scans in PCI DSS Requirement 11.2, and quarterly reviews of operational procedures in PCI DSS Requirement 12.11. However, the frequencies defined within PCI DSS may not be sufficient to address all risks in certain types of environments. While these frequencies provide a good baseline, organizations should evaluate their environments and implement more rigorous controls as appropriate (refer to Appendix D: PCI DSS Compliance Program Activities,” for further information). The following factors should be considered from an organizational perspective to determine the appropriate assessment frequency for each metric or control: ▪ Security Control Stability – Security control stability is a measure of how frequently a control is likely to change over time. Controls such as requirements for configuration standards (PCI DSS Requirement 2.2) and a system component inventory (PCI DSS Requirement 2.4) may require more frequent assessment and monitoring to ensure that these controls continue to operate effectively. Other controls tend to remain static over long periods and would therefore typically require less frequent assessment, such as requirements for maintaining visitor identification procedures (PCI DSS Requirements 9.2 and 9.4).

For example, if a system-specific risk assessment identifies potential threats and vulnerabilities related to a database, the organization might consider more frequent monitoring of access logs and system-level changes. If the organization also employs a risk ranking mechanism such as that described in PCI DSS Requirement 6.1, the type of the affected system may be used as justification to increase or decrease the monitoring frequencies for related controls. It is important to note that while an organization may choose to employ a risk- scoring mechanism to optimize a specific control-review frequency, certain PCI DSS requirements have required minimum monitoring frequencies. To maintain compliance with PCI DSS, an organization must meet all applicable PCI DSS requirements. ▪ Security Control Failure – Security controls that were previously assessed and identified as having weaknesses or not performing effectively should be monitored more frequently until the control weakness has been remediated (see 3.7, “Detect and Respond to Security Control Failures”). 3.6.6 Control Review Sampling Organizations may also find it impractical and inefficient to collect data from every single system when evaluating security control effectiveness. System sampling, when implemented with caution and awareness, is another mechanism that can make continuous monitoring more cost-effective. Selecting a sample of information systems rather than performing a full inspection of all systems can be a valuable and efficient means of monitoring security control state and effectiveness, particularly in cases where security controls and monitoring mechanisms are not automated. Unfortunately, employing sampling is not without risk due to the possibility that security controls may have failed on specific systems or that systems not following approved configuration standards may have been deployed and thus may go undetected. Another risk associated with sampling is that the sample population may fail to capture the variations in control-review results that would otherwise be obtained from a review of the full population. This variance could result in an inaccurate view of the effectiveness of the assessed security controls and

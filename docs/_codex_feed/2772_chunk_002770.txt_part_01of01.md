from SSF Assessor Company customers or Participating Payment Brands. When an SSF Assessor Company qualifies for Remediation, the SSF Assessor Company will be notified in accordance with the SSF Agreement, typically via registered or overnight mail and/or e-mail. Once the SSF Assessor Company signs the agreement to participate in Remediation (“Remediation Agreement”) and pays the fee(s) required in the notification, the applicable listing on the SSF Assessor Company List will be annotated with “In Remediation” and the listing will display the SSF Assessor Company’s details in red text. Refer to the Website – PCI SSC Programs Fee Schedule for details of all applicable fees. At the time of notification that the SSF Assessor Company qualifies for Remediation, AQM will provide the SSF Assessor Company with information on the requirements and procedures of the Remediation process and what it entails. If, during Remediation, AQM gains sufficient assurance of quality improvement and the requirements of the Remediation Agreement have been fulfilled, Remediation ends, and the SSF Assessor Company’s listing on the Website returns to “In Good Standing” in black text. SSF Assessor Companies that fail to satisfy Remediation requirements may be revoked, and SSF Assessor Companies electing not to participate in Remediation when eligible will be revoked.

into, or deemed entered into prior to or following the Implementation Date, are amended to include the Bailment Terms, in each case with effect from the Implementation Date. 1.2 Process of adherence Adherence to this Protocol is to be evidenced by the execution and delivery to AusPayNet of an Adherence Letter, together with evidence satisfactory in form and substance to AusPayNet of the authority of the signatories to execute the Adherence Letter. Each Adhering Party: (a) agrees that the determination of the date and time of acceptance of any Adherence Letter is to be determined by AusPayNet in its absolute discretion; and (b) consents to the publication of a copy of the Protocol by AusPayNet and to the disclosure by AusPayNet of its name as an Adhering Party to the Protocol. AUSTRALIAN CASH DISTRIBUTUTION AND EXCHANGE SYSTEM (CS5) PROCEDURES ANNEXURE K: CASH OWNERSHIP AND SECURITY PROTOCOL Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 87 1.3 Implementation Date As between any Adhering Parties to a Protocol Covered Agreement, the agreement to make the amendments contemplated by this Protocol, on the terms and conditions set out in this Protocol, is effective from the later of: (a) the date of acceptance by AusPayNet of an Adherence Letter from the latest of such Adhering Parties to adhere; and (b) the day following the date of the Cash Handling Agreement, (such date with respect to such Adhering Parties, the “Implementation Date”). Acceptance by AusPayNet of a subsequent or revised Adherence Letter from any such Adhering Parties does not have the effect of changing such Implementation Date. 1.4 Use of Protocol This Protocol is intended for use without negotiation, but without limiting any amendment, modification or waiver in respect of a Protocol Covered Agreement that the parties may otherwise effect in accordance with the terms of that Protocol Covered Agreement. In adhering to this Protocol, an Adhering Party is not to specify additional provisions, conditions or limitations in its Adherence Letter. Any purported adherence that AusPayNet determines in good faith is not in compliance with this Protocol is void and AusPayNet will inform the relevant party of such fact as soon as reasonably possible after making such determination. 1.5 Adherence is irrevocable Each Adhering Party acknowledges and agrees that adherence to this Protocol is irrevocable. However, an Adhering Party may deliver to AusPayNet a Revocation Notice to designate a Revocation Date in respect of it. The Adhering Party must also provide to AusPayNet evidence satisfactory in form and substance to AusPayNet of the authority of the signatories to execute the Revocation Notice. This Protocol does not amend any Cash Handling Agreement between that Adhering Party and one or more other Adhering Parties which is entered into after that Revocation Date occurs, and such Cash Handling Agreement will not be a Protocol Covered Agreement. However, the designation of the Revocation Date does not affect any amendment effected pursuant to this Protocol to any Protocol Covered Agreement between that Adhering Party and one or more other Adhering Parties that was entered into on or before the Revocation Date, and any such AUSTRALIAN CASH DISTRIBUTUTION AND EXCHANGE SYSTEM (CS5) PROCEDURES ANNEXURE K: CASH OWNERSHIP AND SECURITY PROTOCOL Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 88 amendment remains effective despite the occurrence of that Revocation Date. Any Revocation Notice that AusPayNet determines in good faith is not in compliance with this clause 1.5 (“Adherence is irrevocable”) is void and AusPayNet will inform the Adhering Party of such fact as soon as reasonably possible after making such determination. AusPayNet will promptly notify each Adhering Party if it receives a Revocation Notice. 1.6 Cut-off date Where there is a change in circumstances that is materially adverse to AusPayNet’s ability to administer this Protocol, AusPayNet may, in its sole and absolute discretion, upon thirty calendar days’ notice on its website at http://auspaynet.com.au/ (or by other suitable means), designate a closing date of this Protocol (such closing date, the “Cut- off Date”). After the Cut-off Date, AusPayNet will not accept any further Adherence Letters to this Protocol. 1.7 Retirement of AusPayNet (a) If AusPayNet no longer wishes to be a party to this Protocol, it will: (i) promptly notify each Customer and advise each Customer of its proposed successor; (ii) provide any information reasonably required by a Customer to consider whether the proposed successor would be appropriate; and (iii) provide the Customers with a period of no less than 20 Business Days, commencing from the date of the notification issued under paragraph (i) above, (“Consultation Period”) to consider the proposal and during that time AusPayNet agrees to take into consideration any concerns or issues raised by the Customers with respect to the appointment of the proposed successor and to use reasonable endeavours to address such concerns or issues. Each Customer must notify AusPayNet by the end of the Consultation Period whether or not they consent to the appointment of the proposed successor. Any Customer that does not provide such notification will be deemed to have consented. If a simple majority of the Customers consents, or is deemed to have consented, to the appointment of the proposed successor, AusPayNet may arrange for the proposed successor (“Successor”) to replace AusPayNet as a party to, and assume all its obligations under and in connection with, this Protocol. AusPayNet will only retire after a Successor has been appointed AUSTRALIAN CASH DISTRIBUTUTION AND EXCHANGE SYSTEM (CS5) PROCEDURES

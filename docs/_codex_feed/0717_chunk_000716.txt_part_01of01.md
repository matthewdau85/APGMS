EMV@ATM TERMINAL STANDARDS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 111 Identification of fallback transactions111 An issuer may use a combination of fields to identify a fallback transaction. A typical fallback transaction request message (0200) should be coded as follows. Please note that 0220 advice messages are not used in the ATM environment for fallback. Field 47 Additional Data National Field 47 should contain the faulty card read flag FCR\ (clause G.5) and also the Terminal Capability Code TCCnn\ should be present with a value of “nn” between 2 and 7. The FCR\ flag indicates that an unsuccessful attempt was made to read the chip and the TCCnn\ indicates that the Terminal has chip read capability. 00 Unknown 01 Mag-stripe reader 02 Contact ICC reader 03 Magnetic-stripe and contact ICC readers 04 Contactless ICC reader 05 Magnetic-stripe and contactless ICC readers 06 Contact and contactless ICC readers 07 Magnetic-stripe, contact and contactless ICC readers Table G.5.2 - TCCnn\ Values Note that this value does not just represent the hardware capabilities of the ATM, rather TCC should be set to correctly represent both the hardware and software capabilities of the ATM.112 Field 22 Point of sale entry mode For a correctly coded fallback transaction field 22 should have a value of “621” indicating magnetic-stripe read in an ICC capable ATM. Service Code (from track 2) The expected service code encoded on the card must be 2xx or 6xx indicating the card is an ICC card. Note the acquirers will not be able to identify a counterfeit card where the fraudster has changed the value of the service code (provided they have also recalculated the LRC- Longitudinal Redundancy Check). Fallback rates Acquirers should endeavour to maintain fallback rates of less than 3% of the total transaction volumes processed over a month. 111 Inserted effective 21/11/17, version 006 r&p 002.17 112 Inserted effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 6 – ATM SYSTEM CODE ANNEXURE G. EMV@ATM TERMINAL STANDARDS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 112 Faulty card and counterfeit card transactions should be excluded when considering fallback rates. An Issuer may notify AusPayNet if it considers that an Acquirer is consistently exceeding the recommended fallback rate. G.6 Receipts In addition to the requirements of clause 2.1.2 of Volume 3 (Acquirers Code) of the IAC Code Set, the value of the AID shall be printed or displayed on the receipt. The application label may be used as an alternative to the AID.113 G.7 ATM configuration The Terminal Type (TAG 9F35) shall be set to 14 or Unattended, On-line only, for all ATMs. Terminal Capabilities (TAG 9F35) Encoding of the Terminal capabilities (TAG 9F33), typically 0x60,0x40 or 0x20, is illustrated in Tables G.7.1A to G.7.1C below.

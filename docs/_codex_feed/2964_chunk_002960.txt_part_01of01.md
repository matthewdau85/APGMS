configured to utilize computing resources from a public cloud as needed during peak capacity times (sometimes called "cloud-bursting"). 2.2 Cloud Capabilities Types and Cloud Service Categories Cloud service categories ("<Something>-as-a-Service") identify different control options for the Customer and Provider. For example, SaaS Customers simply use the applications and services provided by the Provider, where IaaS Customers maintain control of their own environments hosted on the Provider’s underlying infrastructure. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines three types of cloud service categories.7 Software as a Service (SaaS) – Capability for Customers to use the Provider’s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser, or a program interface. Platform as a Service (PaaS) – Capability for Customers to deploy their applications (created or acquired) onto the cloud infrastructure, using programming languages, libraries, services and tools supported by the Provider. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) – Capability for Customers to utilize the Provider’s processing, storage, networks and other fundamental computing resources to deploy and run operating systems, applications and other software on a cloud infrastructure. There are other standards and frameworks that define different vocabulary and reference architecture (e.g., ISO/IEC 17788:2014) which are mostly comparable with the terms and categories defined by NIST. For consistency, this guidance document uses NIST terminology (i.e., SaaS, PaaS and IaaS) to describe the service categories of Provider services. The main differences between cloud service categories relate to how control is shared between Customer and Provider, which in turn affects the level of responsibility for both parties. It should be noted that, other than in a self-managed private cloud scenario, the Customer rarely has any control over hardware, and it is the degree to which virtual components, applications and software are managed by the different parties that differentiates the cloud service categories. As a general rule, SaaS provides Customers with the least amount of control, whereas IaaS offers the most control for the Customer. Figure 1 shows how control is typically shared between the Provider and Customer across different service categories. 7 Wayne Jansen and Timothy Grance, NIST Guidelines on Security and Privacy in Public Cloud Computing, NIST Special Publication 800-144, (Gaithersburg: National Institute of Standards and Technology, December 2011) . https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-144.

The greatest level of responsibility for the Provider to maintain security and operational controls is present in the SaaS service category. While Customers may be attracted to the SaaS and PaaS categories due to the resource savings and reduced responsibility for administering the cloud environment, they should be aware that these categories also correspond to a greater loss of control of the environment housing their sensitive data. Contractual agreements and ongoing due diligence become especially critical where control is outsourced, to ensure that the required security measures are being met and maintained by the Provider for the duration of the agreement. It is important to note that these descriptions for cloud deployment models and cloud service categories, although now standardized and widely accepted by the industry, may not be universally followed by Providers or reflect actual cloud environments. For example, a Provider might be selling a "private cloud" service that does not meet the intent of "private" as it is described above. Similarly, the details of what is and what is not included in a particular service will probably vary between Providers, even if they identify their services by the same term (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS). It is expected that as the industry and the Customer requirements evolve as cloud offerings mature, there will be additional cloud service categories besides those listed above. However, this guidance document focuses on the prevailing three cloud service categories: SaaS, PaaS and IaaS.

Customers should not make assumptions about any serviceclear policies and procedures should be agreed upon between Customer and Provider for all security requirements, and clear responsibilities for operation, management and reporting need to be defined for each requirement. The PCI Security Standards Council has published the Information Supplement Third-Party Security Assurance, which provides further guidance on implementing third-party assurance program.8 3.2 Roles and Responsibilities for Different Cloud Deployment Models The entity performing the role of Provider will vary according to the type of deployment model. For example, the Provider role may be assigned entirely to an external third party (as in a public cloud), or the role may be undertaken by an internal department or business function (as in an on-premises private cloud). Similarly, the role of Provider may be assigned to

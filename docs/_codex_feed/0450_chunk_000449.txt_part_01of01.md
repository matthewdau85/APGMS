(c) Secondary communication lines to the Primary Computer Site must be tested at least four times a year at intervals of no less than two months. Where an Active-Active Site Configuration or Rotating Site Configuration is used, then the secondary communications lines at each site must be tested at least two times per year at intervals of no less than four months.230 7.8 Back-up Computer Requirements (a) Each Framework Participant must have a Back-up Computer Site configuration which includes the hardware, software and ancillary equipment required to recover that member’s SWIFT PDS System operations if its Primary Computer Site fails.231 225 Last amended effective 19/11/24, version 045 r&p 002.24 226 Deleted effective 14/11/22, version 041 r&p 001.22 227 Deleted effective 18/04/05, version 015 r&p 001.05 228 Inserted effective 13/10/03, version 010 r&p 002.03 229 Last amended effective 26/11/18, version 038 r&p 001.18 230 Amended effective 19/11/24, version 045 r&p 002.24 231 Last amended effective 23/4/98, version 001 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES PART 7: FRAMEWORK PARTICIPANT TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 48 (b) The level of back-up computer support that a Framework Participant must have is dependent upon the value of SWIFT PDS payments sent and received using the SWIFT PDS.

The data used will be for the calendar Q3 period. Where a new Framework Participant joins the HVCS during the statistical collection period, its percentage share of Total National Transaction Value will be calculated on a pro-rata basis by reference to the actual period of membership of that Framework Participant.236 (b) If any Framework Participant reasonably believes that it should be allocated a different Back-up Tier, then that member may in writing provide justification and a request that the Company consider applying a different Back-up Tier. The Company will notify the Participant of the outcome of its consideration and make any change as it deems appropriate.237 (c) An Applicant for HVCS membership must provide to the Company in connection with its HVCS membership application a reasonable estimate in writing of its likely SWIFT PDS traffic.

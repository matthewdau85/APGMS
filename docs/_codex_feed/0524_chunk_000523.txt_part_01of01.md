the occurrence of any FTS Event or Potential FTS Event. 12.3 FTS Event An FTS Event occurs where a Tier 1 Framework Participant fails to settle for the obligations incurred by it under: (a) these Regulations and the Procedures, or (b) the regulations and the procedures or manual for any other Clearing System which include provisions which: (i) govern the conduct of settlement when a member of that Clearing System (the “Clearing System Defaulter”) fails to settle its settlement obligations under that Clearing System, provided that with respect to the High Value Clearing System (CS4) (“HVCS”), at the time of such failure to settle, settlement of HVCS payments is prescribed to occur on a deferred net basis, and (ii) provide at least once on each business day for bilateral netting of settlement of amounts owed to or by that Clearing System Defaulter as a result of the exchange of payment instructions in accordance with those regulations and the procedures. 12.4 Deferral of Settlement If the Reserve Bank or the Company becomes aware of a Potential FTS Event or a Disabling Event, the Company or the Reserve Bank (in each case in consultation with Australian Paper Clearing System (CS1) REGULATIONS PART 12 FAILURE TO SETTLE Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 72 the other) may defer until a later time the time prescribed for any settlement affected or potentially affected by that Potential FTS Event or Disabling Event. In addition, in such circumstances, the Chief Executive Officer may take such other action as is permitted by PART 11 of these Regulations. 12.5 Suspension (a) If an FTS Event occurs, further exchanges of Items between the Defaulter and Survivors (but not between Survivors) pursuant to these Regulations and the Procedures are automatically suspended. (b) Upon the suspension of exchanges between the Defaulter and the Survivors under Regulation 12.5(a), the membership of the Defaulter in APCS is also suspended and subject to the other provisions of this PART 12 the provisions of Regulations 4.15 to 4.19 inclusive apply as though the automatic suspension under this Regulation 12.5 were a suspension under Regulation 4.14. 12.6 Responsibility for Further Exchanges (a) Following suspension of exchanges between the Defaulter and Survivors under Regulation 12.5 and except as may be required in accordance with Regulations 4.15 to 4.19 inclusive, Survivors are not responsible for any failure to conduct further exchanges of Items with the Defaulter or to perform other obligations arising from the exchange of Items with the Defaulter (excluding any such obligations under this PART 12). (b) Where following an FTS Event a Framework Participant becomes a Defaulter and exchanges with the Defaulter are suspended in APCS, then any Items already lodged within APCS and the subject of a Failed Settlement may be exchanged bilaterally and the obligations arising from such exchanges (and any obligations arising from Items already exchanged within APCS and the subject of the Failed Settlement) may be netted at least once on each business day between the Defaulter and a Survivor unless the Survivor indicates otherwise. However a Survivor which conducts such exchanges and netting and suffers any liability or loss as a result of such conduct has no recourse to the Company, or to any other Survivor, under these Regulations or the Procedures or the regulations or the procedures or the manual for any other Clearing System with respect to that liability or loss. 12.7 Netting with Defaulter Netting of any amounts owing to the Defaulter by Survivors and by the Defaulter to Survivors in connection with the Failed Settlement is to take place at least once on each business day on a bilateral net basis between the Defaulter and each Survivor at such time and in such manner as the Defaulter and the Survivor determine. 12.8 Cross Clearings System Netting Provision At least once on each business day, the amount owed to a Survivor by the Defaulter or by a Survivor to the Defaulter pursuant to Regulation 12.7 is to be netted with each other bilateral net amount owed to that Survivor by the Defaulter or by that Survivor to the Defaulter in each other Clearing System in which any such bilateral net amount Australian Paper Clearing System (CS1) REGULATIONS PART 12 FAILURE TO SETTLE Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 73 is owed following an FTS Event in that Clearing System. Settlement of the resulting net amount is to take place at such time and in such manner as the Defaulter and the Survivor determine. 12.9 Cheque Items Deemed Dishonoured (a) Cheque Items drawn on the Defaulter which have been lodged with Survivors but which have not been settled and are taken to be dishonoured by operation of Section 70A(1) of the Cheques Act 1986 (Cth) must not be included in calculating each Survivor’s bilateral net position in relation to the Defaulter for the purposes of the bilateral net settlements referred to in Regulation 12.7. “Lodged” in this Regulation 12.9 has the same meaning as it has in Section 70A(1) of the Cheques Act. Notwithstanding anything in the Procedures to the contrary, if such Cheque Items are returned to the Survivors, those Survivors are not required to give value for those Cheque Items. (b) In order to assist Survivors to identify Cheque Items that are taken to be dishonoured in the event of the operation of Section 70A(1) of the Cheques Act, each Tier 1

Peppol supports more than the invoice and includes a suite of eProcurement business documents that can be used in Australia and New Zealand which includes the below: Catalogue (and Catalogue Response): enables the automated exchange of catalogue information including the seller providing a new, updated, or deleted catalogue, and the buyer advising whether the information (new or updates) is accepted in the buyers’ ERP system. Punch Out: enables integration between the seller’s web catalogue and buyer’s procurement system to create a product or service list for the buyer, which can later be used as the basis for an order or item comparison list. Order (and Order Response): enables order automation in line with catalogue and invoice. A buyer creates an order and the seller either accepts the order, accepts the order with changes or rejects the order and responds with the required information. Invoices containing an order reference can be matched automatically. Despatch Advice: enables communication between Seller and Consignee regarding transport details including packing and delivery, ordering details including what was sent, quantity of goods sent and items outstanding, and receiving goods including delivery time and address details. Invoice or credit note: enables the supplier to send an invoice or credit note to the buyer or for the buyer to issue a recipient created tax invoice. Invoice Response: enables status messages to be communicated between a supplier and buyer for an invoice or credit note. For example, an invoice is accepted, being processed, rejected, under query or paid. Message level response : The outcome of message validation against the specification sent between the access points.

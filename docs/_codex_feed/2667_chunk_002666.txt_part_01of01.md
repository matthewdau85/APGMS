Page 1 1 Introduction This document supplements and should be read in conjunction with the PFI Program Guide and the QSA Qualification Requirements, as well as the other documents referenced in Section 1.2 below. Capitalized and other terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall be defined as provided in Appendix D, as applicable. Background To help ensure the security of cardholder data, applicable payment card industry rules require merchants, service providers, financial institutions and other entities that process, store or transmit cardholder data to comply with the relevant PCI Standards. Compliance with the PCI DSS is assessed either by companies qualified to do so by PCI SSC (including but not limited to “QSAs”) or by the merchant, service provider, financial institution, or other entity itself. In the event of an actual or suspected attack, compromise or vulnerability affecting payment card transactions or cardholder data, forensic investigation may be required. Forensic investigation of this kind can be challenging and complex, requiring forensic investigators with highly specialized skills and proven staff and experience, capable of rapid response. Prior to the PFI Program, Participating Payment Brands maintained separate requirements for forensic investigators for such events, and the process of selecting or being qualified as an investigator could be complicated and cumbersome, especially when the Security Issue in question affected multiple Participating Payment Brands. The PFI Program represents a streamlining of requirements for forensic investigators, and is intended to help simplify and expedite procedures and requirements for being qualified as, and engaging with, forensic investigators. PFI Program In an effort to help ensure that each PFI Company and PFI Employee possesses the requisite knowledge, skills, experience and capacity to perform PFI Investigations in a proficient manner in accordance with industry expectations, each PFI Company and each PFI Employee (including Core Forensic Investigators and Lead Investigators) is required at all times to satisfy all applicable PFI Qualification Requirements, and must demonstrate the same as part of initial PFI qualification and annually thereafter. Once qualified, and thereafter while in Good Standing, a PFI Company is eligible to perform PFI Investigations of Security Issues where the PFI Company has determined (in good faith, prior to initiating the PFI Investigation) that the associated data loss originated in a PFI Region for which that PFI Company is then qualified in accordance with the PFI Program. This document is intended for candidate and existing PFI Companies and PFI Employees, as well as Approving Organizations, and sets forth the additional requirements that must be satisfied by a given QSA and its employees in order to be qualified as a PFI Company, PFI Employee, Core Forensic Investigator or Lead Investigator (as applicable) under the PCI SSC PFI Program. IMPORTANT NOTE: Qualification as a PFI Company or PFI Employee requires that the company or employee in question at all times be a PCI SSC-qualified QSA Company or QSA Employee (for Core Forensic Investigators), as applicable. Accordingly, qualification as a PFI Company or PFI Employee will immediately and automatically terminate if the underlying QSA qualification is revoked, cancelled, withdrawn or terminated.

Page 2 Interested entities must meet or exceed all applicable PFI Requirements in order to be qualified as a PFI Company or PFI Employee and maintain Good Standing as such. 1.1 Qualification Process Overview PFI Company qualification involves: (a) review of initial application materials submitted by the candidate PFI Company to determine whether the materials satisfy minimum eligibility requirements (“Document Review”), (b) follow-up information requests and interviews with key PFI Employees (collectively,

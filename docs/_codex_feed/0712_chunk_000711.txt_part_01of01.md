DIRECT CHARGING RULES Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 98 Partial Dispense and Fees The operation of a Partial Dispense is illustrated below. The essential features are: (a) The Acquirer will initiate an 0420 Reversal Advice Message with bits 4 (Amount, Transaction) and bit 57 (Amount, cash) identical to the 0200 Request message. Bit 28 (Amount, Transaction Fee) will be identical to the same field in the request message but with the indicator digit 'X'set to 'C'for credit. (b) In the subsequent Transaction Advice message, bit 4 and 57 will contain identical amounts and be equal to the actual amount dispensed by the ATM. In the Transaction Advice message bit 28 must be set to zero ('D000000000000') as no ATM Operator Fee is applicable in this case (see clause F.4.2 above).

DIRECT CHARGING RULES Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 99 (a) ATM Operator Fees may be levied on Balance Inquiries. To prevent the ATM Operator Fee overdrawing the account Issuers may, in cases where this could occur, decline the Transaction (response Framework = 51 – insufficient funds). (b) The balance returned must reflect the impact of the ATM Operator Fee. (c) The inclusion of an ATM Operator Fee converts a Balance Inquiry Transaction to a financial Transaction (previously a non-financial Transaction) as such the fee value must be included in daily Interchange Settlement Reports. (d) Acquirers must ensure that full reversal processing is available on Balance Inquiries. Bit 28 of the 0420 message shall contain the same value as in the 0200 message but with the indicator 'X'set to 'C'indicating the value is owed to the Issuer.

DIRECT CHARGING RULES Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 100 Use of Bit 28 when no ATM Operator Fee is being levied Bit 28 is a conditional field that does not have to be present for every ATM Transaction. If an ATM Operator Fee is being levied then it must be included in the 0200 message and all subsequent messages (as described above). However if an ATM Operator Fee is not being levied then bit 28can either be omitted or included with the n8 component being set to zero. Issuer systems must accommodate both possibilities. F.7 Settlement of ATM Operator Fees ATM Operator Fees must be included in daily settlement figures and settled in accordance with IAC Code Set Volume 5 (Settlement).78 F.8 Transition For a period of 3 months commencing on the ATM Direct Charging Date an Acquirer may comply with the rules in this clause F.8 in lieu of compliance with the disclosure rules in clause F.4. F.9 Damages for Non-compliance with Direct Charging Rules (a) This clause F.9 applies to Direct Charging Systems Error. In this Code, a Direct Charging Systems Error is a systems error that: (i) causes material non-compliance with these Direct Charging Rules; and (ii) affects 10 or more ATM Transactions. (b) Each IA Participant agrees that the amount of $7,500.00 is a conservative and genuine pre-estimate of the total loss that all IA Participants that are ATM Issuers will suffer as a result of a Direct Charging Systems Error. (c) If a Direct Charging Systems Error occurs, then: (i) the loss suffered by each IA Participant that is an Issuer (Issuer Framework Participant) as a result

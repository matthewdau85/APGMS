Specifically, aggressive mode must NOT be used. Where encrypted shared-secrets are used, key management, including the process of key (secret) entry must comply with the requirements of AS 2805.6.1, especially the requirement that no one person must have the capability to access or ascertain any plain text secret or private key. 2.4.10 Key Management Practices for IAC Interchange Lines32 Clause 2.4.10 is Confidential 2.5 Cardholder Data All parties to Interchange, including Merchants, Acquirers, Third Party Providers and any intermediate network entities must maintain procedures and practices for preventing the unauthorised disclosure of Cardholder Data which, includes but is not necessarily limited to the: 33 Primary Account Number; Cardholder Name; Service Code; 32 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 33 Amended effective 1/1/19, version 008 r&p 002.18 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE PART 2 – TRANSACTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 11 Expiration Date.

These components may be present in various configurations, dependent upon the function and capability of the Terminal.35 Those components of a Terminal that provide cryptographic services and any services involved in requesting, reception and/or processing of the Cardholder PIN, the Cardholder Data or the Transaction must be approved for use by the Company (see IAC Code Set Volume 4 (Device Requirements and Cryptographic Management).36 3.2 EFTPOS Terminals37 3.2.1 Physical Characteristics and Key Management Protocols If Terminals employ key-management schemes not specifically permitted in AS 2805.6 series, Acquirers may seek approval for their deployment from the Company. 38 For the avoidance of doubt, a Terminal shall not rely on tamper evidence as its sole physical security characteristic (ISO 9564.1 clause 5.1). Terminals must also meet the following requirements:39 when employing a “master/session key” key-management scheme (e.g., AS 2805.6.4); or40 when employing a “unique key per Transaction” key-management scheme (e.g., AS 2805.6.7) they must meet, at a minimum, the requirements of a Physically Secure Device as defined in AS 2805.14.1;41 devices must generate and verify MACs as per AS 2805.4.1 for all value Transaction messages; and 35 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 36 Last amended effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 37 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 38 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 39 Last amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 40 Amended effective 21/11/16, version 004 r&p 002.16 41 Amended effective 21/11/16, version 004 r&p 002.16 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE PART 3 –DEVICE SECURITY Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 13 use one of the PIN block formats, excluding format 1, specified in ISO 9564.1. Format 3 is preferred. Format 8, here described, may also be used where required:42 (i) A format 8 PIN block may be used where a PIN Block is required but no PIN is available. The PIN block is constructed by the modulo 2 addition of two 64-bit fields formatted as follows:43 1. a plain text field44 Bit 1 5 9 13 17 21 25 29 33 37 41 45 49 53 57 61 64 C N R R R R R R R R R R R R F F and; 2. the account number field45 Bit 1 5 9 13 17 21 25 29 33 37 41 45 49 53 57 61 64 0 0 0 0 A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 A9 A10 A11 A12 Where:46 C = Control Field • 1000 (binary) N = PIN length • 0000 (binary) R = Random digit • 4-bit binary field with each occurrence

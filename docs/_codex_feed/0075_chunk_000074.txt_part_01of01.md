content for the PID through several working groups, representing Members from the Issuers and Acquirers Community (IAC). Since December 2022, four iterations of working group meetings have been held, resulting in the final draft of the PID being endorsed in May 2023. The plan to migrate to AES has two phases: Initiation and Mobilisation (July 2023 – December 2024): This phase includes preparatory activities to finalise outstanding issues – including the technical blueprint, testing strategy, migration approach, legal, risk and compliance assessment – to provide time for participants to formalise their business cases, secure funding, and mobilise teams. It is anticipated that participants will be ready to commence their programs by January 2025. Execution (January 2025 – December 2030): This phase includes industry readiness activities leading to an industry pilot, with migration to follow. An extended period of coexistence has been planned for the migration. This enables assets to be upgraded in line with their natural replacement cycles, as far as is possible, thus reducing marginal effort and cost. Execution will complete once all assets have been upgraded and TDES (Triple Data Encryption Standard) has been removed. In July, work commenced on the first six months of the Initiation and Mobilisation phase, focused on the technical blueprint and options to approach the migration. top Update on legacy payment systems In its Strategic Plan for Australia’s Payments System , Treasury says: “A key priority for the Government is to ensure the payments system fosters the development of modern, efficient payment infrastructure that promotes greater financial inclusion and delivers a seamless user experience.” According to the Plan, achieving this priority will include providing policy direction for legacy systems such as cheques and the Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS). AusPayNet supports the policy outcomes described in the Plan and will continue to lead with its programs associated with the management of legacy payments systems. Cheques The Plan details a focus on phasing out government use of cheques by 2028 and, subject to consultation, expects the eventual wind down of the cheques system to happen no later than 2030. AusPayNet continues to proactively respond to the customer-led decline of cheques with a program of work that commenced in 2019. This program has focused on ensuring that participants in the Australian Paper Clearing System Framework (Cheques Framework) can make their own individual choices, that we promote payment neutrality in legislation (both state and federal), and that we promote inclusivity through community and market education on the decline of cheque usage and availability of modern payment alternatives. In line with the Plan, AusPayNet’s program will focus on: Community outreach: Liaising with industry groups, organisation and representative bodies that still use cheques to continue our education on the decline of cheques and modern payment alternatives. Government engagement: There remains a need to move to payment neutrality in legislation, not only to enable participants to adopt payment alternatives today, but also to future-proof that legislation for developments in payments technology. AusPayNet also looks forward to responding to Treasury’s consultation on the future of cheques, which is due to be released later this year. Operational efficiency: As usage continues to decline and participants of the Cheques Framework cease to use and offer cheques, it is important that operational processes are reviewed to help minimise any impact on users of cheques as well as operators of the cheques system. BECS BECS enables the processing of Direct Entry payments, including direct debits and direct credits, between individual accounts held at different Australian financial institutions. As the Plan observes, this system has served Australia well, enabling businesses, governments, and individuals to make both one-off and recurring payments since the mid-1990s. But since that time, more modern payment alternatives have emerged, that are equipped with greater functionality and capability. AusPayNet has consulted with BECS members, users of the system and providers of payment alternatives to test the appetite for, and readiness to adopt, BECS alternatives. Consultation has confirmed that while a move away from BECS represents both opportunity and challenges, there is a strong case for change. Consultation also revealed that the readiness for adoption of alternatives varies depending on the specific BECS use cases. As an example, we have already seen the take up of payment alternatives for single payment use cases, whereas the preferred approach for processing bulk files continues to be BECS. Following the consultation, AusPayNet is looking to set the strategic direction for the future of the BECS Framework. Over the coming months, target timeframes, industry monitoring and reporting, a governance structure, and a related communications plan will be developed. More detail on this plan will be available by the end of the year. top Cross-border payments update Since delivering its Priorities for the next phase of work , the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has published its Priority actions for achieving the G20 targets . This articulates specific action items across the themes of: Payment system interoperability and extension Legal, regulatory and supervisory frameworks Cross-border data exchange and message standards. In support of these themes, two taskforces have been established: The Committee on Payment and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) has established the Payment System Interoperability and Extension (PIE) Taskforce to bring together the public and private sectors to provide advice and coordination, and to plan implementation measures to improve market conventions and practices. The FSB has established the Legal, Regulatory and Supervisory (LRS) Taskforce, which brings together public and private sector experts

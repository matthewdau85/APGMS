Welcome Welcome to the second Cross-Border Payments Round-Up, a biannual newsletter sharing updates on the progress of the global roadmap for enhancing cross-border payments. The Financial Stability Board's (FSB) 'Enhancing Cross-Border Payments Roadmap' aims to deliver faster, cheaper, more transparent and more inclusive cross-border payment services for all. Maintaining the safety and security of payment systems and platforms is paramount. Significant momentum has been achieved by the FSB and its partners as they pursue improvements in cross-border payments. In this issue, we highlight some of the key activities and output, as well as Australia’s response. We also take a look at upcoming roadmap activities. The FSB’s three priorities for the next phase of work to Enhance Cross-Border Payments The FSB has published its 'Priorities for the next phase of work' for taking the Roadmap forward. The three themes they have identified and are focusing on for the next phase are: Payment system interoperability and extension; Local, legal and supervisory frameworks; and Cross-border data exchange and message standards. Source: CPMI Source: FSB Cross-Border Payments Advisory Council AusPayNet's Cross Border Payments Advisory Council (CBPAC) continues to support and coordinate industry activities, including involvement in consultations and delivering change, which will be key to successfully implementing the roadmap and domestic cross-border payment priorities. Focus area progress Focus Area A: Public and Private Sector Commitment In October 2021, the FSB published its final report on ’Targets for addressing the four challenges of cross-border payments ’, which included input from a consultation to which AusPayNet responded in July 2021. In July 2022, the FSB outlined its preferred data collection and publication methodology in its interim report, ‘ Developing the Implementation Approach for the Cross-Border Payments Targets ’. AusPayNet responded to the feedback questions on the data collection methodology. AusPayNet is currently working with our members on benchmarking Australia’s performance against the challenge of speed. See Appendix 1 for the key performance indicators. Focus Area B: Regulatory, Supervisory and Oversight Frameworks In December 2021, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank published ‘ A draft framework for money laundering/terrorist financing risk assessment of a remittance corridor ’. The objective of this framework is to guide national regulators and law enforcement in collaborating to perform corridor risk assessments, which underpin the identification of safe remittance corridors (SRC). In an Australian context, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) undertook some initial work on remittance corridors in 2017, which was funded by the Commonwealth Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). Focus Area C: Existing Payment Infrastructures and Arrangements In December 2021, CPMI issued its consultative report on ‘ Extending and aligning payment system operating hours for cross-border payments ’. AusPayNet engaged with its high value clearing system (HVCS) members and submitted the final response to CPMI in January, 2022. In May, CPMI published their final report on ‘ Extending and aligning operating hours of key payment systems ’. In Australia, the New Payments Platform could be used for one or more interbank legs of a cross-border payment, based on correspondent banking arrangements. CPMI cited this particular approach in its final report as a means to enhance the speed of 24/7 cross-border payments. The Report for National Authorities with respect to Building Block 10 ( Improving access to payment systems for cross-border payments: best practices for self-assessments ) was also published in May 2022. The paper provided detailed guidance in three key areas: the benefits, risks and barriers that central banks and payment system operators need to consider when assessing the case for expanding access to payment systems a detailed framework that can be used by central banks and payment system operators that are considering expanding access for self-assessing the access policies of domestic payment systems based on best practices existing examples and lessons learned through case studies of jurisdictions that have successfully expanded access and overcome existing barriers. The RBA received the report, and it has also been distributed to AusPayNet’s HVCS members. In July, CPMI published their Report to the G20, ‘ Interlinking payment systems and the role of application programming interfaces: a framework for cross-border payments ’. This paper focuses on interlinking of cross-jurisdictional fast payment systems (for example, if the NPP was to interlink with the National Payments Corporation of India’s UPI system) and provides guidance for establishing interlinking, so that these arrangements are supported by appropriate standards and legal agreements. Focus Area D: Data and Market Practices In April 2022, AusPayNet was invited to attend a restricted outreach session with the FSB and other sector participants to discuss Building Block 16 (Unique identifiers and proxy register for cross-border payments). There was general agreement regarding participants potentially expanding Legal Entity Identifiers (LEI) to a broad range of legal entities. There was also a great deal of discussion regarding the use of identifiers for natural persons. Specifically, it was recommended that the FSB perform a deep dive on the use cases, bearing in mind the particular complexities of cross-jurisdictional privacy frameworks. The FSB is continuing with its deep dive into use cases. In July, the FSB published ‘ Options to improve adoption of the LEI, in particular for use in cross-border payments ’ (Building Block 16). This paper recommends broader use of the LEI globally, including within cross-border payments. In Australia, LEI usage is governed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and is required for derivative transaction reporting ( Regulatory Guide 251 ).

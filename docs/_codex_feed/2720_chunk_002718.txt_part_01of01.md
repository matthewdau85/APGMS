Page 12 1052300.5 The option for credit card payment is not offered on regional fee invoices. However, the option can be added to the invoice upon request. A fee of 3% of the total invoice will be added for processing. 6.4.1 Regions  QSA Companies are authorized to perform PCI DSS Assessments and QSA-related duties only in the geographic region(s) or country(s) for which they have paid the regional or country fees, and as indicated on the QSA List.  Under no circumstances may QSA Companies perform PCI DSS Assessments—or act as a QSA Company in any capacity—outside of the qualified region(s). For example, if a Merchant is headquartered in the US and has satellite offices in-scope for PCI DSS located in Singapore, the QSA Company must be qualified in both USA and Asia Pacific before they are permitted to perform QSA Services for the merchant.  If QSA-related tasks must be performed outside of the qualified region it may be necessary to engage a QSA Company qualified for that region to perform the related tasks. Refer to 6.4.2, “Subcontracting,” below.  To add or remove a region, contact the QSA Program Manager at PCI SSC. Added regions will appear on the QSA List on the Website pending receipt of payment fees and evidence of insurance. 6.4.2 Subcontracting A QSA Company's engagement, hiring, or other use of any other company, organization, or individual (other than an Assessor-Employee directly employed by that QSA Company) to perform any aspect of the services to be performed in connection with any PCI DSS Assessment, is considered to be subcontracting and requires prior written consent by PCI SSC in each instance. This applies whether or not the subcontracted entity or individual is already a QSA Company or an Assessor-Employee of a different QSA Company. The QSA Company must also provide to PCI SSC proof of bound insurance coverage for all such subcontractors to demonstrate policies are in accordance with QSA Program insurance coverage requirements (see Appendix B of the QSA Qualification Requirements). PCI SSC's consent to any such subcontracting shall be subject to such terms, conditions, and requirements as PCI SSC may in its sole discretion deem necessary, reasonable, or appropriate under the circumstances. Note: To obtain PCI SSC's consent to the use of a given subcontractor, please contact the QSA Program Manager at qsa@pcisecuritystandards.org. 6.4.3 Insurance The QSA Company must adhere to all requirements for insurance coverage required by PCI SSC, as outlined in Appendix B, “Insurance Coverage,” of the QSA Qualification Requirements.

CASE STUDY Qualified Integrators and Resellers (QIR)™ Training Commitment to payment card security… How has QIR training benefitted your company? The QIR program has dual benefits for ICS. On the surface, having our technicians certified as QIRs demonstrates our commitment to payment card security within our industry. The main benefit though comes from the focused approach of the program which delivers highly actionable information to the QIR candidates. As a result, we have a team that is more aware of the specific dangers that can threaten a business and how to help our customers mitigate those threats. How is your company viewed in the industry? ICS is widely respected within the car wash industry. Our expertise with innovative payment solutions and, specifically, payment card security is due largely to our involvement with the PCI Council. ICS is a Participating Organization, has listings for PA-DSS payment applications, and staffs PCIPs and QIRs. Our commitment to our customers is matched by our commitment to our industry. Any negative publicity from a breach or fraudulent activity will affect the perception of the car wash industry as a whole, not just the merchant affected. This is a major reason why ICS has been so actively involved with the PCI Council. How does ICS use the knowledge gained from the QIR training? Our technicians are able to immediately apply their QIR training with our customers. We not only ensure that payment applications and hardware are deployed securely for the merchant, we pass best practices on to them to help them stay secure. The assumption is never made that any merchant is an expert on the complexities of security. Instead, we ensure that they have a solid understanding of the fundamentals. Many of our customers run multiple businesses and a solid foundation of best practices means those principles can be applied everywhere. THE COMPANY Innovative Control Systems is the industry-leading provider of technology solutions for the car wash industry. Over the past 31 years, ICS’s expertise in the areas of process control, software management, and equipment automation have resulted in numerous ground-breaking products that have been sold to over 15,000 car wash sites in 32 countries spread across 5 continents.

THE PRACTITIONER Name: Nicholas Tylenda Title: Payment Card and Compliance Specialist Company: Innovative Control Systems Tenure: 9 Years As a security and compliance subject matter expert, Nick, assists with the development of training programs that prepare the support staff to service ICS’ customers while maintaining the integrity of security controls. Nick works with ICS leadership to find ways to positively influence their customers’ security and compliance initiatives through their products and services. Most importantly, he believes, as a PCIP and QIR, he helps merchants implement security best practices and understand how the PCI DSS requirements affect them. THE OUTCOME Early adoption of the QIR program allowed ICS to demonstrate leadership within its industry and serve as a regulatory expert. Brand requirements to use service providers with QIR certifications is not common knowledge for merchants. Spreading the information of the QIR program provides an opportunity for service providers to have meaningful communication with their customers. What has ICS done as a best practice related to the QIR program? ICS saw the value of the QIR program and the needs that it addressed since the beginning. We have had the benefit of certifying personnel under each major revision to the QIR program. The current iteration of the program does a great job at spotlighting the ‘big misses’ that are the greatest contributors to data breaches. Addressing these points will undoubtedly have a major positive impact in payment card security. We wanted to retain the deeper dive into other aspects of payment security the previous version of program supported with the three day training. To that end, we have developed supplemental in-house training which brings the deep dive back to our technicians. We also introduce industry- specific examples that allow our technicians to understand the concepts within a context that is immediately relevant to their job. With this extra effort ICS is able to deliver a superior service to our customers. Additionally, our customers can report that they are using a QIR to the card brands during their PCI assessments. What are the benefits to ICS of the QIR training being available as eLearning? The QIR program being available as eLearning makes it very easy for us to put our staff through the training. There are no issues trying to find a local testing center or scheduling time for the employees to be out of the office. We simply give them time during their normal day to complete the training in house. After completing the training, they are able to get right back to work applying the knowledge that they just gained.

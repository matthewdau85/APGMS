Annual Meeting Focuses on Advancing Payment Security Through Global Collaboration FORT WORTH , Texas, 18 September 2025 — More than 1,200 in-person and online stakeholders attended the PCI Security Standards Council’s (PCI SSC) North America Community Meeting, a collaborative forum for leaders in the payment security industry. The multi-day event featured discussions on 20 years of the PCI SSC’s security standards and their continued evolution, insights into best practices for leveraging artificial intelligence in payment environments, and the importance of cross-industry collaboration to defend against new and existing threats. The week kicked off with a special keynote address from the Council’s Executive Director Gina Gobeyn. The keynote focused on advancing payment security through global collaboration. The keynote was followed by a special panel discussion with industry executives sharing insights into how organizations are operationalizing trust, sharing intelligence, and navigating change together to make meaningful, lasting impacts on payment security. “We are committed more than ever to working in tandem with our stakeholders to remain steadfast against threats and keep pace with the rapid change of payment technology,” said PCI SSC Executive Director Gina Gobeyn. “We continue to invest in optimizing the way we work collaboratively with our stakeholders to ensure that we, at the Council, are more fully informed and understand the impact of change when it comes to how our industry is transforming. The North America Community Meeting is the perfect opportunity to meet face-to-face with payment security leaders and discuss the continued evolution of not only technology and payments, but also how we’re evolving at the Council to meet the needs of our stakeholders.” Deanne Zettler, Head of Product and Technology at PCI SSC, acknowledged a major part of the Council’s evolution through its transformation into a product delivery organization with a customer-centric operating model. Zettler announced the launch of seven PCI SSC product families, which encompass all 15 of the Council’s current standards and supports PCI SSC’s forward-looking standards strategy. These product families consider more than just the standard itself but also the Council’s augmented products that help put the standards into use – such as program guides, validated product and solution listing programs, supporting templates, and training – with the goal to align release plans so that all products are available at the same time, driving higher value to the PCI SSC stakeholder community. “This transformation of the Council into a dynamic, product-led organization is designed to seamlessly deliver our strategic vision – putting our stakeholders at the heart of everything we do while elevating global payment security through thoughtfully crafted release plans,” said Zettler. “This modernization journey will redefine the way our stakeholders interact with PCI SSC.” Top of mind for many in the industry is the implementation of artificial intelligence into payment environments, from automation to enhancing fraud detection. Through on-stage presentations, stakeholders discussed the benefits and risks involved with this emerging technology. “As artificial intelligence continues to evolve the way organizations across all industries work, including payment security, the Council is committed to providing resources to help organizations navigate the benefits and risks involved with adopting AI,” said Diana Greenhaw, Head of Education and Engagement at PCI SSC. “Working closely with industry leaders, our goal is to provide a balance between leveraging the benefits of AI while maintaining the high standards of security that protect payment data worldwide.” PCI SSC highlighted some of its new resources to assist the industry with this transition: PCI SSC Artificial Intelligence Resources: Visit the PCI SSC website for more information on all the PCI Council’s efforts and activities including how your organization can attend the next PCI SSC event and join the global cross-industry effort to increase payment security.

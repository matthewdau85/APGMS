USAGE OVER OPEN NETWORKS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 13 the PIN change or issuance function. These credentials should be time bound and unique per PIN change or delivery event. In summary these principles are illustrated below. Figure 3.3.1A - Preferred model for Issuer assigned PIN issuance/change Figure 3.3.2B - Preferred model for customer selected PIN change IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 3 PIN USAGE OVER OPEN NETWORKS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 14 Risk and security26 Cardholder PIN change and delivery should only be performed using an Issuer approved device (see clause 3.6) and functionality, and should follow the recommendations set out below:27 PIN change and delivery should adhere to the principles set out in ISO 9564 (all parts) to the maximum extent possible consistent with the Issuer's security and risk management policies;28 PIN selection should not be performed using mail (traditional post or otherwise), unless specifically authorised in the IAC Code Set;29 PIN change and delivery should ensure that the plain text PIN is never be known to, or accessible by, any employee or agent of the Issuer;30 PIN change and delivery should only be initiated by the Cardholder; the host SCM functionality that is used to implement customer select PIN change should be atomic, that is, verification of the Cardholder using the current PIN or account specific control number should be an intrinsic part of that functionality. Specifically, an SCM function that accepts a new PIN and a PAN and that outputs an offset and/or PVV for storage in a host database should not exist unless it additionally embodies strong Cardholder authentication as per clause3.3.3; the PIN change and delivery process should ensure the authenticity of the Cardholder;31 a detailed risk assessment paying particular attention to any deviations from the relevant standards – [AS2805.14, ISO 9564, ISO 13491] - should be an integral part of any Issuer’s decision to provide functionality in support of PIN change and delivery over open networks; 32 to assist with fraud monitoring and problem resolution, Issuers should record PIN change and delivery events including date, time, frequency and the channel over which the event occurred (without recording any PINs); and33 the Open Network PIN change/delivery system should not be the sole PIN change or delivery mechanism available to Cardholders. 26 Last amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 27 Last amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 28 Amended effective 21/11/16, version 004 r&p 002.16 29 Amended effective 29/4/16, version 003 r&p 001.16 30 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 31 Amended effective 29/4/16, version 003 r&p 001.16 32 Last amended effective 21/11/16, version 004 r&p 002.16 33 Amended effective 29/4/16, version 003 r&p 001.16 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 3 PIN USAGE OVER OPEN NETWORKS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 15 Cardholder authentication 34 Issuers should:35 provide Cardholders with a means to determine that the dialogue with the Issuer is genuine; ensure that Cardholder authentication credentials are not based on information that is publicly available; ensure that the Cardholder's card number cannot be determined solely from the Cardholder's authentication credentials; ensure that it is not possible to authenticate a Cardholder using only information contained on the card or other payment instrument; not transmit the PAN to the Cardholder during a PIN change or delivery operation, nor require that the Cardholder enter such information; implement a policy to never send unsolicited PIN change requests and advise Cardholders accordingly; use calling-line identification only as a confirmation, not proof, of a Cardholder's identity, and to implement additional Cardholder authentication; ensure that PIN change or delivery systems requiring the transmission of the PIN over open networks provide mutual assurance to the Issuer and Cardholder that the correct PIN is being delivered to, or from, the genuine Cardholder e.g., using a separate channel to deliver acknowledgements; avoid the use of the card PIN for non-payment transactions including access to electronic banking;36 acknowledge PIN change and delivery requests back to the Cardholder using an out-of-band mechanism i.e., through the use of two separate networks working simultaneously to authenticate a user; pay particular attention to device convergence resulting from technological change in selecting acceptable out-of-band mechanisms e.g., browser capable smartphones; manage the risks associated with possible redirection of PIN change request or delivery acknowledgements through, for example, phone number porting; provide Cardholders with the means to audit the outcome of a PIN change or delivery request; and 34 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 35 Amended effective 29/4/16, version 003 r&p 001.16 36 Amended effective 29/4/16, version 003 r&p 001.16 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 3 PIN USAGE OVER OPEN NETWORKS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 16 ensure that no staff member can legitimately associate a control number with a card number or account. 3.4 Recommendations for PIN advice (assigned or derived PIN) over open networks37 Methods of conveying the PIN 38 Issuer approved methods of conveying the PIN to the Cardholder should follow the recommendations set out below:39 the plain text PIN should never be transmitted over communications lines outside of a secure environment as specified in AS 2805.14.2:2009, clause H.5, unless there is no feasible way in which the PIN could be associated with the Cardholder, the Cardholder's account or card; the Issuer's employees, staff and agents should

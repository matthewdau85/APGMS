Carly’s Coffee Couriers was one of the first businesses to advertise PayID as a payment method soon after it launched in 2018. But for Carly, PayID represents so much more than a way to receive instant and easy payments. Carly’s Coffee Couriers is a coffee delivery business. Customers of the service text in their coffee and drink orders and can pay for them using PayID. Soon after the order is placed, Carly, or a member of her fast-growing team, delivers the order (made at local cafes in partnership with Carly) with a friendly smile. It’s a mission-based business set up by Carly and her mum Leone Bishop. Carly has a moderate intellectual disability, with great verbal and reading communication and a love for getting out and about in her community. “PayID helps my business because it reduces the change I need to work out, making the delivery quick and easy. And my customers can check that the payment has gone through before I leave their workplace,” said Carly. According to Carly’s assistant Sam Thompson-Thiering, PayID has been a game changer for Carly because it helps her run her business independently and with confidence. “PayID reduces money handling and banking for Carly. It also means she can make her deliveries independently, without having to be shadowed. It has been mind-blowing for her business,” said Sam. With PayID’s help, Carly’s business has continued to grow. She now employs four people with similar disabilities to deliver coffees in and around Stocklands, Shellharbour and Wollongong in New South Wales, Australia.

Printer friendly version (PDF 0.3 MB) What is a Government Gazette? A government gazette is an official publication used to publicly notify the actions and decisions of the government. All Australian governments (Commonwealth, State and Territory) publish official gazettes. History of the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette The Commonwealth of Australia Gazette evolved from a single printed publication to a wide range of separate Gazettes, most of which are now only published electronically. From 1901 until 1973 the Gazette was published as a single weekly publication that included General Gazettes, Periodic Gazettes, and Special Gazettes. Before 1940, this included the publication in full of territory ordinances, including those for the ACT and the Northern Territory. By 1974 the weekly Gazette had become so large and unwieldy that it was decided to split it into four separate gazettes: the Government Notices Gazette, Periodic Notices Gazette, Special Notices Gazette and Australian Public Service Gazette. Since 1974 the General Gazette and the Periodic Notices Gazette have been further split into separate Gazettes for specific topics and agencies. These Gazettes include Gazettes for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), Tariff Concessions, Chemicals, Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA), and Food Standards.

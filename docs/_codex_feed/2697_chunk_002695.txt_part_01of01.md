22 − Have the latest version of the corporate virus-protection software and definition files. − Have the latest approved security patches installed. − Are configured to prevent users from disabling security controls.  Ensure the PCI security training (Requirement 12.6.2) for home workers conducting card-not-present (CNP) transactions addresses their responsibility to maintain the physical security controls for their telephony, IT systems, and work environments. 5.2 Additional Risks and Guidance in Complex Telephone Environments Implementing and maintaining PCI DSS requirements within a complex telephone environment can be particularly challenging. Potentially high volumes of payment card account data are received in clear and handled by staff. This data may be stored in audible format. Data will be transmitted and processed across various networks with service providers using telephony-specialized technologies, making the evaluation of the PCI DSS scope difficult. It is important to note that a system is considered “in scope” regardless of the volume of payment information it handles. An essential activity for each business is therefore to evaluate the risks for its own telephone environment. The use of a telephone service provider to route voice traffic to the organization should be included in any risk assessment the entity may perform. Some of the typical risk areas associated with telephone-payment environments include:  IT networks and telephony systemse.g., switches, interactive voice response (IVR) systems, network directory services, DNS, DHCP  Physical environment used by all personnel, be they agents, customer service representatives, and/or operators  Voice and screen recordings  Technologies or services used to reduce scope if they are not taken into the scope themselves 5.2.1 Securing IT Infrastructure One of the first areas of consideration is the internal IT infrastructure that supports the telephone calls and their associated payments. This includes the telephony equipment such as switches, internal legacy telephony and VoIP networks, and IVRs, as well as devices providing general network services, such as network directory services, DNS, DHCP, etc. As with any IT network, there is risk of unauthorized external and internal access; any technologies used to store, process, or transmit account data, and any networks connected to those technologies, must therefore be appropriately secured. The risks of interception of VoIP and "traditional network" traffic are the same. The difference is that VoIP traffic needs to be rendered audible to be exploited, and it is harder to look for patterns associated to CHD without listening to the traffic. The following controls are highlighted:  Maintain systems to secure configuration standards and regularly test for vulnerabilities.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 23  Implement physical and logical controls for wired data networks, wireless data networks, and internal telephony VoIP networks.  Segment in-scope systems from other networkse.g., the “Finance/HR/Other” areas of the business shown in the telephone environment diagrams aboveto prevent unauthorized access to the network and CHD.  Disable network services that are not needed across all in scope system components—for example, IVR systems are often shipped with all network services enabled, some of which may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could allow unauthorized access to the system. Disabling network services that are not required for IVR functionality or for business purposes helps reduce the risk of vulnerability. Examples of common services that are often enabled by the vendor but may not be needed include Telnet, FTP, NTP, and send mail.  Ensure proper user authentication is implemented for all personnel, including staff, agents, administrators, and any third parties.  Use strong cryptography to protect any CHD that is storedfor example, in audio recordings or in a databaseor otherwise render the stored data unreadablefor example, via truncation or hashing. Sensitive authentication data (SAD) must not be stored after authorization, even if encrypted. This applies even where there is no PAN in the environment.  Restrict access to call-recording and CRM data containing CHD to only those with a business need.  Establish and maintain access logs tracking the user’s log-in account and corporate role.  Use strong cryptography to secure transmission of any sensitive payment card data over public networks. Examples of transmissions that need to be secured include but are not limited to: − Wired and wireless networks used by at-home/remote agents and supervisors. − Any public network segments used to carry or send screen or voice recordings containing payment card data. − Voice or data streams (i.e., VoIP telephone systems) containing CHD sent over open or public networks. Examples of open, public networks include but are not limited to the Internet, wireless technologies such as 802.11 and Bluetooth, cellular technologies, and satellite communications.  Configure firewalls and network controls to prevent unauthorized transmissions of call-recording data to any network segment or device without a legitimate business need to access this data.  Never send CHD over an unencrypted, end-user messaging medium such as chat, social media, SMS (short message service)/text, or e-mail, or other non-encrypted communication channel.  Ensure that systems such as IVR, for example, do not output cardholder data in any logs.  For the home/remote worker supported as an extension of the entity’s network, make sure that their environment is secure in accordance with the PCI DSS and any controls agreed with your acquirer or payment card brand.

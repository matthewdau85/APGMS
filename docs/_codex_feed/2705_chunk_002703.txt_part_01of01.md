In an automated pause-and-resume solution, the agent no longer has the burden of remembering to manually stop and restart the recording, as the solution will automatically perform this function as part of a predefined step during the transaction process. For example, the technology could set the recording to automatically pause when the agent clicks on a payment-entry field or launches a payment screen within the application, and automatically resume when the agent clicks “submit” or moves to the next screen in the application. The effectiveness of an automated solution relies largely on its integration with the agent’s workflow process and the agent performing the correct steps at the correct time. If any ability exists for the agent to bypass the integrated process, the pause-and-resume technology could be circumvented and rendered ineffective. 6.5.2 Outsourcing to a Specialist Third-party Service Provider Outsourcing to a PCI DSS validated third-party service provider may be considered as another option for securing telephone environments. Please refer to section 7 in this document for further guidance. 6.5.3 Physical Segmentation Some organizations may choose to implement call center segmentation. This can be achieved by separating calls associated with payments from other types of calls through the use of a secure room. The physical segmentation approach can be valid to deal with “exceptions” even when technology to prevent spoken card data is deployed. It can also be deployed within a simple telephone environment.

Many other types of configuration can be implemented, and this diagram is only presented as an illustration of one of them. Beyond the network protection and isolation measures, the following controls are based on PCI DSS requirements for (a) physical access to payment card data, and (b) and monitoring. Some areas, such as the use of employees’ personal devices, are internal policy. 6.5.3.1 Physical controls  The room is a secure physical area where payment details are taken over the telephone and processed.  Physical access to the secure room is limited, controlled and monitored.  Physical access rights are granted based on individual job function, regularly reviewed, and revoked immediately upon termination.  The customer service representative (CSR) must use one or two authentication factorse.g., token, swipe card, personal codethrough an access-control device to enter the room (note that while PCI DSS Requirement 9.1 mandates only one authentication factor, using multi- factor authentication is considered best practice).  Physical access is monitored using an access-control mechanism or a video camera (or both), and the records are stored for at least three months unless legal restrictions apply.  The access-control and monitoring systems must be protected against tampering or disabling.  Any workstation in the secure room is locked to prevent unauthorized use.  The CSR is not allowed to take into the room personal electronic devices; any pens and paper are replaced with personal whiteboards and dry-wipe marker pens.  The room has no printing facilities beyond the payment terminal/POS receipts. 6.5.3.2 Procedural controls  To enforce compliance, the CSR in the non-restricted area is not allowed to receive cardholder data from the customers.  At the point of transaction, the CSR either transfers the call to a CSR in the secure room (potentially leaving the PBX in scope for PCI) or informs the customer that they will call them back.  The secure room CSR either calls the customer back through a separate VoIP or POTS connection or picks up the call, which is transferred from the PBX to the secure room.  When in possession of the card data, the secure-room CSR processes the payment via a payment terminal or a virtual terminal connected to a payment service provider. Following this, the CSR can record the transaction details on the CRM system (not represented) and securely dispose of or file any paper record or receipt Information Supplement • Protecting Telephone-Based Payment Card Data • November 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

A few examples: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the European Union data-protection and privacy regulation; the U.S. Federal Act, Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), also known as the "Digital Telephony Act"; the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK regulates banks, mutual societies, and financial advisers to protect customers and promote fair competition. An example of impact on merchants is that those using DTMF masking/suppression for their telephone payments may also be required to accept some telephone payments verbally to support customers with disabilities or who are otherwise unable to pay by pressing their telephone keypad. Entities with these obligations will need to implement appropriate processes and technologies to secure all account data that is received verbally by

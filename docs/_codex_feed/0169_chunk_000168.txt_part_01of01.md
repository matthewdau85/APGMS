remains substantial scope to improve the average cost of cross-border payments for customers in Australia.” Based on their survey results, the ACCC has further released a draft update to its Best Practice Guidance , which now includes recommendations that IMT suppliers: deduct fees from the amount inserted. This includes both in the FX calculator and in the backend of transactions, to ensure consumers are not misled as to how transactions are processed or the amounts that will be received prominently display the estimated time a transfer will take to reach its destination. This should be as accurate as possible and relevant to every corridor the supplier offers provide customers the ability to track the status of their payment. The ACCC advises that the Best Practice Guidance remains voluntary. However, they strongly encourage all IMT suppliers to implement the recommendations. The ACCC will continue its advocacy on this issue and will follow up with industry and government if there is non-adherence. If non-adherence is persistent, Government may consider a mandatory code. CPMI survey results In June, CPMI published Steady as we go: results of the 2023 CPMI cross-border payments monitoring survey , highlighting the complexity required to deliver on the G20’s Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-Border Payments. It also notes the successes, such as expanded interest in FPS interlinking and migration to ISO 20022, as well as RTGS payment systems operators undertaking to review their operating hours. Progress of G20 goals in Australia Australia, too, is making inroads into achieving the G20s goal of faster, cheaper, transparent and accessible cross-border payments. August and September were busy months for ANZ , CBA and NAB who have all announced that they now utilise the New Payments Platforms’ (NPP) International Payments Service (IPS) for the settlement of the final domestic leg of an inbound international payments (to another Australian bank that is also on NPP), allowing consumers and businesses to receive funds to their account faster. This aligns fully with the G20 roadmap for improving cross-border payments, with customers being paid their funds from overseas in a matter of minutes, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Similarly, Project Nexus, a platform designed to standardise how domestic Fast Payment Systems (FPS) connect to each another, has completed Phase Three and is now embarking on Phase Four, which will allow participants to work towards seamlessly connecting their instant payment systems. In Phase Four, Bank Negara Malaysia, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Bank of Thailand and their domestic FPS operators will be joined by the Reserve Bank of India. This expands the user base to India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI), the world's largest FPS. Other ASEAN members who are party to the Regional Payment Connectivity MoU (Brunei, Laos and Vietnam) will likely join Phase Four at a later stage. In July, the Pacific Banking Forum in Brisbane saw significant commitments from participating correspondent banks to provide technical feedback on the proposed World Bank project and to engage Pacific Island governments and respondent banks to consider strengthening cross border remittances through the region, in line with countries’ enhancements of their AML/CFT frameworks and regional uplift of safe and sustainable banking sectors. This will involve a significant level of technical assistance being provided by both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund that seeks to enable continuous access to correspondent banking services in the participating Pacific Island countries. Stablecoins Stablecoins continue to garner interest and traction in the mainstream financial sector. The FSB has published a paper, Cross-border Regulatory Issues of Global Stablecoin Arrangements in EMDE . This paper highlights the potential fragility of stablecoins that are not adequately designed and regulated, particularly in terms of additional risks and challenges to which some emerging market and developing economies (EMDE) may be exposed. This issue was emphasised by the FSB Chair’s letter to the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting in July. Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation We also acknowledge the 10th anniversary of the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF). The FSB established GLEIF in June 2014, in the wake of the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2007-2009, with a mission to provide transparency in global financial transactions and to reinstate trust, one of the key lessons learned from the GFC. Today, GLEIF maintains the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), a 20-character alpha-numeric code that serves as an international ID for businesses. Implementation of the LEI has increased regulators’ ability to evaluate systemic and emerging risk, identify trends and take corrective steps. It continues to evolve with a position that broad adoption will generate advantages for the wider business community. We look forward to continuing to work with you through 2024.

compensating controls as soon as possible that mitigate the risk of continuing with the non-compliant process or data exchange—while work continues on its remediation.  Prepare a remediation plan that can be provided to the entity or the TPSP in a form that can be used as evidence (e.g., Compensating Controls Worksheet) to provide a QSA if a PCI DSS compliance review is due within the remediation timeframe.  Ensure any nested TPSPs meet the agreed obligations with regard to remediating the non- compliant issue and keeps the TPSPs informed of progress. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 34 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 Appendix A: High-Level Discussion Points for Determining Responsibility These high-level suggestions and discussion points may help clarify how responsibilities for PCI DSS requirements may be shared between an entity and its TPSP(s). Entities should consider defining these responsibilities in written agreements with TPSPs. The table in this Appendix may also help in completing a detailed PCI DSS responsibility matrix (sample in Appendix B) and determining who will be responsible for each control area. The table consists of the following fields:  Steps to Determine Responsibility: High-level control areas that may cover multiple PCI DSS requirements and a starting point for discussion between the entity and its TPSP.  Discussion Points: High-level discussion points for each control area. These recommendations are for discussion between the entity and the TPSP to assist in understanding the control areas and allocating the responsibilities in each.  Entity or Third Party: These columns may be used to track responsibility for each control area for the services being provided, any discussion items that need follow-up, or whether the control area is a shared responsibility.  Evidence to be Provided: This column may be used to document evidence to be provided per the mutual agreement by the TPSP and the entity to support the entity’s validation in meeting the control area. For the full PCI DSS and related documents, please see the PCI SSC website https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/documents.php. Note: This Appendix is intended as guidance only and is for optional use at the discretion of the entity and/or TPSP; completion of this Appendix is not a requirement. The allocation of responsibilities between an entity and its TPSP(s) ultimately will depend on the specific facts and circumstances and services provided. Although the items in this Appendix may be useful in helping to allocate responsibilities between an entity and its TPSPs, the list of items and discussion points in this Appendix is not exhaustive. Each organization seeking to engage a TPSP must determine what is relevant in light of the circumstances, the organization’s payment environment, the proposed TPSP’s role, and other factors determined to be important through thorough due diligence.

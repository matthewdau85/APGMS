agreements. 5.1 Agreements between PCI DSS Compliant Third-Party Service Providers versus non-PCI DSS Compliant Third-Party Service Providers TPSPs that have undergone PCI DSS compliance assessment and are validated as compliant: When engaging a TPSP that claims its services are PCI DSS compliant, entities should consider documenting such compliance. The specific documentation that may be provided will ultimately depend on the situation and agreement between the parties, and may include provision of an AOC, SAQ, and/or relevant sections from the ROC (redacted to protect any confidential information), including:  Date of compliance assessment  System components, services, and environments that were included in the third-party PCI DSS assessment  System components and services that were excluded from the PCI DSS assessment, as applicable to the service(s) provided Having the TPSP resources available (including ISA or QSA if required) to answer any clarification questions may be useful in validating that the services provided by the TPSP are covered. Similarly, provisions acknowledging the respective responsibilities of the parties for handling and securing the CHD in their possession in a PCI DSS compliant manner may assist in validation.

TPSPs that have not undergone an assessment or are not required to validate PCI DSS compliance: An entity that is required to establish PCI DSS compliance and that utilize the services of a TPSP that has not affirmatively established its own PCI DSS compliance may need to cover some or all of the TPSP’s environment as a part of its own PCI DSS assessments. More specifically, such an entity’s PCI DSS assessment will need to cover any TPSP service that requires (or may enable or permit) the TPSP to handle CHD or can impact the security of the CDE. As a result, entities seeking to engage TPSPs in this context may wish to consider mechanisms (such as the ability to audit the TPSP) intended to help promote transparency and assist in the PCI DSS compliance validation process, such as:  Access to systems, facilities, and appropriate personnel for on-site reviews, interviews, physical walk- throughs, etc.  Review of TPSP policies, procedures, process documentation, configuration standards, training records, incident response plans, etc. that evidence satisfaction of applicable PCI DSS requirements and/or requirements that the TPSP adhere to the entity’s policy.  Review of evidence (such as configurations, screen shots, process reviews, etc.) to assist in validating that all applicable PCI DSS requirements are being met for the in-scope system components of the TPSP environment.  Clarity regarding portions of the merchant environment managed by the TPSP that are in scope for the entity/merchant PCI DSS assessment.  Retention of evidence collected because of non-compliance  Allocation of responsibility for handling and securing cardholder data in a PCI DSS compliant manner.  Frequency of PCI DSS compliance validation/assessment (e.g., annually, quarterly, etc.). 5.2 Considerations when Building Agreements, Policies, and Procedures Regional Regulatory Requirements It is recommended that an entity evaluate all regional (e.g., country, state, provincial, municipal) requirements that may apply. For example, some merchants, such as state agencies or public universities, may be required to comply with state-specific requirements regarding specific issues (such as budget-cycle dependence for payment) or selection of a TPSP. An entity should consult appropriate federal, regional, state (e.g., state controller), local, and foreign agencies to determine applicable limitations and guidelines. 9 This reference is to PCI DSS v3.1 – April 2015 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 22 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 Legislative Considerations An entity may want to consult applicable laws that may contain additional provisions regarding:  Definitions of sensitive or protected information  Breach-notification thresholds  Specific identity-theft protection requirements  Enhanced protection requirements for specific categories of sensitive or other data These provisions may vary from an entity’s typical policy or agreement. The entity should seek legal consultation regarding all applicable legal, regulatory, and other requirements for each jurisdiction, area, and region in which it will be operating. The value of understanding and allocating responsibility for meeting all such requirements cannot be understated, especially in the location(s) where physical and virtual payment environments reside. Acquirer Considerations Each acquirer may have its own requirements related to engaging a TPSP. An entity may want to review its agreements with acquirers to ensure its TPSPs (or the acquirers’ TPSP(s)) are meeting any additional acquirer-specific responsibilities that flow through to TPSPs. Payment Card Brand Considerations Each payment card brand has created its own compliance programs. Entities seeking to engage TPSPs should consider reviewing these compliance-program requirements with the TPSP(s) in order to identify and appropriately allocate corresponding responsibilities, and to ensure that each understands and complies with all applicable payment card brand mandates. Industry-Specific Considerations In various industries and verticals there are specific industry regulations and requirements that entities might consider, as they may be important to the relationship and the allocation of rights and responsibilities between an entity and a TPSP. Specific issues to consider may include the handling of equipment that is part

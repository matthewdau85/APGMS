payment. It enhances fraud risk scoring systems that enable risk-based payment holds and targeted interventions by trained staff. Westpac's ‘Verify’ system exemplifies intelligent questioning that leverages behavioural science. As of August 2024, this system had challenged 200,000 payments, resulting in A$194 million in abandoned (likely fraudulent) transactions. Westpac’s ‘Verify’ was also preventing 300 mistaken payments daily ( 4 ). 3. Transparency and accountability This principle promotes embedding end-user safety into organisational culture through appropriate staff training and practices. It requires PSPs and/or payment system operators to be transparent by publishing metrics that demonstrate product performance against safety objectives, and to foster continuous improvement. Australia has cultivated a culture of developing and sharing risk mitigants across industry. The National Anti-Scam Centre, the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange and other forums, such as the Economic Crime Forum, are prime examples. But the next phase is global coordination. There is work underway and a drive to make scams a G20 priority to overcome global data sharing and coordination challenges. Strengthening the foundations The digital payments landscape continues to evolve, with agentic AI-driven ecommerce and cross-border interlinking of fast payment systems. Each development presents both opportunities and risks. Products within the digital economy must be designed to encompass the three foundational principles of privacy, security and safety, forming the trinity of design. Importantly, SbD offers a framework for navigating this complex environment. By embedding safety considerations into the development process, payments systems will retain their utility while continuing to be innovative, secure and safe. The choice for the digital economy is clear. Continue playing catch-up with criminals who exploit system vulnerabilities, and face an increasingly onerous regulatory burden, or proactively design systems that make exploitation significantly harder and that are safe for consumers. Given the risk of lost funds, damaged trust, lost productivity and reduced innovation, the cost of inaction is simply too high. In an increasingly connected global payments ecosystem, SbD isn't just a nice-to-have feature; together with privacy and security, it must become the foundation upon which the future of digital finance is built and maintained.

Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 42 AusPayNet September 2017 maintaining requirements of the standard for colour. That is foreground printing must be printed as scan readable and background printing must be printed as scan non-readable. See also Appendix A. 4. Butts and Payment Advices Butts and payment advices are often attached to cheques providing the payee with details of the payment. The preferred position for butts/payment advices is above or to the left of the cheque or deposit form. The right hand and bottom edges of cheques /deposits are critical for the sorting equipment utilised by Financial Institutions, therefore these must be clean reference edges. If it is necessary however to place the attachments to the right or bottom edge of a document then the quality of perforations is critical. It must be possible for the payee to easily remove the attachment, leaving a clean reference edge. See also Section 5. The words "ADVICE TO PAYEE" and "DETACH BEFORE BANKING" must be clearly marked on any butts/payment advices. 5. Perforations, Edge Notching and Holes in Documents Slit type perforations and micro-perforations (also known as clean edge) are the only acceptable perforation. Other perforations such as pinhole lead to build up of paper fluff and can cause clogging of the reader/sorter equipment. Printed perforation marks in magnetic ink or toner are not permitted within the MICR clear band. However, it is permitted to use ordinary (non-magnetic) ink, but not toner, at scan non- readable levels within this area. It is recommended that when documents are folded for insertion into mailing envelopes, one fold be made on the cross perforation. Such folding weakens the perforation and facilitates the removal of the document undamaged. Folds close to the perforation can result in damage to the document which can cause processing difficulties. 5.1 Continuous Stationery Documents produced in continuous form must have selvedges removed before distribution. Cutting devices used for the removal of selvedges and for document separation must allow for the correct positioning of any encoding in relation to the reference edges of the document and give clean edges. When the selvedge on continuous deposit forms is not perforated, guide marks must be provided to indicate the correct guillotining position. 5.2 Edge Notching and Holes In Documents Documents must not be produced with notches or other types of indentation on any edge, or contain holes of any shape or size, as these cause the documents to interlock and jam the processing equipment. 5.3 Binding The application of glues, or other forms of binding, is not permitted on the right hand and bottom reference edges on any document. Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 43 AusPayNet September 2017 6. Security Australian Courts have ruled that the drawer of a negotiable document owes a duty to the Financial Institution to exercise reasonable care in the drawing of the document, taking into account the possibility that others will break the law. Financial Institutions are concerned that changes in technology, through the use of colour photocopiers and the ready accessibility of sophisticated printing equipment, has increased the incidence of counterfeiting and the forging and/or altering of cheques. There is therefore a need for the proper protection of the finance industry's negotiable documents. The background must be printed to afford protection against fraudulent alteration by reaction to chemical or physical alteration. Paragraph amended (editorial changes), effective 28/06/04 Paragraphs deleted, effective 02/2001 Protection against counterfeiting and fraudulent alteration of cheques is obtained by choosing the right combination of security features. The choice of good security features protects corporate identity and reputation, minimises monetary loss and eliminates the inconvenience and time spent investigating fraud. Paragraph amended (editorial changes), effective 28/06/04 AusPayNet recognises security printers by issuing them with a Printer Identifier. Recognised security printers are either corporate or commercial printers. Commercial printers print their own base stock while corporate printers MICR in-house or carry out printing on behalf of others using pre-printed base stock Amended, effective 19/05/08 Cheques printed by recognised security printers who understand the importance of the security features detailed in this publication, and which are printed under controlled conditions, offer the best solution available. Recognised security printers also ensure that cheques are printed to enable clear recognition of all variable details as required by Financial Institutions for image capture and processing. Last three paragraphs inserted, effective 02/2001 6. 1 Security Features Section 6.1 has been rearranged (re-numbered) and parts of the text amended. Effective 28/06/04 There are four levels of security for the printing of documents, dependent on their risk level. The number of security features to be used increases with the risk level and are to be selected from the list given in Section 6.2. The levels of security cover the minimum security features that are required to protect the document type from forgery or counterfeiting. It may be considered desirable to add to these minimum levels to further improve protection of the document.

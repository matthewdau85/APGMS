other information you may supply also may be included in publicly accessible records of our various committees, working groups, online events and discussions, and similar activities that you join, in various places, including: (i) the permanently-posted attendance and other records of those activities; (ii) documents generated by the activity, which may be permanently archived; and, (iii) along with message content, in the permanent archives of our email lists, which also may be public. Please remember that any information (including personal information) that you disclose in public areas of the Web site or in connection with public or broad participation activities, such as forums (in person or online), message boards, news groups, and other activities, may become publicly or broadly available information that others may collect, circulate, and use. Because we cannot and do not control the acts of others, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose information about yourself or others in forums or other activities such as these. Given the international scope of the PCI Security Standards Council, personal information may be visible to persons outside your country of residence, including to persons in countries that your own country’s privacy laws and regulations deem deficient in ensuring an adequate level of protection for such information. If you are unsure whether this Privacy Policy is in conflict with applicable local rules, you should not submit your information. Your Personal Data will never be used for direct marketing purposes, although we may contact you to follow up on a request you made for information about a service, event or activity we provide. If you do not want your personal information collected and used by the PCI Security Standards Council, please do not visit or use our Web site, apply for participant or member status, or engage in PCI SSC activities 10. Access to and Accuracy of Information We are committed to keeping the personal information of our participating and member organizations and other Web site users accurate. All the information you have submitted to us can be verified, changed and deleted (consistent with legal data retention requirements). In order to do this, please email us a request at dataprivacy@pcisecuritystandards.org . We may provide participants, members and/or others with online access to their own personal profiles, enabling them to update or delete information at any time. To protect your privacy and security, we also may take reasonable steps to verify identity, such as requiring a user ID and password, before access to modify personal profile data. Certain areas of the Web site may limit access to specific individuals through the use of passwords or other personal identifiers; a password prompt is your indication that a restricted resource is being accessed. 11. Security We use a variety of means to protect personal information provided by users of the Web site, including using firewalls and other security measures on its servers. No server, however, is 100% secure, and you should take this into account when submitting personal or confidential information about yourself or others on the Web site or elsewhere. Much of the personal information we collect is used in conjunction with participation and/or member-level services such as collaboration and discussion, so some types of personal information such as your name, company affiliation, and email address will be visible to other PCI Security Standards Council participants or members, and to the public. We assume no liability for the interception, alteration, use or misuse of the information you provide. You alone are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please use care when you access the Web site and otherwise provide personal information. 12. Opting Out From time to time we may email you electronic newsletters, announcements, surveys or other information. If you prefer not to receive any or all of these communications, you may opt out by following the directions provided within the electronic newsletters and announcements. 13. California Privacy Rights Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act (“CPRA”), and other California privacy laws, California residents have certain rights relating to collection, use, and sharing of their personal information for companies that meet applicable requirements. For example, if you are a resident of California, you have the right to request to know what personal information we have collected about you, and to access that information. You also have the right to request deletion of your personal information, though exceptions under the law may allow us to retain and use certain personal information notwithstanding your deletion request. For additional information regarding such rights and laws, please review our Privacy Notice for California Residents at Appendix B hereto. 14.

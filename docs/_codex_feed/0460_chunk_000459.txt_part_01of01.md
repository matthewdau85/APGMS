its SWIFT PDS System is operating again in the normal way, that Framework Participant must immediately advise: (i) the System Administrator; and (ii) if the System Administrator has issued a RITS broadcast message to all HVCS Framework Participants in respect of the problem, the Company; of the change of status. (b) If a Participant Fallback Period is in operation at the time that the Disabling Event is resolved, the Affected Participant must comply with the Contingency Instructions with respect to the continued use of the Participant Fallback Solution and reversion to the SWIFT PDS for sending payments. 9.16 RITS or CSI (Central Site) Disabling Event312 (a) Both RITS and the CSI have two processors and each can withstand the failure of one of its two processors. However, if both processors should fail the system will revert to its back-up site. Until the move to processing using that back-up site is complete all RITS processing will cease. Framework Participants forwarding SWIFT PDS payments to RITS during this period will have those payments queued in the SWIFT PDS pending recovery of RITS. 313 309 Last amended effective 14/11/22, version 041 r&p 001.22 310 Amended effective 14/11/22, version 041 r&p 001.22 311 Amended effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 312 Last amended effective 21/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 313 Last amended effective 1/1/18, version 037 r&p 001.17 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES PART 10: TRANSITION ARRANGEMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 67 (b) Technically it is possible for the CSI to fail separately from RITS. In these circumstances other payment delivery feeder systems to RITS, such as RITS, might continue to use RITS to settle payments on a Real Time Gross Settlement basis, because those payment delivery systems are unaffected by failure of the CSI. 314 9.17 Advice of RITS Central Site Failure315 The System Administrator is responsible for advising all Framework Participants, of any Disabling Event occurring at the RITS or the CSI level, and any action initiated to correct the situation including the likely time until the system will be operating as normal. Advice by the System Administrator in accordance with this Clause 9.17 will be given either by issuing a RITS broadcast message if possible or otherwise by the most expeditious means reasonably available using Framework Participant’s contact points in Annexure C.1.316 9.18 Resynchronisation of RITS Data Base317 (a) The Reserve Bank of Australia has advised that if RITS fails and the RITS data base is corrupted, that data base including Framework Participants’ ESA balances, will be recreated from separately maintained “redo logs”. However, because there may be a period of several minutes after compilation of the last redo log and the actual system failure, there is a possibility that some data on previously settled Payments may be lost. In this case the Reserve Bank of Australia will contact each Framework Participant to verify the ESA balance and associated transactions. Where a difference exists between the balance quoted by the Reserve Bank of Australia and a Framework Participant’s position, the figure quoted by the Reserve Bank of Australia will be final.318 (b) A difference in the ESA balance figure indicates that one or more previously “settled payments” have been lost and the Senders and Receivers of the payments in question will need to adjust their own figures accordingly and the Sender must re-send those payments. Framework Participants requiring further details should refer to the RITS Regulations and RITS User Handbook. 9.19 Central Communications Failure (SWIFT FIN Service)319 9.19.1 Partial Communications Failure (SWIFT FIN-Copy) (a) Standard SWIFT procedures set out in the SWIFT User Handbook will apply where the SWIFT Network or part of the SWIFT Network is experiencing difficulties. 314 Last amended effective 1/1/18, version 037 r&p 001.17 315 Last amended effective 1/1/18, version 037 r&p 001.17 316 Last amended effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 317 Last amended effective 1/1/18, version 037 r&p 001.17 318 Last amended effective 1/1/18, version 037 r&p 001.17 319 Inserted effective 20/08/04, version 014 r&p 001.04 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES PART 10: TRANSITION ARRANGEMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 68 (b) If normal SWIFT fallback arrangements fail to resolve the problem and the difficulties become protracted, the System Administrator in conjunction with the Chief Executive Officer, will notify Framework Participants of the likely extent of the problem, using the contact details set out in Annexure C.1, and action proposed. If a notice in accordance with this Clause 9.19.1(b) is issued it will be necessary for Framework Participants to consider alternative arrangements for the despatch of payments. 9.20 Failure of Both RITS and/or CSI Primary & Back-up Configurations320 (a) If a Disabling Event causes both RITS main site and back-up site to fail, or the main CSI and back-up to fail, the System Administrator will need to consider alternative means of processing payments. If the Disabling Event causes a RITS Outage the System Administrator:321 (i) could recommend to the Company that a HVCS Fallback Period be declared during which time the HVCS Fallback Solution provided for in the Contingency Instructions will apply; (ii) must notify all Framework Participants if a HVCS Fallback Period has or could be declared; and (iii) will have regard to the timings in the RITS Outage runsheet timings in the Contingency Instructions and use this as a guide for the time of day that any such decision to declare a HVCS Fallback Period may

different for each cloud service category and deployment model and will be governed by the signed contractual agreements. Customers should not make assumptions about any serviceclear policies and procedures should be agreed upon between Customer and Provider for all security requirements, and clear responsibilities for operation, management and reporting need to be defined for each requirement. The PCI Security Standards Council has published the Information Supplement Third-Party Security Assurance, which provides further guidance on implementing third-party assurance program.8 3.2 Roles and Responsibilities for Different Cloud Deployment Models The entity performing the role of Provider will vary according to the type of deployment model. For example, the Provider role may be assigned entirely to an external third party (as in a public cloud), or the role may be undertaken by an internal department or business function (as in an on-premises private cloud). Similarly, the role of Provider may be assigned to more than one entity in a community or hybrid cloud scenario. To understand how responsibilities are assigned in a particular deployment model, consider the following: ▪ Public cloud – The Provider is a third party that is organizationally separate from its Customers. The cloud is deployed within a Provider’s environment and responsibility is delineated according to the particular cloud service category, as defined by the Provider. ▪ Private cloud – Where a private cloud is managed on-premises, the Provider role may be undertaken within the Customer. For example, the IT department could take on the role of Provider with various operational departments as its Customers. In this scenario, the Customer retains full control of its environment and responsibility for its security and compliance. Dedicated, private clouds may also be provisioned off-premises by a third-party Provider. In this case, the delineation of responsibility will also depend on the particular cloud service category, as described in Section 3.3, “Responsibilities for Different Cloud Service Categories.” ▪ Hybrid cloud – The Provider role may be assigned to both internal and third-party entities for different elements of the overall cloud infrastructure. Responsibility will be assigned based on the combination of deployment models and cloud service categories implemented. ▪ Community cloud – The Provider could be one of the Customers within the community or a separate third party. The delineation of responsibility follows the particular cloud service category implemented. The responsibility for implementation, operation and management of security controls will be shared differently within each of the cloud service categories and needs to be clearly understood by both the Customer and Provider. The Customer also needs to understand the level of oversight or visibility it will have into security functions that are outside its control. If these security responsibilities are not properly 8 Third-Party Security Assurance and Shared Responsibilities Special Interest Groups and PCI Security Standards Council, Third-Party Security Assurance (PCI SSC, March 2016), https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/ThirdPartySecurityAssurance_March2016_FINAL.pdf.

Any cloud deployment model that is not fully self-managed is by nature a shared responsibility model, where a portion of responsibility for the cloud service falls under the realm of the Provider (see Section 3.4, “Nested Service Provider Relationships,” for more information), and a portion of responsibility also falls to each Customer. The level of responsibility that falls to the Provider or the Customer is determined by the cloud service category being utilizedfor example, IaaS, PaaS or SaaS. Clear delineation of responsibilities should be established as a prerequisite to any cloud service implementation to provide a baseline for the cloud operation. Table 1 illustrates how control of the different technical layers is often shared across different cloud service categories. For illustration purposes, different layers of the cloud stack are described as follows: Layer Description Application Program Interface (API) or Graphical User Interface (GUI) The interface by which cloud service users interact with the application. The current most common API is RESTful HTTP or HTTPS. The current most common GUI is an HTTP- or HTTPS-based website. Application The actual application being used by one or more cloud service users Solution Stack or Technology Stack This is the programming language used to build and deploy applications. Examples are .NET, Python, Ruby, Perl, etc. Operating Systems (OS) In a virtualized environment, the OS runs within each VM. Alternatively, if there is no underlying hypervisor present, the operating system runs directly on the storage hardware. Virtual Machine (VM)9 A virtual container executed on a hypervisor on a host. A set of system isolation technologies that provide various degree of security isolation with the host machine’s OS kernel Containers Virtualization technique that allows execution of multiple isolated user- space instances while sharing the same underlying OS kernel Virtual Network Infrastructure For communications within and between virtual machines Hypervisor When virtualization is used to manage resources, the hypervisor is responsible for allocating resources to each virtual machine. It may also be leveraged for implementing security. 9 Providers will often distinguish between Paravirtual (PV) and

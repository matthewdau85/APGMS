to be ‘on-premise’. As a machine credential custodian, you can only upload your credential to a cloud tenancy that remains in the exclusive use and control of your company. Digital Service Provider and Operational Security Framework DSPs are required to undertake ATO’s DSP Operational Security Framework (OSF) to access ATOs Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and use their machine credential to sign transactions on behalf of their clients. The OSF is the ATO’s approach to recognise and respond to risks posed by exposure of ATO client data through APIs. What your users need to know The information and advice you give to your users will vary depending on their technical knowledge. If your users hold business appointments within Access Manager to report on behalf of other businesses, these permissions are not automatically applied to a machine credential. Once they have used the credential for the first time via an SBR transmission, they will need to log into Access Manager and assign the appropriate permissions to the credential. This will be necessary whenever a new machine credential is installed.

QSA Companies and their QSA Employees’ responsibilities in connection with the Program include, but are not limited to, the following:  Adhering to the QSA Qualification Requirements and this Program Guide.  Maintaining knowledge of and ensuring adherence to current and relevant PCI DSS guidance and instructions located in the Document Library section of the Website.  Performing PCI DSS Assessments in accordance with the PCI DSS, including but not limited to: o Validating and confirming Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) scope as defined by the assessed entity. o Selecting employees, facilities, systems, and system components accurately representing the assessed environment if sampling is employed. o Being on-site at assessed entity during the PCI DSS Assessment. o Evaluating compensating controls as applicable. o Providing an opinion about whether the assessed entity meets PCI DSS Requirements. o Effectively using the PCI DSS ROC Reporting Template to produce Reports on Compliance. o Validating and attesting as to an entity’s PCI DSS compliance status. o Maintaining documents, workpapers, and interview notes that were collected during the PCI DSS Assessment and used to validate the findings. o Applying and maintaining independent judgement in all PCI DSS Assessment decisions. o Conducting follow-up assessments, as needed. o Stating whether or not the assessed entity has achieved compliance with PCI DSS. PCI SSC does not approve ROCs from a technical perspective, but performs QA reviews on ROCs to ensure that the documentation of testing procedures performed is sufficient to support the results of the PCI DSS Assessment. See Section 8, “Assessor Quality Management,” for additional information. Note: While the Primary Contact’s role includes helping facilitate and coordinate with PCI SSC regarding administrative or technical questions, Primary Contacts as well as QSA Companies and Assessor-Employees are strongly encouraged to check the FAQs published on the Website prior to contacting PCI SSC with questions.

Page 7 1052300.5 6 Qualification Process In an effort to help ensure that each QSA Company and Assessor-Employee possesses the requisite knowledge, skills, experience, and capacity to perform PCI DSS Assessments in a proficient manner and in accordance with industry expectations, each company and individual desiring to perform PCI DSS Assessments must be qualified by PCI SSC as a QSA Company or QSA Employee (as applicable), and then must maintain that qualification in Good Standing. In order to achieve qualification as a QSA Company, the candidate company and at least one of its employees must satisfy all QSA Requirements (defined in the QSA Qualification Requirements) applicable to QSA Companies and QSA Employees. All such QSA Companies are then identified on the QSA List on the Website, and all such QSA Employees are added to the Website’s search tool. When a QSA Company has been active for at least two years, it is eligible to apply to join the Associate QSA Program and, accordingly, to apply to qualify eligible employees as Associate QSA Employees. Refer to Section 6.2 for more information on the Associate QSA Program. Only those QSA Companies and QSA Employees qualified by PCI SSC and included in the QSA List or Website search tool (as applicable) are recognized by PCI SSC to perform PCI DSS Assessments. Associate QSA Employees may assist in the performance of PCI DSS Assessments as further described in this document. 6.1 Requalification All QSA Companies must be requalified regionally by PCI SSC on an annual basis. The annual QSA Company requalification date is based upon the QSA Company’s original qualification date (on a per- region basis). QSA Company requalification requires payment of annual training and regional requalification fees, as well as continued compliance with applicable QSA Requirements. Each Assessor-Employee (QSA Employee and Associate QSA Employee, as applicable) must be requalified by PCI SSC on an annual basis. The annual requalification date is based upon the Assessor-Employee’s previous qualification date. Assessor-Employee requalification requires proof of applicable Continuing Professional Education

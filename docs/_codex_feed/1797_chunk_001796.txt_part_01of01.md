Australian Payments Plus is delighted to announce our inaugural payments and identity summit Beyond Tomorrow , to be held at ICC Sydney on Wednesday, 13 March 2024. The Summit will see AP+ move into its third year as an operating entity. In February 2022, Australia’s domestic payments companies BPAY Group, eftpos and NPP Australia came together to shape the future of payments in Australia. We partner with more than 150 organisations across Australia’s payments ecosystem, and in our first year of operation, processed 3.9 billion transactions. We have a clear vision - to drive innovation in Australia’s payments ecosystem so that Australian businesses, government and consumers experience more benefits, in more ways. While much has been achieved including the continued success of our legacy solutions like BPAY and eftpos, the launch of our identity verification solution, ConnectID, and the growth of newer offerings such as PayID and PayTo, we continue to look ahead to create more value, and enable more progress for Australia. We’re inspired by what’s possible today and want to navigate the future of Australia’s digital economy with you at Beyond Tomorrow . Beyond Tomorrow will bring together speakers and delegates from across the payments and identity industries, business and government to focus on our collective goal to inspire trust in the digital economy among across Australia. MCd by Nine Network News and Entertainment Presenter, Brooke Boney, the program will explore the themes of payments and identity. Delegates will be joined by an impressive line-up of experts and thought leaders to discover the latest trends, future developments and brilliant thinking across the payments and identity industries.

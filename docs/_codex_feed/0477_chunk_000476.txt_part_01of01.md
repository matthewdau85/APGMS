not recovered by 15:00, a Participant Fallback Period could be declared, during which time the Participant Fallback Solution can be used to send payments from the Affected Participant to Receivers. Payments to the Affected Participant must continue to go through the SWIFT PDS and will be queued in the Affected Participant’s SWIFT systems until their inward processing is restored. These payments will continue to be tested and settled in RITS as per the normal operation of the SWIFT PDS Feeder. 3) The Participant Fallback Period checkpoints are linked to RITS session times and rules. This allows Receivers to effectively manage their end of day liquidity operations and ensure they have sufficient operational staff available. 4) Outgoing payments from the Affected Participant to Receivers should be complete by the end of the RITS Settlement Close Session at 17:15. The checkpoint times and instructions regarding the frequency of bilateral clearing and settlement should enable the Affected Participant to send and settle at least one batch of payments per Receiver. Where the Affected Participant is Evening Agreed and wishes to send payments to another Evening Agreed Participant after the Settlement Close Session, the Affected Participant must obtain prior agreement from the Receiver. These payments must be complete by the Evening Settlement Cut-off. 5) Where the volume of payments the Affected Participant intends to send a Receiver exceeds the instructions on payment volumes, the Affected Participant must obtain prior agreement from the Receiver. 6) If the Affected Participant’s Disabling Event occurs after 14:00, AusPayNet in consultation with the RBA, would normally expect that a Participant Fallback Period would not be required, but would consider the value of outstanding payments in its assessment.

to expire. Members must also supply an update on the progress of remediation, in accordance with project plans submitted to AusPayNet. A.8. What are the key rotation intervals for Key Encryption Keys (KEK) and Session keys used in Interchange Links? IAC Code Set Volume 4, Section 4.5.2 (b): “Key Encrypting Keys must be changed at the request of the Interchange partner, or, as a minimum, once every two years” and “Session Keys must be changed, as a minimum, once every 2048 Transactions or once an hour, whichever occurs first” A.9. What is the difference between Interchange Links and Interchange Lines? “Interchange Line” means the physical (including wireless) communications infrastructure that provides the medium over which Interchange Activity is supported. An Interchange Line contains, at a minimum, one Interchange Link. “Interchange Link” means the logical link between an Acquirer and an Issuer which facilitates Interchange Activity between them. Interchange Links are supported physically by an Interchange Line, and are either direct between an Acquirer and Issuer or indirect via a third party intermediary. A.10. Is it acceptable to use a KEK hierarchy, up to three levels, to facilitate key rotation? The term ‘KEK’ is commonly used within AS2805 and the IAC Code Set to refer to a key encrypting key used to exchange session keys (including the PIN encryption key, MAC send key etc). With this definition, only the second-lowest layer in the key hierarchy will include KEKs. KEKs may be loaded encrypted under a parent key, thereby adding additional levels to the hierarchy. There is no prescribed limit to the number of levels in the key hierarchy. For Interchange Links, there are several methods detailed in IAC Code Set Volume 4, Section 4.6, for introducing a KEK, namely: • AS 2805.6.6 method; • Native RSA key method; • KTK method; • KEK Component method. Key management must comply with the requirements set out in the IAC Code Set Volume 4, Section 4.5.2. For Interchange Lines, Key Management practices are outlined in the IAC Code Set Volume 4, Section 4.7. A.11. Key management often relies upon manual key handling processes, including key ceremonies and storage of key components. Requirements in A.1.3, A.2.3 and A.3.3 apply to key management processes and require auditors to confirm such processes are being followed. What evidence needs to be shown to an auditor to confirm manual key handling processes are being followed? It is impossible to list all possible scenarios where manual key handling processes are used. A few common examples are shown below - Where keys are loaded into a HSM via components, then the auditor shall observe an actual or demonstration key ceremony. Consistent with test requirement 7-1.c from PCI PIN v3.1. - Where plaintext components rely upon tamper-evident packages, the auditor shall be provided with a sample package to confirm the tamper-evident and anti-observation protections. - Where keys are manually exchanged between organizations, then the auditor shall be shown completed logs, consistent with PCI PIN 7.2.c A.12. Clause 3.1 from Code Set Vol 1 requires IA participants to ensure devices used in Interchange are approved for use within the IAC. How is the approval status of a specific device determined? A device is approved for use within the IAC if it meets one of the following conditions and is not listed on the Revoked Devices List on the AusPayNet website: 1. Listed by an Approved Standard Entity as an approved device under an Accepted Standard (e.g. PCI PTS, PCI MPoC, NIST CMVP). 2. Listed by an Approved Standard Entity as an expired device under an Accepted Standard, has not passed its Sunset Date and was purchased prior to the Expiry Date. 3. Listed on the AusPayNet Approved Devices List on the AusPayNet website. 4. Listed on the AusPayNet Expired Devices List on the AusPayNet website, has not passed its Sunset Date and was purchased prior to the Expiry Date. 5. Pilot approved device with a letter of pilot approval issued by AusPayNet to the acquirer. Conditions included as part of a device approval may be listed on the website and must be validated. A.13. Can devices purchased during the Sunset Period be deployed and used in the IAC? No, only devices purchased during the Approval Period can be deployed and used in the Sunset Period. A.14. Why is a device previously registered and listed on the AusPayNet Approved Devices Page no longer visible? Under the new Device Approval Process effective January 2025 all approval listings which are duplicates of an Approved Standards Entity listing have been removed from the AusPayNet Approved Devices List. Refer to the list managed by the Approved Standards Entity. A.15. HSMs approved under PCI PTS HSM may include a global setting (commonly called PCI mode) where all HSM functionality complies with PCI requirements. Does compliance with the IAC Code Set require the HSM to operate in PCI mode? No, the Code Set requires only that cryptographic operations used for IAC payments comply with the Code Set. The use of PCI mode is encouraged, however is not required for compliance of AusPayNet requirements. If PCI mode is disabled, other HSM security options, including the option(s) enforcing minimum key length(s), shall be appropriately configured in compliance with all applicable requirements of the IAC Code Set. A.16. Listings for PCI approved HSMs include the hardware, firmware and application (if applicable) version identifiers for the approved product. Must the hardware, firmware and application (if applicable)

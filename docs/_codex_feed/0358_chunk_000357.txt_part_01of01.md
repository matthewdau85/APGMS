for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals 18 3. SUPPLEMENTARY ACCESSSIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS ➜ User Support Some of the groups and people with a disability who were consulted during the creation of the Guidelines have a preference for access to information about payment devices and how to use them, including practicing or familiarising themselves with the features (including, for example, through an app). Providing user information or training, should not, however, replace the accessible design of any touchscreen terminals. Allowing people to opt-in to information, for example by providing it on the financial institution’s website, should take into account the following: • All guides, advice and training information should be drafted in plain English, free of technical or legal descriptions – the Australian Inclusive Publishing Initiative (AIPI) provides some useful guidance. • Documentation should be provided in alternative formats, for example, not just as a PDF, but also as an accessibly-designed Word document, including consideration of font size, colour etc. as outlined by the Australian Government’s Accessibility & Inclusivity Digital Guide. • Where videos are used, captioning and transcripts should be provided to allow people with different impairments to access the content. • Web site content should meet WCAG requirements around accessibility. A variety of ideas were discussed during the community consultation period regarding the use of alternative identification or personalisation methods. These will continue to be explored by the payments community as technologies become available and relevant for use when making and verifying payments. Going out in the world is challenging enough without the added problems of simply purchasing food, clothing, entertainment, banking etc.” Keeping payments as accessible as possible is paramount to inclusion of all.” I deserve equal accessibility in life in-general as much as anyone else.” Source: AusPayNet Disability Community Survey August 2019. The challenges of living with disability: “ “ “ Supporting material and background information 4 Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals 20 Understanding Disability ➜ Disability, impairments and barriers There are over 4 million Australians living with disability - that’s 20% of the population, excluding their social supporters or carers. The likelihood of living with disability increases with age. Two in five people aged 65 years or older are living with disability. Disability is also ‘intersectional’, meaning that people may live with one or more impairments, for example, having both vision impairment and also hearing loss, which may increase in severity over time. People with disability are also more likely to experience financial abuse, and within the context of protecting vulnerable customers, this should be reflected in the design of banking products and services. Disability is also intersectional with other dimensions of diversity. For example, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are 1.8 times more likely to live with disability than other Australians. 4. Supporting material and background information The types of disabilities (impairments and medical conditions covered by the Disability Discrimination Act) that AusPayNet Disability Community Survey August 2019 respondents identified as living with (multiple selections were allowed to capture intersectionality of disability): 87% Sensory disability – affects a person’s ability to hear or see. 11% Neurological – affects the person’s brain and central nervous system. 21% Physical disability - affects a person’s mobility or dexterity. 8% Immunological - including the presence of organisms causing, or capable of causing, disease or illness e.g. diabetes. 14% Mental Illness - affects a person’s thinking processes e.g. depression or anxiety. 5% Intellectual or learning disability - affects a person’s abilities to learn e.g. dyslexia. Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals 21 4. SUPPORTING MATERIAL AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION What is disability? The definition of disability, according to the Disability Discrimination Act, is as follows: (a) total or partial loss of the person’s bodily or mental functions; or (b) total or partial loss of a part of the body; or (c) the presence in the body of organisms causing disease or illness; or (d) the presence in the body of organisms capable of causing disease or illness; or (e) the malfunction, malformation or disfigurement of a part of the person’s body; or (f) a disorder or malfunction that results in the person learning differently from a person without the disorder or malfunction; or (g) a disorder, illness or disease that affects a person’s thought processes, perception of reality, emotions or judgment or that results in disturbed behaviour; and includes a disability that: (h) presently exists; or (i) previously existed but no longer exists; or (j) may exist in the future (including because of a genetic predisposition to that disability); or (k) is imputed to a person. To avoid doubt, a disability that is otherwise covered by this definition includes behaviour that is a symptom or manifestation of the disability. According to the Australian Network on Disability, “disability is any condition that restricts a person’s mental, sensory or mobility functions. It may be caused by accident, trauma, genetics or disease. A disability may be temporary or permanent, total or partial, lifelong or acquired, visible or invisible”. What creates barriers for people with disability? An alternate perspective on viewing the way people with disability interact with the world, is through the social model of disability. Moving away from a focus on medical definitions, the social model views disability “as the result of the interaction between people living with impairments and an environment filled with physical, attitudinal, communication and social barriers”.

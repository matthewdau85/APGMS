1 IoT Security in Payment Environments As IoT devices continue to become more widespread, their use and deployment is increasingly crossing over into areas of account-based payments. This may be incidental, with IoT devices deployed within a business environment where payments are also being processed, or more directly with an IoT device being used to accept, perform, or authorize payments on behalf of a user. In all cases, when considering a deployment of IoT devices, the security of the IoT devices and the payment data needs to be considered throughout the device lifecycle. For example, some questions organizations should ask include: • Are the devices designed with security in mind? • Are the devices deployed securely? • Are the devices able to be maintained securely until decommissioned? • Is there a decommission plan for the devices? This bulletin outlines what should be considered when deploying IoT systems into an existing environment which may already contain cardholder data processing systems, from initial planning of the deployment through to the eventual decommissioning of the devices. Stages of an IoT Deployment Lifecycle A Baseline Approach to IoT Security Design The first step is to seek a common understanding and definition of what an IoT device is. The Consumer Technology Association (CTA) in conjunction with the Council to Secure the Digital Economy (CSDE), have produced the C2 Consensus on IoT Device Security Baseline Capabilitiesi (C2 Consensus)1, which defines ‘IoT’ as: Internet of Things. An IoT system involves a physical device that connects to a switched or wireless network, for the purposes of access and control. IoT systems may be connected to open networks, such as the Internet, or closed private networks. An IoT device may have supplementary functions provided through remote execution such as an application running on a phone, tablet, local or ‘cloud’ based computing system. With this broad definition, an IoT device could be a ‘smart’ toaster, desk phone, HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system, network camera, or one of many other types of devices. 1 The C2 Consensus also maps to important guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in their publication, NIST Interagency Report 8259A, IoT Device Cybersecurity Capability Core Baseline. 2 Documents such as the C2 Consensus provides a set of baseline capabilities that IoT devices should meet, as listed below: IoT Device Security Capabilities (from the C2 Consensus) • Device Identifiers – provision of unique values to allow for unique device identification. • Secured Access – protection of device operational and management capabilities through user authentication. • Data In Transit Is Protected – Protection of the confidentiality and integrity of data using cryptography. • Data At Rest Is Protected – Protection of confidentiality and integrity of selected stored data using cryptography. • Industry Accepted Protocols are Used for Communications – Use of secure, widely used protocols, excluding deprecated versions, for communications to and from the device. • Data Validation – Parsing and limiting input data to prevent it from being used directly as code, commands, or other execution flow inputs. • Event Logging – A limited persistent record in the device of relevant events, secured and available to users. • Cryptography – Where cryptography is used, use open, published, proven, and peer-reviewed cryptographic methods with appropriate parameters, algorithms, and option selections. • Patchability – The ability to verifiably update a device’s software and firmware, post-market, with patches that are authenticated. • Reprovisioning – The ability for authorized users to securely reconfigure and redeploy a device post market, especially to return to factory defaults and securely remove data. These baseline controls are mapped onto specific detailed requirements in the document ANSI/CTA 2088-A (Baseline Cybersecurity Standard for Devices and Systems),2 which has been developed through the CTA with a broad range of industry stakeholders. A similar standard for this purpose is ETSI EN 303 645 (Cybersecurity Standard for Consumer IoT Devices)3. For industrial control devices – a very large category that overlaps consumer technology in some areas – a popular standard is IEC 624434. It is recommended that all IoT devices being purchased for deployment into corporate networks, or for use in accepting payments, consider these standards and control sets. Mapping IoT Security Controls to PCI DSS Although not designed specifically for payments, the C2 Consensus baseline, as with many other security standards and control sets, can be mapped to the PCI DSS requirements as shown below. Where gaps exist, they are primarily due to the difference in the target of the controls; device specific design centric (in the C2 Consensus) vs deployment environment aspects of the PCI DSS. 2 https://shop.cta.tech/collections/standards/products/https-cdn-cta-tech-cta-media-media-shop-standards-2020- ansi-cta-2088-a-final-pdf 3 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/303600_303699/303645/02.01.00_30/en_303645v020100v.pdf 4 https://www.iec.ch/blog/understanding-iec-62443 3 This mapping is not intended to imply that a device deployed in a PCI DSS compliant environment meets the C2 Consensus Controls, or that a device meeting the C2 Consensus Controls automatically meets those mapped aspects of PCI DSS. Instead, it shows how requirements for IoT device security capabilities – like those found in the C2 Consensus – can be considered along with the requirements of standards such as PCI DSS to help inform and secure a deployment of IoT devices across the lifecycle of those products.

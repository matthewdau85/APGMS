holders. The Machine Credential Administrator and the organisation are jointly and severally responsible for the storage and use of the Business Machine Certificate including all transactions and communications carried out under or using it. Failure to uphold these responsibilities will result in the cancellation of the credential. Cyber security and end user authentication requirements of the Operational Security Framework The ATO Operational Security Framework (OSF) sets out the minimum level of cyber security requirements a DSP needs to meet to access ATO digital services. The OSF includes a range of requirements which may include multi-factor authentication (MFA). Taxpayer declaration requirements of the Common Business Implementation Guide and service specific implementation guides Before lodging a form, a user (business representative or authorised intermediary) must provide an appropriate declaration as outlined in the Payroll event Business Implementation Guide and the ATO Common Business Implementation and Taxpayer Declaration Guide. Lodgments from a registered agent user must include the Registered Agent Number (RAN) as outlined in the ATO ebMS3 Implementation Guide (DOCX, 1.3MB) . Client on-boarding New and existing subscribers to an online software product will be required to notify the ATO they are using a software providers’ services and present a unique software ID. If your clients have a myID and are authorised for their business in the Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM), they can log in to Access Manager to complete their notification. The ATO provides a link to instructions on completing a notification and high-level messages at My hosted SBR software services . This page is the main source of information for software provider clients. Alternatively, you can instruct them to phone us on 1300 8522 32 and state they would like to 'Notify the ATO of a hosted SBR software service'. Normal proof of record ownership will apply when they phone us. To further assist software providers to support their clients, the ATO provides responses to frequently asked questions at Cloud software authentication and authorisation – Frequently asked questions . Transmission Passing of the software ID for SBR1 (SBR CORE) The software ID is passed in the message through an incorporated element called 'softwareSubscriptionId' in the namespace ' http://sbr.gov.au/identifier/softwareSubscriptionId '. This element is located in the web services security extension (wsse)-security header (see the diagram) and can be added into the message after the message generation process is completed (including signing) and it doesn’t break the message integrity or any existing signatures. There will be no impact on the Reference Client and/or DSPs software packages. The SBR Core Services Requester component will be updated to support setting of the 'softwareSubscriptionId'. Passing of the software ID for SBR 2 (ebMS3) The software ID is passed in the soap:Header by using the ebMS3 custom message property called ‘SoftwareSubscriptionId’. For this purpose, the API of the RequestUserMessage class setMessageProperty(String name, String value) of the embeddable client can be used. The method allows adding a new property with the specified value to the generated message. The property is located in the eb namespace ( http://docs.oasis-open.org/ebxml-msg/ebms/v3.0/ns/core/200704/ ). Error messages returned by SBR as part of Authorisation checks The specific error codes and corresponding external error messages have been published in the ATO Authorisation Errors (XLSX, 442KB) hosted on sbr.gov.au. Passing the software ID for the ATO API Gateway The software ID is provided when requesting an access token from the ATO Authorisation Server (grant jwt). The grant jwt must also include the external identifier, Australian Business Number (ABN), of the customer. The access token request will fail where no cloud notification has been created in Access Manager by the software user. Further information regarding using the ATO API Gateway can be found at the ATO API Portal . Registered DSPs can login to Online Services for DSPs to obtain guidance on integrating to the ATO Authorisation Server . Assistance in implementing CAA ATO assistance to support you onboarding to CAA New cloud software developers and existing DSPs implementing cloud services can seek support from the DPO. If you would like help with onboarding to the CAA solution, raise a ticket in Online services for DSPs . The ATO will assist where possible regarding: the onboarding process (e.g. completing the Cloud Software Authentication and Authorisation request and setting up your machine credential) designing your software to requirements testing and certification processes. Communications Software providers are expected to communicate changes to affected businesses and registered agents directly. The ATO provides high-level messages and instructions on completing a notification at My hosted SBR software services . More information

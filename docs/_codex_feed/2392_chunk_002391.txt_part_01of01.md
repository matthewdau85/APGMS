The Australian Government administers the Ashmore and Cartier Islands, the Australian Antarctic Territory, Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Coral Sea Islands, the Heard and McDonald Islands, the Jervis Bay Territory and Norfolk Island. The Australian Government legislates for these Territories and, in some cases applies the laws of a nearby State. The State laws, as applied to a Territory, may be modified, suspended from operating or repealed by Ordinance.

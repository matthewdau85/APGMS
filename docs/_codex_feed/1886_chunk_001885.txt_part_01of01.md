This paper is NPP Australia Limited’s submission in response to the ASX’s consultation paper “CHESS Replacement Scope and Implementation Plan” issued on 28 April 2018. Executive Summary The New Payments Platform ( NPP or Platform ) presents a significant opportunity for the ASX and the securities industry. The Platform’s combination of 24 x 7 faster funds availability and enriched data capability can drive considerable operational and process efficiency improvements. Interoperability of ISO messaging between the ASX and the NPP will help the ASX to realise its aim to deliver improvements and efficiencies to its stakeholders in all areas associated with payments. The Platform has extensive capabilities which can be effectively leveraged by the ASX, in particular: Real-time movement of funds , 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days of the year with no cut-off times Interoperability with ISO 20022 message structure Direct connectivity options for the CHESS replacement system which already meet stringent security and performance standards Extensive data capabilities with the ability to carry additional data end-to-end together with the payment or via a url link to externally hosted documents Real-time line-by-line settlement which reduces systemic risk and optimises liquidity management Simple addressing with the PayID Addressing Service Straight through processing opportunities Flexibility with the ability to introduce new or customised ISO 20022 messages Overlap and interaction with ASX Payment Providers , many of whom are already participating in the NPP An API Framework (currently under development) will further assist interoperability between the two platforms and the ability to initiate payments. The NPP has been designed and built in a way that it can meet the needs of an evolving digital economy. Additional functionality and capability will be developed and delivered over time which will further enhance the utility of the Platform. Capability currently under development includes “request to pay” functionality, as well as the ability to support recurring payments linked to a customer consent authorising those payments. As well as providing the ASX with real-time payment facilities, the NPP’s capabilities can drive significant processing and efficiency benefits in the following key areas: Settlement – non-batch DvP bilateral settlement Corporate Actions – electronic acceptance and payment of entitlement offers mFund – sharing investor details, automation of regular payments and switching between funds In addition to helping the ASX to drive efficiency and process improvements in the specific areas associated with the CHESS replacement plan (as highlighted in this paper), the Platform could also be used for other payment related processes to drive greater automation and straight through processing, such as for corporate actions, distributions and broker related processes. Overview of the NPP The NPP was designed to support a 24/7 modern, digital economy. It provides a fast, flexible and data-rich payments system for Australian consumers, businesses and government departments, enabling them to make faster, smarter and simpler payments. The NPP brings enormous potential for future payments innovation through its data capability, open-access design and unique layered architecture that can support multiple and competitive products or services. Recently launched to the public in February 2018, currently there are 65 financial institutions offering real-time payments services to their customers (either connecting directly or indirectly to the Platform). We expect a further 20 financial institutions to be onboarded to the Platform over the next 12 months. The NPP is a truly world-leading platform that has become the reference model for other international real-time payments solutions currently in development. NPP benefits The NPP delivers four key benefits: Speed – payments in real-time Always on – 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year Data enriched – more remittance information with payments Simple addressing (PayID) – use an easy-to-remember identifier The Platform enables the real-time movement of money, account to account, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. NPP payments are settled line-by-line in real-time by the Reserve Bank of Australia, effectively eliminating settlement risk typically associated with deferred net settlement arrangements. Built using the global standard ISO 20022 message schema, the Platform has extensive data rich capabilities. With more than 1400 data fields in the ISO clearing message, additional data can be carried end-to-end together with the payment or via a url link to externally hosted documents. In addition, ISO20022 provides a clear standardisation for how to organise data information and data formats (field lengths, codes and character sets) that can be exchanged between parties. With the ASX moving to adopt ISO 20022 messaging as part of the CHESS replacement project, not only is there interoperability with the NPP, there is also a significant opportunity to further enhance current capabilities and processes, drive greater automation and support straight through processing, for the ASX and the wider community. The NPP’s Addressing Service, PayID, enables payments to be directed to an account using an easy to remember alias (a PayID) which has been linked to an underlying bank account. PayIDs can be easily moved from one bank account to another along with all of the associated payments linked to a PayID, which means there is no need to maintain up-to-date details for a customer’s bank account. Currently four alias types are supported on the platform – phone number, email, ABN and an Organisation Identifier, with the ability to add to these over time with new alias types. The Platform also continues to support payments using BSB and account numbers. Future capabilities Additional functionality and capability will be rolled out

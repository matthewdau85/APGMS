For further information, refer to the A-NZ Information Security Guidance Note . 5. Testing The Peppol service provider is required to complete testing to verify the service offering conforms to Peppol specifications and additional local requirements. There are 3 steps of testing required to be completed sequentially: Unit testing. Peppol acceptance testing. Interoperability testing using Peppol Testbed. Note: Peppol service providers already accredited in another jurisdiction will only be required to complete interoperability testing using Peppol Testbed. Step 1: Unit testing Complete unit testing in an internal environment to verify that the service can send and receive Peppol BIS documents in line with the eDelivery documentation . Obtain Test PKI Certificate Obtain the test certificate via the OpenPeppol Jira Service Desk portal . On the portal main page, select ‘PKI Certificate Request’ and choose ‘test’ at the certificate purpose option. Complete the remaining fields and include any attachments as requested such as company registration details. Once OpenPeppol approves, test certificates will be available for download within 10 days. Certificates not downloaded during this timeframe will expire and a new service desk request will need to be raised to have the certificate reissued. Step 2: Peppol acceptance testing – eDelivery Network compliance (Access Point only) The Peppol acceptance tests are conducted in the Peppol Testbed and formally tests compliance with the Peppol eDelivery Network specifications. This test may be completed by the Peppol service provider without OpenPeppol intervention, with the Test PKI Certificate acting as a log on to enter the central Testbed from which the test may be executed. Acceptance Testing involves: verification of certificates (both the Peppol and TLS certificate) validating of the ability to send/receive business documents to/from the Test Access Point generating acknowledgement of the documents sent. The Peppol acceptance testing guide is here OpenPeppol Test and Onboarding (PDF, 1.6MB) . For further information on the testing environment, refer to the eDelivery test suite environment description (PDF, 334KB) . Once completed, submit the test results via the OpenPeppol Jira Service Desk portal . On the portal main page, select ‘Test and Onboarding’ and complete the remaining fields. OpenPeppol will advise if the test results are accepted. Step 3: Complete Interoperability testing using Peppol Testbed Interoperability testing must be completed to ensure you can send and receive valid PINT A-NZ documents. Interoperability testing is completed using the Australia/New Zealand Test Suites in the Peppol Testbed . The PINT A-NZ test suites in Peppol Testbed cover the current effective PINT A-NZ specifications (Billing and Self-Billing). When a new version of the PINT A-NZ specifications is released (published but not yet effective), the Testbed will be updated to include both current effective and the newly published but not yet effective versions of the PINT A-NZ specifications. For accreditation, the Peppol service provider is required to complete the test suite for the current effective PINT A-NZ Billing specification . A user guide explaining how to complete the test suite is available on the PINT A-NZ Testbed homepage . Upon successful completion of the test suite, a downloadable report is generated by Peppol Testbed confirming the Peppol service provider has successfully completed all test scenarios in the test suite. A copy of this report will need to be provided to us via Online services for DSPs or eInvoicing@ato.gov.au . 6. Receive accreditation All Peppol service providers Once all the steps of the accreditation process are successfully completed, we will confirm the accreditation in Australia. We will also advise of annual review date request details to support: Australian Peppol service providers ONLY We will return a countersigned copy of the Peppol service provider agreement. A production certificate will need to be obtained to begin transacting in the Peppol network. The production certificate is obtained via the OpenPeppol Jira Service Desk portal . Select ‘PKI Certificate Request’, choose ‘production’ at the certificate purpose option and complete remaining fields. Once OpenPeppol approves your certificate, it will be available to download for 10 days. Certificates not downloaded within this timeframe will expire and a new Service Desk request to have the certificate reissued will need to be raised. Mutual accreditation with New Zealand Through the Trans-Tasman single economic market agenda, the Australian and New Zealand governments announced a common approach to eInvoicing. With this common approach, the Australia and New Zealand Peppol Authorities have an aligned accreditation process that supports mutual accreditation of Peppol service providers between the two countries. Once you are accredited in Australia, you can request mutual accreditation with New Zealand by directly contacting the New Zealand Peppol Authority at support@nzpeppol.govt.nz . Accreditation annual review There will be an annual review of the accreditation status to ensure Peppol service providers continue to meet their obligations on an on-going basis. An annual review will include: due diligence checks completed by the Australian Peppol Authority provision of a current enforceable Professional Indemnity Insurance policy of at least A$1 million (or equivalent in other currency) per occurrence adherence to A-NZ eInvoicing security requirements, which includes

Each item in the checklist requires a simple positive (tick) or negative (cross) response. Should a particular item require clarification or the provision of additional information, comments can be included at the foot of each section or in a separate advice provided and annexed to the Yearly Audit Compliance Certificate.

If any additional information or clarification is required the Framework Participant should contact the SWIFT PDS Operations Manager. The Yearly Audit Compliance Certificate (including the checklist) must be completed and signed by a duly authorised officer for and on behalf of the Framework Participant. 383 Last amended effective 26/11/18, version 038 r&p 001.18 384 Inserted effective 1/1/22, version 040 r&p 003.21 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE A: CERTIFICATION CHECKLIST Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 83 The Yearly Audit Compliance Certificate must be completed and returned to the Company by the end of February each year, such certificate to cover the prior calendar year and confirm that all SWIFT upgrades required since the last Yearly Audit Compliance Certificate have been implemented.385 385 Last amended effective 19/11/24, version 045 r&p 002.24 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE A: CERTIFICATION CHECKLIST Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 84 YEARLY AUDIT COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE386 TO: COMPLIANCE MANAGERAUSTRALIAN PAYMENTSNETWORK LIMITED SUITE 2, LEVEL 17, GROSVENOR PLACE, 225 GEORGE STREET, SYDNEY NSW 2000 RE: THE HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM FRAMEWORK (CS4) FROM: NAME OF FRAMEWORK PARTICIPANT (“Member”) PLACE OF INCORPORATION AUSTRALIAN COMPANY NUMBER AUSTRALIAN REGISTERED BODY NUMBER REGISTERED OFFICE ADDRESS NAME OF CONTACT PERSON TELEPHONE NUMBER EMAIL ADDRESS Environment - Primary Computer Site • A primary and secondary HSM is available (Clauses 7.4(a) and 7.4(b)) ().387  • Two SWIFT communication lines, a primary and a secondary line for redundancy purposes, are available (Clause 7.7(a)).  • Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) is available and supplied to the SCI hardware configuration (Clause 7.2(a)).  • The area is fitted with adequate protection against fire, flood and water damage (Clause 7.2(a)).  • The secondary HSM was tested twice during the year (Clause 7.4()c).388  • The secondary SWIFT communication line was tested on a minimum of four times during the year or two times at each site for Active-Active Site and Rotating Site Configurations (Clause 7.7()c).389  386 Last amended effective 1/1/24, version 043 r&p 002.23 387 Amended effective 19/11/24, version 045 r&p 002.24 388 Amended effective 19/11/24, version 045 r&p 002.24 389 Amended effective 19/11/24, version 045 r&p 002.24 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE A: CERTIFICATION CHECKLIST Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 85 Environment - Backup Computer Site • Tier 1 Back-up Framework Participants Only - Backup computer site is geographically separate from the primary site (Clause 7.12(a)).  • Tier 2 Back-up Framework Participants Only - Backup computer site configuration meets requirements (Clause 7.13(a)).  • Tier 1 Back-up Framework Participant Only - At least one SWIFT communication line is available, which is physically different from the two located at the primary site.

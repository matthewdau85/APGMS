An employer guide to payday super and the role of real-time payments Superannuation is evolving and it’s all about speed, efficiency, and better outcomes for retirement. The Government has announced reforms to align employers’ payments of Superannuation Guarantee (SG) contributions with salary and wages. The role of real-time payments Modern payment options are already available to support the transition to payday super. They allow employers to make real-time super contribution payments, minimising delays and errors. Central to this transformation is Australia’s real-time payments infrastructure, the NPP. Launched in 2018, the NPP connects over 100 banks, financial institutions and fintechs, facilitating over $6 billion in payments each day moving quickly and securely between bank accounts using Osko®, PayID® and PayTo®. The NPP has the capacity, reach and resilience to process superannuation payments and a number of organisations are already beginning to process super payments on the NPP. Payday super does not require a bulk or batch payments solution. Businesses can continue to provide a bulk or batch payment file to their financial institution or payment service provider who can process these transactions individually on the NPP. FOR SUPERANNUATION, PAYMENTS VIA THE NPP MEANS: Super contributions can be made 24/7, including on weekends and public holidays. Real-time payment outcome information simplifies tracking and reconcilation. Validation of bank account and payee details helps ensure payments are going to the right place.

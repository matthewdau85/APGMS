of security activities (see Appendix D: ); and ▪ Evolving security goals and practices as other business goals and risks evolve. Organizations that follow these basic principles and best practices are not only illustrating a higher level of due diligence in the protection of cardholder data; they are also helping to ensure the long- term viability of payment cards as a safe and secure means for conducting payment transactions. 21 NetIQ Paper “Sustainable Compliance: How to Align Compliance, Security, and Business Goals” (NetIQ, 2012). Information Supplement • Best Practices for Maintaining PCI DSS Compliance • January 2019 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 34 Appendix A: Sample of Industry-Standard Security Frameworks There are numerous governance frameworks available that can be used to complement PCI DSS controls to enhance the overall effectiveness of an organization’s cardholder data security program. Several examples of these frameworks are outlined below. ▪ Control Objectives for Information Technology (COBIT) is a framework for information technology management and governance from the ISACA. COBIT is structured to allow managers to bridge the gap between control requirements, technical issues, and business risks. COBIT enables clear policy development and good practice for IT control throughout organizations. COBIT emphasizes regulatory compliance, helps organizations to increase the value attained from IT, and enables alignment and simplifies implementation of the COBIT framework. ▪ Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) performs research and provides guidance on the topics of enterprise risk management (ERM), internal controls, and fraud deterrence. The COSO Internal Control – Integrated Framework components of internal control⎯Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Control Activities, Information and Communication, and Monitoring Activities⎯are supported by 17 internal control principles that can assist organizations in developing and improving internal governance structures with risk-assessment processes fundamental to maintaining PCI Compliance. ▪ General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the European Union (EU) data protection and privacy regulation that went into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is applicable to any entity that processes personal data of individuals residing in the EU, regardless of where the entity is located, and includes the following rights for data subjects: breach notification, right to access, right to be forgotten, data portability, and privacy by design. Data impacting PCI DSS compliance also affects the adherence to GDPR. ▪ HITRUST® develops, maintains and provides broad access to programs that safeguard sensitive information and manage information risk for organizations across all industries and throughout the third-party supply chain. HITRUST® CSF v9.1 rationalizes relevant regulations and standards into a single overarching security framework. ▪ International Organization of Standardization (ISO) has published numerous standards and guidance for addressing information security issues. The most relevant documents to information security and risk management are the ISO/IEC 27000-series of standards. ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Information technology – Information security management systems – Requirements defines the requirements for creating an information security management system (ISMS) that brings information security, for both IT based and non-IT based security assets, under explicit management control. The standard also has an Annex A, which is a list of Information Supplement • Best Practices for Maintaining PCI DSS Compliance • January 2019 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 35 what is considered best-practice information security controls needed to address information security risks. ▪ Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a globally recognized collection of best practices for information technology service management. Hallmarks of ITIL are an organization-wide approach that involves a development cycle of services from preliminary concept to a full release and continuous improvement. The enterprise-wide approach involved in ITIL can help support ongoing PCI DSS compliance activities across the whole organization. ITIL also stresses the continuous monitoring of key business processes as well as formal change-management processes to minimize business interruptions (incidents), and makes security assessments part of everyday business. ▪ The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) develops standards, metrics, tests, and validation programs to promote, measure, and validate the security in information systems and services. Guidance on the selection and implementation of information security controls is covered in NIST Special Publication 800-53 (Revision 5), Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. In addition, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides a prioritized, flexible, and cost-effective framework for reducing cyber risks.

Not all organizations will have these roles defined. The intent of this appendix is to aid organizations in understanding functional roles typically defined within organizations and what assessment responsibilities those roles may have during PCI DSS assessments. Role Role Definition Access Control Administrators Personnel with responsibility for administering access control to systems, including all end-user access to systems, and administrator or privileged- user access to systems and network devices. Change Administrators Personnel responsible for IT change processes. These users will confirm that authorized personnel approve all change requests. Compliance/Risk Management Groups Personnel responsible for risk oversight and risk assessment across the business. Data Owners Personnel with designated data-ownership

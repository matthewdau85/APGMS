available to a person with sight ➜ The virtual keypad In the absence of a consistent standard for virtual keypads, combined with the variation in individual needs of people living with disability, the following considerations may lead to further enhancements in overall accessibility: • Customers may access the keypad in a variety of ways – some people may not have clear vision or any useable vision, some may have limited, or no use of hands or fingers, including circulation or dexterity impairments. Some people may also be living with additional or other disabilities such as having full or partial hearing loss, or other impairments. • The design of the keypad (including button size, layout, colour, font used), is best developed and tested in consultation with people who live with vision and / or motor impairments. • Interactions with the touchscreen should be simple and not place any excessive burdens on any type of user. • Users should be provided with feedback around what has been entered on the keypad or where the process is up to, for example, by using beeps or voice over to provide a status update. • It may also be useful to consider the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C)’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), specifically those relating to the accessibility of keyboard design and display of content on a screen, as some of the practices may be applicable in other contexts, such as payment device touchscreens. • Where colour coding is provided, it should not solely be relied on to convey meaning as some people may not be able to see colour. 3. Supplementary accessibility considerations 17 3. SUPPLEMENTARY ACCESSSIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals ➜ Haptic feedback Feedback received from the disability community identified varying requirements in the application of haptics and how they are controlled. Preferences are generally dictated by an individual’s unique circumstances and how their impairments may impact their ability to interact with a touchscreen. For example, people with diabetic neuropathy may have reduced sensitivity in their fingertips and require higher levels of haptic feedback. It is therefore recommended as useful to: • Provide some level of control over the haptics, such as the strength of the vibration in how the touchscreen responds to user input. This may, for example, be controlled via the accessibility mode of the device. • Ensure that haptics don’t confuse the user in terms of how they are used to indicate the response from the payment terminal. • Develop and test the solution in consultation with people who live with vision and / or motor impairments. ➜ Use of Gestures The community consultation revealed that not all people with vision and / or motor impairments use touchscreens in a similar way (for example when using a mobile phone or tablet. It should also be noted that some gestures that are available in a general application sense are proprietary to the underlying operating system (for example, gestures in an Apple device may differ to those on an Android device.) Design considerations around gesture control should include: • Allowing for people with limited use of their hands and fingers to enter their PIN. • Gestures should not be complex or onerous to use. • Having tolerance for variance in pressure of inputs (for example, some people may press much harder or softer than others). • Where possible, using familiar or intuitive gestures rather than a bespoke set unique to that particular solution. • The solution being developed and tested in consultation with people who live with vision and / or motor impairments. ➜ Physical design To support the wide range of people who will be using the payment terminals, it’s important to consider accessibility in the physical design of the product. This includes: • The material it is made from (for example, not being slippery to hold for somebody who has limited use of their hands, with grip assistance provided). • Not being too heavy (for example, allowing a wheelchair user picking it up to rest it on their lap), while not being so light as to create difficulties for people with limited sensitivity in their hands. • The ability to hold it with one hand and operate it with the other. • The casing being robust in case it’s dropped. • Its physical placement within the retail environment is also important so that people can use it at different heights, or easily move it to where it can be used (using mobile / wireless connectivity). Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals 18 3. SUPPLEMENTARY ACCESSSIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS ➜ User Support Some of the groups and people with a disability who were consulted during the creation of the Guidelines have a preference for access to information about payment devices and how to use them, including practicing or familiarising themselves with the features (including, for example, through an app). Providing user information or training, should not, however, replace the accessible design of any touchscreen terminals. Allowing people to opt-in to information, for example by providing it on the financial institution’s website, should take into account the following: • All guides, advice and training information should be drafted in plain English, free of technical or legal descriptions – the Australian Inclusive Publishing Initiative (AIPI) provides some useful guidance. • Documentation should be provided in alternative formats, for example, not just as a PDF, but also as an

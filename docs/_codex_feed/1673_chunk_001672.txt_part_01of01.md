Decrease of active EFTPOS Terminals in the June quarter are primarily in locations that have been closed due to COVID-19 (such as bars and clubs etc). Inactive Terminals are not included in the statistics provided. 4 Increase in active terminals due to venues/merchants re-opening post lockdown 5 Increase is due to one Member including EFTPOS Terminal data for the first time.

We may also disclose your personal information to our service providers who are based overseas or need to access, store or transfer personal information overseas. Where information is shared with these third parties, we will observe the applicable Australian Privacy Principles. In connection with any specific occasion on which such a disclosure may occur, at or before the time we collect your personal information, due to circumstances which change from time to time it is not practicable for us to specify the countries in which these recipients are likely to be located. Where your personal information is disclosed, we will seek to ensure that the information is held, used or disclosed consistently with the applicable Australian Privacy Principles. Management and protection of personal information We hold and store your personal information securely, including in archives maintained by a third party information storage provider domiciled in Australia, having regard to its nature and source. Arrangements are in place to safeguard the information against unauthorised access, modification, disclosure and interference and from loss and misuse. These security arrangements include a range of physical, electronic and network security controls such as password protection, multi-factor authentication, firewalls, regular security audits and penetration testing. These controls are supported by internal policies and processes, and also training for our team members. We train our staff about the requirements of the Privacy Act and the need for compliance with the Privacy Act. Additionally, we have a designated person within our office, the General Counsel, who oversees our overall compliance with the Privacy Act and this policy. If you would like more information about how we manage your personal information, please contact us (see “Contact details” below). Accessing and correcting your personal information You may request access to your personal information that we are holding. If you require access to your personal information, please contact our General Counsel as described in “Contact details” below. Before giving you access, we may need to establish your identity by sighting some form of identification or asking you some questions. You may ask us to correct your personal information that we are holding if you believe it is incomplete, inaccurate, irrelevant, out of date or misleading. This access is subject to some exceptions allowed by the Privacy Act. For example, we can deny you access where access would: • be unlawful; • pose a serious threat to the life, safety or health of an individual or to public health or safety; • have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of others; • involve disclosure of a commercially sensitive decision making process; • prejudice enforcement activities such as criminal proceedings or negotiations with you; or • reveal certain information relevant to legal dispute resolution proceedings. We may also deny your request for access if it is frivolous or vexatious. We may charge a reasonable fee to fulfil your request. If we refuse to provide you with access to the information, we will provide you with reasons for the denial of your request and inform you of any exceptions relied upon under the Australian Privacy Principles (unless it would be unreasonable to do so). We take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate, complete, and up to date whenever we collect or use it. If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete, irrelevant or out-of-date, please contact us and we will take reasonable steps to either correct this information, or if necessary, discuss alternative action with you.

as the BSB and Amount field, or variable format such as the Domestic and Auxiliary Domestic fields. Image Capture: A process which captures a digital image of a document as it passes through a reader/sorter. This image may be used simply for storage and retrieval or for analysis by intelligent optical character recognition to read the written dollar value of the document. Leading edge: The right hand edge of a cheque when its face is viewed. It is used as the MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 10 AusPayNet September 2017 reference edge by mechanised reading equipment which reads the MICR code line from right to left. Magnetic ink/toner: The ink/toner used to print the E-13B code line. It is formulated by introducing iron oxide particles into the ink or toner materials, allowing the characters printed to be read by magnetic readers designed for this purpose. Matrix reader: A MICR reading technique that divides characters into horizontal and vertical cells. The cells are then applied to a “pattern” recognition system to identify the characters. The magnetic cell detectors are very sensitive to any air gap between the MICR ink and the detecting heads during the reading process. MICR: An acronym for Magnetic Ink Character Recognition. MICR is a recognition technology based on characters printed with magnetic ink or toner and processed by being magnetised and sensed magnetically. MICR characters are printed information on documents so that the codeline information can be captured by magnetic recognition. MICR Clear Band: A horizontal band, 5/8 inch high, on the front and back of the document, measured from the bottom reference edge, that shall be free of any magnetic ink other than that of the E-13B font. MICR Print Band: A rectangular strip (1/4 inch high) centred vertically across the horizontal width of the MICR clear band, in which the MICR characters must be placed. The MICR characters are ideally centred vertically within the 1/4 inch encoding strip. MICR tester: A device which is used to measure the magnetic signal strength of the printed MICR characters. More advanced MICR testers use a waveform reader to recognise and display character waveforms for comparison to theoretical waveforms. Non-Impact Printing: A term used to refer to the print technologies of xerography, electron beam imaging, magnetography, thermal encoding and the like. In these technologies, toner or ink is transferred and fused to the paper. The result is an image that is raised above the surface of the paper (embossed). OCR: An acronym for “Optical Character Recognition”. OCR technology uses optical sensing to achieve machine readability of fonts including the E-13B font. Optical clear band: A 0.300 inch high band which has included within it the MICR print band. This band is located 0.150 inch above the aligning edge. Permanence: The ability of MICR printing to retain its human and machine readability over the normal life cycle of the document which includes human handling and machine processing. Pile height: The thickness of the ink or toner layer forming an image, frequently used with ink/toners that create embossed images (see Embossment). The Pile height is not equal to the embossment height unless the ink lies completely above the surface of the paper. Print Contrast Signal (PCS): The ratio of the print contrast of a particular printed point with respect to the reflectance of a reference or background region. Refer to the Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms. Amended, effective 19/05/08 Printed information: Lines or text printed on a payment document to convey the informational content of the document and not considered to be part of the background. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 11 AusPayNet September 2017 Printing and Layout Gauge (Glardon Gauge): The gauge is an overlay grid printed on clear plastic representing the standard for character spacing and alignment of the MICR line. The plastic is attached precisely at the bottom to a backing, so that a MICR document can be slipped between the plastic and backing. The positioning of the printed MICR line can then be evaluated against the standard. Reader/sorter: An automated MICR document processing machine that performs a number of functions. It magnetises the MICR characters and senses the electrical signals generated by the subsequent passage of the characters under a read head. It decodes the signals, identifies the characters and validates the field structures. It separates valid (acceptable) documents from invalid or unreadable documents and further separates the acceptable documents into groups. It may optionally endorse and capture an image of each document. The specifics of the sorting process are under the control of its operating software. Reject(s): A term used for a rejected document(s). The document may be rejected visually as not meeting AusPayNet criteria, or by not being readable on a reader/sorter. Most commonly this term applies to reader/sorter non-acceptance. Saturation (Magnetic): The condition in which the flux density of the printing can no longer be increased by increasing the applied magnetisation in a plane parallel to the paper. Secondary reference document: Paper documents specially printed in magnetic ink with characters of the E-13B font. These documents are of known relative signal level and are for use in calibration of equipment used to measure relative signal level. Signal strength: The amplitude of the designated peak(s) in the voltage waveform of a MICR character when measured on an appropriate and properly calibrated MICR tester. Skew: The

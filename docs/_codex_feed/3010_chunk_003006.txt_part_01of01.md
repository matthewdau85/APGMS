supplemental information.

As redirects are commonly used by small and medium business organizations with lower-than-average cardholder data volume, it is less likely an attacker would target a merchant with this type of payment method. However, it is still important for merchants using a URL redirect to ensure their websites are secure, as a compromised web server could mean the redirect is changed to a bogus payment site in order to steal cardholder data—e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks wherein the web server collects and sends data to malicious individuals. This e-commerce option provides an easier way for merchants to provide security for cardholder data, as most of the cardholder data security is performed by the PSP. As the PSP collects, stores, processes, and transmits cardholder data on behalf of the merchant, it is strongly recommended that a merchant ensure the PSP is validated as a PCI DSS compliant service provider to protect the merchant’s cardholder data and enable an easier PCI DSS compliance route. Merchants using a URL redirect e-commerce implementation may be eligible for PCI SAQ A or SAQ A- EP, providing they meet the eligibility criteria of that SAQ. Merchants should consult with their acquirer (merchant bank) or with the payment brands directly to determine whether they are required to validate their PCI DSS compliance and which reporting method they should use. The PCI SAQ A v3.2 currently includes as few as 22 PCI DSS requirements. 2.1.4 Recommendations Since the redirect e-commerce method is usually easier for merchants to secure and results in fewer applicable PCI DSS requirements and lower risk of merchant systems being compromised, this method may be the best option for merchants with limited security or technical ability. However, this option may not suit many merchants wishing to provide advanced features or a more customizable customer payment experience. Merchants should consider the benefits and costs of customization versus the increased need for security controls and resulting increase in the security responsibility and number of applicable PCI DSS requirements. 2.2 The iFrame 2.2.1 What is an iFrame? An iFrame (or Inline Frame) is a method of seamlessly embedding a web page within another web page—the iFrame becomes a frame for displaying another web page. The iFrame is unique. iFrame provides “sandboxing” to isolate content of the embedded frame from the parent web page, thus ensuring that information is not accessible or cannot be manipulated through various exploits by malicious individuals. In e-commerce payments, the pages delivered during the checkout process would be supplied by the merchant's website, with an embedded iFrame supplied by the PSP within that process. The PSP’s iFrame receives all cardholder data entered by the customer.

The customer’s browser requests the payment form from the PSP. 2. The PSP creates a payment form and sends to the customer’s browser within the iFrame. 3. The customer’s browser displays the payment form within the iFrame located on the merchant page. 4. The customer enters their payment details into the iFrame containing the PSP’s payment form. 5. The PSP receives the account data and sends it to the payment system for authorization.

The full list of eligibility requirements for use of this reduced self-assessment questionnaire is outlined within the SAQ A document. However, despite the fact that merchants using iFrame implementations may be eligible for SAQ A, these types of e-commerce solutions are susceptible to compromise by a determined attacker, and merchants should ensure that they are appropriately addressing this risk. To that extent, SAQ A 3.2 was updated with additional requirements including changing default passwords (Requirement 2) and implementing some basic authentication requirements, such as requiring a unique user ID and strong password (Requirement 8). These requirements are intended to help protect merchant websites from compromise and maintain the integrity of the redirection mechanism. Additional information can be found in the PCI SSC FAQ knowledgebase found on the PCI SSC website document library. iFrames provide a degree of security by relying on a technique known as the same-origin policy, which is enforced by all modern web browsers. The assessor will need to verify the merchant is getting the protection expected. This prevents malicious scripts on the merchant’s website from interacting with the contents of the third-party content (i.e., the payment form) in the frame. This

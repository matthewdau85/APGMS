the requested amount is shown in Figure G.9.5A below. In this case the ATM subsequently requests the Cardholder to tap, then using the highest priority application on the Card, the ATM initiates a full EMV withdrawal Transaction by requesting an ARQC with the Transaction amount (tag 9F02) equal to the requested cash amount and the Transaction type (tag 9C) equal to cash withdrawal (01). On successful completion of the contactless exchange the ATM completes its existing processes for Card validation and online PIN entry and sending a financial transaction request message (0200). No further interaction with the Card is required. The ATM returns to the idle state once the process is complete. The preferred Transaction flow where the ATM is opened by presenting the contactless Card (tapping) is shown in Figure G.9.5B below. The ATM moves from the idle state when the Card or device enters the reader’s field. The ATM should select the highest priority application and initiate a default amount value Transaction by requesting an ARQC with the Transaction amount (tag 9F02) set to the ATMs configured default amount else zero and the Transaction type (tag 9C) set to 93 to indicate a contactless Transaction.

EMV@ATM TERMINAL STANDARDS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 126 (b) Chained Transaction support Chained Transaction support for contactless Transactions, as illustrated in Figure G.9.5C and Figure G.9.5D requires that the Cardholder’s identity is reconfirmed before initiating any subsequent Transactions. This may be accomplished by requiring that the Cardholder re-tap the Card or preferably, by re-entering their PIN. The purpose of this second confirmation is to prevent opportunistic fraud which happens when a second user is standing behind a Cardholder who is using contactless requests another service such as withdrawal, when the first Cardholder has left the ATM but the ATM has not returned to an idle state. In the preferred flow opportunistic fraud is further avoided by not permitting chained Transactions subsequent to a withdrawal. (c) PIN re-entry If PIN re-entry is required, either through an incorrect PIN or for Cardholder re-confirmation the Cardholder should not be requested to re-tap the card. The original Transaction information should be re-used for subsequent PIN validation attempts. (d) Cryptographic Data If chained Transactions are to be supported for contactless Transactions, the ATM must be able to reuse the same contactless Card generated cryptographic data for multiple consecutive Transaction requests.

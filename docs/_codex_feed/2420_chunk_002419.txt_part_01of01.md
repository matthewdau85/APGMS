will turn green and a notification will appear on screen: Clicking on a green Alert icon will take you to your My Account page, where you can manage the alert relating to that title. Any Alerts you create will appear on the right-hand side of your My Account page, below Saved searches. Creating a new alert on the My Account page In your My Account , in the Alert management section, click on the Create new button to open the available options for alert queries: Step 1 : You will be prompted to give the alert a name in the Alert name field: Step 2 : In the Find and subscribe section, start building your alert query using the options below. Search for, Search in and Search using options You can use the Search for option to find matches to a particular search term, for example, “green parrot”. You can then use the Search in option to choose where you want to look for that term. Select Name to limit this to titles of legislation only or Name and text to find the search term in both titles of legislation and contents of documents on the Register. You can set how close a match is required by choosing options from the Search using drop-down: Contains phrase - this will find the text or phrase as shown exactly in the Search for field, for example “green parrot” but not “parrot green” or “green crested parrot”; At least one of the words - this will find any of the words in your phrase and will return a result even if all of the words in your phrase are not found, for example, any references to “green” or “parrot” even if both words do not appear in the document; Contains all the words - this will find all of the words but the words don’t need to be in the same order as they appear in the Search for field, for example, where both “green” and “parrot” appear but not necessarily together as a phrase, such as a document relating to the Australian green tree frog and the Australian king parrot. If you do not want to search for any text in particular, leave the Search for field blank, and you can instead set up an alert using the Filters . What filter options are there? There are many additional filters that you can select to refine the alerts that you will receive. You should consider carefully how these filters will work together to ensure that you get the result you want. Filter by Type Click on the Type filter to expand the available options. Using this filter, you can select whether to receive alerts for just principal or amending legislation and for as made (new) legislation or compilations (versions of the law with amendments incorporated). For example, if you are only interested in getting alerts when a Bill has been given Royal Assent and registered as a new Act, you should select the As Made checkbox (and also Act under the Collections filter). If you are not interested in amending legislation, you should check the Principal checkbox. Filter by When this event occurs Click on the When this event occurs filter to expand the available options. You can select to be alerted when an event in the drop-down list occurs for a title that matches your alert criteria. If you do not apply any of the event filters, you will receive results for all events. If you select only some events, you will only receive alerts for those events. For example, if you have set up an alert for the term “green parrot” in Name and text as a phrase, and then select the Amended event checkbox (as above), you will receive notification if any results from a search of “green parrot” are amended. You may also choose to set up an alert with nothing in the Search for field, and just select an event. For example, if you would like to be alerted anytime there is a repeal of a title, you would select the Repealed event checkbox and not select any other options. Filter by Collections Click on the Collections filter to expand the available options. Select one or more options. If you would only like results for a particular type of content, for example legislative instruments, then select the Legislative instrument checkbox (as below), which will limit results to the Legislative instruments collection. Filter by For these titles Click on the For these titles filter to expand the available options. If you would like an alert for a particular title/s and anything authorised by those titles, you can search for the titles in the text field. Start typing part of the title and then select from the list of available titles. As you type, titles will populate below. Once selected, the title will appear as follows: If you would also like to also get alerts for any titles that are authorised by the title you have selected, click the checkbox under the title. Click on the Delete icon next to a title to remove it from the alert query. Filter by Portfolio Click on the Portfolio filter to expand the available options. If you would like to limit your results to a particular portfolio, then select that portfolio from the drop-down menu. For example, if you would only like alerts for

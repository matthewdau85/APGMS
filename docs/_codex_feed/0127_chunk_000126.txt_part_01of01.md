are often low value, intelligence from AusPayNet’s Economic Crime Forum (ECF) reveals that criminals will use stolen data to socially engineer consumers to fall victim to higher value scams, such as bank impersonation scams or other investment scams. The National Anti-Scam Centre and proposed industry scam codes are important in enhancing cross-sectorial collaboration and data sharing. By working with the telecommunications industry and digital communications platforms, we can disrupt phishing attacks and online buying and selling scams. The criminal justice system also has a key role in disrupting and preventing the organised crime syndicates perpetrating these crimes, and will need to be appropriately resourced and supported by strong public-private relationships to respond to what is largely a transnational criminal threat. Card fraud in other categories Fraudulent applications are applications for card accounts made by criminals using either a fictitious identity or another person’s identity, or using false information during the application process. In FY23, fraudulent applications fell 13 per cent. In the wake of recent data breaches, the industry has been increasing the sophistication of its customer verification processes, including ongoing enhanced customer due diligence, and biometric verification for new accounts. Lost and stolen card fraud increased by 53 per cent to $48 million, returning to pre-pandemic levels. However, the most substantial increase in this category was in fraud that occurred outside of the country, with a 136 per cent increase in fraud involving Australian cards lost or stolen overseas. This increase is likely attributable to Australians returning to international travel, following the reopening of borders. Counterfeit/skimming fraud increased by 73.3 per cent to $8.3 million, but this is well below the $18.6 million pre-pandemic figure. The actual number of counterfeit/skimming transactions decreased 58 per cent, meaning that the loss per transaction rose from $88/transaction to $362/transaction. The increase in counterfeit/skimming is also likely attributable to the reopening of international borders, which enabled the return of overseas travel and the re-entry of transnational organised criminals engaging in card skimming. Law enforcement has successfully disrupted several international crime syndicates returning to Australia. This has involved international cooperation, demonstrating the importance of such cooperation in the prevention of economic crime. Fraud involving cards never received increased by 22.4 per cent to $1.7 million, but this figure remains well below pre-pandemic levels of fraud of this kind. Other card fraud increased by 61 per cent to $10.7 million. This is a generic category of fraud, which includes account takeovers. Account takeover – also known as identity takeover – describes where malicious actors use stolen card details or credentials to access an account. They can then remotely provision a virtual card onto their mobile device of choice and use it for device-present payments. UK Finance observed a 124 per cent increase in account takeover fraud throughout 2022, suggesting this type of fraud may be the primary cause of the increase in ‘other card fraud’.

STANDARD INTERCHANGE SPECIFICATION Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 81 (a) The table above lists the minimum required data elements for field 55 by message type. Additional TAGs may be included and must be passed through interchange if valid. Notes: 1. A reversal must contain the data from the original Transaction. 2. Field 55 is not required for Deposit and Refund Transactions. 3. The Authorisation Response Code is the actual response code used by the Issuer in generating the ARPC cryptogram. Where both TAG 8A and Bit 39 are present, TAG 8A must have precedence and must be passed to the Card unaltered, otherwise a rejection may occur when the ARPC cryptogram is presented to the Card. In the absence of TAG 8A, Bit 39 may be mapped and provided to the Card as TAG 8A. In 0220 messages TAG 8A is a Terminal generated value and must be provided to the Issuer. 4. Issuer application data. Present if provided by ICC in Generate AC command response. 5. Required if on-line Issuer authentication performed. EMV (Field 55) ATM Interchanges ICC system related data (DE.55) is a special form, composite data element using ISO 7816-6 TLV coding structures.64 (a) Field 55 must be formed in accordance with clause 4.4.26 of AS2805.2— 2007Amdt 2-2008, as a series of individual data objects, Tag, Length, Value (TLV) encoded as per ISO 7816-6. The order of the data objects is not important.65 (b) Table A.13.14 identifies the minimum EMV data elements that must be included in DE.55. Other valid EMV data elements may be included by the Acquirer. Issuers should have the ability to ignore malformed or unwanted data elements without impairing Transaction processing. Note that DE.55 is not present in response messages for contactless transactions.66 Message Type Data Element EMV Tag LEN 0200 0210 022x6 0230 042x 0430 Comment Transaction currency code 5F2A 2 P - P - P - Present if provided Issuer Script Template 1 71 ..127 - C2,3 - - - - Issuer Script Template 2 72 ..127 - C2,3 - - - - 64 Amended effective 1/1/16, version 002 r&p 002.15 65 Amended effective 1/1/16, version 002 r&p 002.15 66 Amended effective 1/1/16, version 002 r&p 002.15 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 6 – ATM SYSTEM CODE ANNEXURE A.

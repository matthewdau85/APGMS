Accessible Information that is readily available and easily obtained by the end user. ACSC Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) leads the Australian Government’s efforts to improve cyber security. Their role is to help make Australia the most secure place to connect online. The ACSC produces the Australian Government Information Security Manual (ISM). Add-on marketplace API interfaces that are offered by a DSP, for use by other third-party software developers to provide additional value add services to end customers. API (Application programming interface) An API is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software. Is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. ASVS 3.0 (Application Security Verification Standard) A framework of security requirements and controls that focus on normalising the functional and non-functional security controls required when designing, developing, and testing modern web applications. Audit log The process of documenting activity within the software systems used across an organization. Audit logs record the occurrence of an event, the time at which it occurred, the responsible user or service, and other items. Authentication (Multi-Factor Authentication) Authentication is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it says it is. Authentication technology provides access control for systems by checking to see if a user's credentials match the credentials in a database of authorized users or in a data authentication server. ATO considers Authentication access controls as a minimum for Client Controlled software. Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) is a method to authenticate an individual using 2 or more authentication factors to verify their identity, when they log into software. ATO considers MFA as a minimum for DSP controlled Cloud based software. ATO Australian Taxation Office ATO wholesale services Are services that are provided through the SBR Channel, the ATO API Portal, or other ATO channels. Biometrics Allows a person to be identified and authenticated based on recognizable and verifiable data through unique biological characteristics. Brute Force Lockout A brute-force attack is an attempt to discover a password by systematically trying every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until you discover the one correct combination that works. A brute force lockout event occurs after a specified number of incorrect attempts. ATO standard is 5 incorrect attempts. Certification - Self & Independent Independent certification seeks to provide the ATO with a level of assurance a DSP has robust security practices in place across the organisation. (iRAP or ISO/IEC 27001 standards) Self-assessment requirement seeks to provide ATO with a level of assurance a DSP will have robust security practices in place across the organisation. (iRAP, ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27002, SOC2, OWASP ASVS 3.0 or later, NIST) CISA Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Ciphers The formulas used to encode (encrypt) and decode (decrypt) messages are called encryption algorithms, or ciphers. Ciphertext Encrypted data is called ciphertext. unencrypted data is also known as plaintext. Client Controlled Software that is loaded and stored on a client’s local computer, or server, and transmits to the ATO. Cloud software Software that is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. It is usually managed remotely. Commercial software Software which is produced for the purpose of on selling. CVE CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) provides a method for publicly sharing information on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exposures. Cryptography The science of encrypting and decrypting information. It provides for secure communication in the presence of malicious third parties - known as adversaries. Encryption uses an algorithm and a key to transform an input (i.e. plaintext) into an encrypted output (i.e. ciphertext). Data hosting Is the act of storing the data on a stable and accessible web platform. By default, a DSP should host data onshore. Data at rest Data that is not actively moving from device to device or network to network such as data stored on a hard drive, laptop, or flash drive. Data breach A data breach is an unauthorised access or disclosure of personal information, or loss of personal information. Data breaches may be caused by malicious action, human error, or a failure in information handling systems. Data in transit Data that is actively moving from one location to another: for instance, device to device or network to network. De-whitelisting The process of preventing the ability to transact with ATO production services. DSP (Digital service provider) Are software developers that produce digital systems that perform services through the SBR, including APIs for tax & business accounting, payroll, super and business registration. Direct connecting Software transmits direct to the ATO via ebms3 / AS4 protocol. ebMS3 The ebMS3 AS4 messaging capability is the protocol Digital Service Providers are required to build into their software to directly connect to the ATO through the Standard Business Reporting (SBR) digital channel. Encryption The process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access. Encryption key management Lifecycle management of encryption keys protecting them from theft, loss, or misuse. The aim is to minimise the risks of compromised keys. Encryption at rest Is designed to prevent an attacker from accessing the unencrypted data by ensuring the data is encrypted when on disk. If an attacker obtains a hard drive with encrypted data but not the encryption keys, the attacker must defeat the encryption to read the data. Encryption in transit Is when the encrypted data is active,

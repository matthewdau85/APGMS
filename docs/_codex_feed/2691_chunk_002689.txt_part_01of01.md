SSC Standard. 9 Diagram 3: Typical complex telephone environment and call flow prior to CHD being present. Table 3 – Call flow prior to CHD being present Step 1: The customer makes a call to the entity. Step 2: The call traverses the carrier network, the telephone switch answers and directs the call to an available agent. Step 3: The entity’s voice and data network transmit the call to the agent. Step 4: The agent answers the call and interacts with the customer. Step 5: The agent enters data into the customer database. Step 6: The event is reported. Step 7: The call is recorded, and the recording is stored.

Account data is transmitted and received within the telephone environment, processed by the entity, and stored. The systems within this environment are in scope for the PCI DSS as the systems (now represented in red) have the potential to store, process, or transmit account data. Systems, devices, or networks within other areas of the business (shown in the diagrams as Finance/HR/Other) as well as any third parties connected to the systems handling CHD may also be in scope for PCI DSS. Carriers providing only access to public networks2 are generally considered outside the scope of PCI DSS, hence the carrier network in this example represented in green. Diagram 4: Telephone environment and call flow where CHD is captured and stored 2 Carrier networks may be in scope for other types of services.

Step 2: The spoken account data enters the telephone environment via the telephone switch. Step 3: The account data is transmitted by the entity’s voice and data network to the agent. Step 4: The agent inputs the CHD into their desktop PC via the keyboard. Step 5: Customer data is entered into the customer relationship management system (CRM) / Customer Database where it is stored. (It is assumed that no CHD is stored). Step 5a: The account data is transmitted to the Payment Service Provider (PSP) or acquirer. For example, this may occur via data input into an application on the agent’s desktop, via a virtual terminal accessed hosted by the PSP or acquirer over a secure Internet connection from the agent’s desktop, or via a physical point of interaction (POI) payment terminal. Step 5b: The PSP processes and potentially stores the CHD and returns a payment validation reference to the agent desktop or payment terminal. Step 6: This interaction is recorded on the reporting server. Step 7: The call-recording equipment attached to the network captures the account data, and the account data is stored in the call-recording storage. Call recording ceases, it is indexed and stored. At this point, call data can be queried. 2.3.2.3 Identification of the CDE Diagram 5 focuses on the cardholder data environment shown in Diagram 4, illustrating the potential extent of the CDE within the call center environment (the grayed area with an orange frame).

Consider the following definition of a service provider provided in the PCI SSC Online Glossary3: [A] business entity that is not a payment brand, directly involved in the processing, storage, or transmission of cardholder data on behalf of another entity. This also includes companies that provide services that control or could impact the security of cardholder data. Examples include managed service providers that provide managed firewalls, IDS and other services as well as hosting providers and other entities. If an entity provides a service that involves only the

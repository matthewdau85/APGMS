In 2023, the Australian government released a Strategic Plan for Australia’s payments systems, identifying significant benefits and opportunities for Australia in modernising its payments infrastructure - including uplifting competition, productivity and innovation across the economy. The same year, the payments industry announced plans to decommission Australia’s legacy payments platform, the Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS), identifying 2030 as the target date. Traditionally responsible for account-to-account payments like superannuation, payroll, taxes and direct debits, BECS was not designed to meet the demands of the increasingly digitised global and Australian economy and evolving end user expectations. The planned decommissioning of BECS means all businesses in Australian will need to work with their bank or payment services provider to move their payments off this legacy infrastructure.

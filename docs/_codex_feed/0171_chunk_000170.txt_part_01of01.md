Welcome Welcome to the seventh Cross-Border Payments Round-Up, a biannual newsletter sharing updates on the progress on the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) continues its work on ten action items across three priority themes, underpinned by five further generic actions. Source: FSB Cross-Border Payments Advisory Council (CBPAC) AusPayNet’s CBPAC continues to support and coordinate industry activities that will be key to successfully implementing the roadmap and domestic cross-border payment priorities. The targets remain in place and are in Appendix 1 . General Round-Up The FSB continues with its Work Programme for 2025. While more than half the actions under the Roadmap have been completed, the key performance indicators (KPIs) indicate that significant effort is needed to reach the Roadmap goals for faster, cheaper, more transparent and inclusive cross-border payments. The FSB will reframe its strategy to focus on identifying and addressing the challenges to implementing the Roadmap actions. It will also strengthen engagement with the private sector. The FSB also noted – in their letter to the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting, held in February 2025 in South Africa – that continued leadership by the G20, to encourage national authorities and others to take the necessary steps at the local level, will help to achieve global progress. This is because the initiation and final receipt of cross-border payments typically involves payment systems and frameworks at the domestic level. They further noted that they would take a focus on regional developments, particularly in those jurisdictions, regions and segments most affected by frictions in cross-border payments. In July 2024, the Bank for International Settlements' (BIS) Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), together with the G7 Presidency, organised a conference to expedite the interlinking of fast payment systems (FPS). In their Communique of October 2024, the G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors reiterated their support of and commitment to a timely and effective implementation of the G20 Roadmap to enhance cross-border payments to make them faster, cheaper, more transparent, and more inclusive, while maintaining their safety, resilience, and financial integrity. They further noted that improving cross-border payments should benefit both advanced economies and emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), contribute to financial integration, and reduce the risk of market fragmentation. In December, we were honoured to have Maha El Dimachki, Head of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Singapore Centre, attend our annual Payments Summit as a guest speaker. Maha participated in a fireside chat with our CEO, Andy White, sharing insights into the work being undertaken by her team. You can revisit the Fireside Chat here . Taskforce Progress Payment System Interoperability and Extension (PIE) Taskforce CPMI’s PIE Taskforce has published a webinar on their task teams’ work and planned deliverables in 2025. The last meeting of the CPMI PIE Taskforce was held in January 2025 and was the final meeting to be held with the current Member composition. CPMI is seeking to renew the PIE Taskforce by inviting market stakeholders to join. In December 2024, CPMI, through its PIE taskforce, sought feedback from industry and other external parties on how to best enhance cross-border payments. AusPayNet provided a response to the consultation. CPMI PIE Taskforce’s Industry Task Team 3 published their Consolidated Report: Fostering ISO 20022 Harmonisation in January 2025. This is an insightful stocktake of ISO 20022 global implementation. In addition, it evaluates the necessary updates to align with the CPMI’s harmonised ISO 20022 data requirements, assessing challenges to broad adoption, and developing proposals to address these issues. The BIS, in partnership with CPMI, have published ‘ Brief No 6; Changing the clock: practical approaches to extend payment system operating hours ’. Whilst there is no current appetite in Australia for extending the operating hours of HVCS, this paper outlines the challenges, and considerations should that position change. Legal, Regulatory and Supervisory (LRS) Taskforce The FSB has not published any summary or action points of its LRS Taskforce since April 2024. However, the FSB did publish two papers of relevance in December 2024. The first, ‘ Final report; Recommendations to Promote Alignment and Interoperability Across Data Frameworks Related to Cross-border Payments ’ provides 12 recommendations such as adoption and harmonisation of ISO 20022 and adoption of the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Recommendation 16 (Travel Rule). Recommendation 9 of this paper is of particular interest to Members in that it proposes that “National authorities should provide a clear and reasonable legal pathway for cross-border payments market participants to transmit across borders data related to payment processing, risk management, or fraud and financial crime prevention.” The second paper is the ‘ Final report: Recommendations for Regulating and Supervising Bank and Non-bank Payment Service Providers Offering Cross-border Payment Services ’. It provides six recommendations for authorities to consider with respect to payments service providers operating in cross-border payments within their jurisdictions in order to assess risk and develop appropriate strategies to deliver consumer protections and oversight of licensing, registration and compliance with AML/CTF compliance programs. Similar to the CPMI PIE Taskforce, in December 2024, the FSB invited firms that offer cross-border payment services and relevant industry associations to nominate senior representatives to serve on the FSB’s Taskforce on Legal, Regulatory, and Supervisory matters. AusPayNet was successful in its nomination and looks forward to working with the FSB on its implementation of its policy recommendations, as well as to addressing any other

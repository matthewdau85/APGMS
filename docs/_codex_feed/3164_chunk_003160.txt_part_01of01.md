All Rights Reserved. Use strong passwords and change default ones CHANGE YOUR PASSWORDS REGULARLY. Treat your passwords like a toothbrush. Don’t let anyone else use them and get new ones every three months. TALK TO YOUR SERVICE PROVIDERS. Ask your vendors or service providers about default passwords and how to change them. Then do it! Also, if your service provider manages passwords for your systems, ask them if they’ve changed those vendor default passwords. MAKE THEM HARD TO GUESS. The most common passwords are “password” and “123456.” Hackers try easily-guessed passwords because they’re used by half of all people. A strong password has seven or more characters and a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols (like !@#$&*). A phrase can also be a strong password (and may be easier to remember), like “B1gMac&frieS.” DON’T SHARE. Insist on each employee having their own login IDs and passwords – never share! 65% Ponemon Institute of SMBs that have a password policy do not strictly enforce it Cost Ease Risk Mitigation TYPICAL DEFAULT PASSWORDS THAT MUST BE CHANGED: [none] [name of product/ vendor] 1234 or 4321 access admin anonymous company name database guest manager pass password root sa secret sysadmin user Your passwords are vital for computer and card data security. Just like a lock on your door protects physical property, a password helps protect your business data. Also be aware that computer equipment and software out of the box (including your payment terminal) often come with default (preset) passwords such as “password” or “admin,” which are commonly known by hackers and are a frequent source of small merchant breaches.

All Rights Reserved. Protect card data and only store what you need ASK AN EXPERT. Ask your payment terminal vendor, service provider, or merchant bank where (or if) your systems store data and if you can simplify how you process payments. Also ask how to conduct specific t ansactions (for example, for recurring payments) without storing the card’s security code. OUTSOURCE. The best way to protect against data breaches is not to store card data at all. Consider outsourcing your card processing to a PCI DSS compliant service provider. See Resources on page 26 for lists of compliant service providers. IF YOU DON’T NEED CARD DATA, DON’T STORE IT. Securely destroy/shred card data you don’t need. If you need to keep paper with sensitive card data, mark through the data with a thick, black marker until it is unreadable and secure the paper in a locked drawer or safe that only a few people have access to. LIMIT RISK. Rather than accepting payment details via email, ask customers to provide it via phone, fax, or regular mail. TOKENIZE OR ENCRYPT. Ask your merchant bank if you REALLY need to store that card data. If you do, ask your merchant bank or service provider about encryption or tokenization technologies that make card data useless even if stolen. SEE PAGE 24 Cost Ease Risk Mitigation ENCRYPTION PRIMER Cryptography uses a mathematical formula to render plaintext unreadable to people without special knowledge (called a key). Cryptography is applied to stored data as well as data transmitted over a network. ENCRYPTION changes plaintext into cyphertext. DECRYPTION changes cyphertext back into plaintext. For example: It’s impossible to protect card data if you don’t know where it is. What can you do? Another place to consider whether you are storing payment data is in emails. If you receive card details via email, you can still process the transaction, but delete the email immediately and then let the sender know how you prefer to receive cardholder data (and that email is not the best way to send it). Do not simply reply using the original email from your customer. Instead delete the card details from the reply email, otherwise you are further exposing the card data via storing the original email, the sent email, etc. Tokenization has a similar goal to encryption but works differently. It substitutes card data with meaningless data (a “token”) that has no value to a hacker. Merchants can use tokens to submit subsequent transactions, process a refund, etc. without needing to store the actual payment card details. The token is used by your payment processor to look up the card details, which they store instead of you.

Inspect payment terminals for tampering Be vigilant and follow these steps: KEEP A LIST of all payment terminals and take pictures (front, back, cords, and connections) so you know what they are supposed to look like. LOOK FOR OBVIOUS SIGNS of tampering, such as broken seals over access cover plates or screws, odd/different cabling, or new devices or features you don’t recognize. The Council’s guide

The industry CNP Fraud Mitigation Framework defines an approach to reduce the growing level of online card fraud in Australia. Card-Not-Present (CNP) fraud now represents almost 85% of all card fraud on Australian cards, and costs the e-commerce industry close to half a billion dollars each year. We have been consulting with our Members, merchants, the RBA, gateways and payment service providers to develop a framework to reduce the level of CNP fraud in Australia. In addition to reducing online card fraud, the Framework is also designed to build consumer trust and support continued growth in e-commerce. The Framework was implemented on 1 July 2019, with the first reports covering Q2 2019. A summary of our Framework is provided below The Framework forms Volume 7 of the Issuers and Acquirers Code Set which is available here .

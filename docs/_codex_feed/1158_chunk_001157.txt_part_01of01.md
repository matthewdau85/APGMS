Why use RAM for your business By linking your business in RAM once, you can simplify your interactions with government agencies. This means easier access to services like tax, grant applications and employee super contributions, with less paperwork and improved efficiency. You can also view, change or remove authorisations at any time. This gives you greater control over who has access to your business's sensitive information and allows you to protect your business from unwanted access.

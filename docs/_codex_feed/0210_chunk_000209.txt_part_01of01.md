In January 2024, AusPayNet responded to Treasury’s consultation on introducing a regulatory framework for mandatory industry scam codes. In our submission, we supported the introduction of a whole-of-ecosystem regulatory framework to ensure all key sectors in the scams lifecycle take appropriate steps to prevent, detect, disrupt and respond to scams. We also noted that the distinction between authorised and unauthorised fraud is a key concept in delineating scams from other types of fraudulent activity. Additionally, given the prevalence and impact of scam emails and websites, we strongly encouraged the inclusion of internet service providers (ISPs) and email service providers within the scope of the framework. Some Members suggested that non-bank payment service providers should also be designated, to ensure that customers are protected regardless of the payment method or service provider used, and to allow for better collaboration on disrupting scams across the entire payments ecosystem. AusPayNet’s submission is available below.

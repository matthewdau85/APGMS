Legislative instruments or LIs are laws on matters of detail made by a person or body authorised to do so by the relevant authorising legislation. Examples of LIs include regulations, rules and determinations. Under the Legislation Act 2003 , all legislative instruments must be registered on the Federal Register of Legislation. The Federal Register of Legislation contains authorised versions of every legislative instrument made since 1 January 2005 and every instrument made before then but still in force on 1 January 2008.

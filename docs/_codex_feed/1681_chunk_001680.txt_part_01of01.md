the totality of exposure calculations, considering the types of exposures disclosed and the scalability of risk, and a consideration of the risk rating principles in Table 1 below. Table 1 Risk Rating Principles Risk Ratings Guiding Principles Low 1. Data assets are not exposed to known vulnerabilities. 2. Gaps to relevant standards have minimal security impact 3. Mitigations for system components vulnerabilities are mitigated appropriately. 4. Mitigations are verified by third party testing. Medium 1. Data assets are exposed to some vulnerabilities. 2. Gaps to relevant standards have modest security impact 3. System component vulnerabilities are not adequately mitigated. 4. Data assets are exposed to non-scalable vulnerabilities. 5. System component vulnerabilities are subjected to complex attacks with limited data asset exposure. High 1. System component vulnerabilities are subjected to non-complex attacks. 2. Significant gaps compared to relevant existing standards 3. Data assets are exposed to scalable vulnerabilities. 4. Compromise of data assets will lead to a significant scale of fraud. 4.3.6 Low risk assessment If the Company determines on the outcome of the SRA that the Device is low risk the Company will: accept the Device for approval; send to the Device Approval Applicant a Letter of Approval in accordance with clause 4.4 below; and publish the Approved Device on the AusPayNet-Approved Devices List. 4.3.7 Medium risk assessment If the Company determines on the outcome of the SRA that the Device is medium risk: the Company may accept the device for approval with conditions and will: (i) send to the Device Approval Applicant a Letter of Approval in accordance with clause 4.4 below detailing the applicable conditions; and (ii) publish the Approved Device on the AusPayNet-Approved Devices List; or where the SRA Assessment Report identifies security vulnerabilities, provided the Acquirer is the Device Approval Applicant or the Acquirer agrees in writing to be appointed as Pilot Sponsor, the Company may accept the Device on a pilot basis and will send the Device Approval Applicant and Pilot Sponsor, where appointed, a Pilot Letter of Approval detailing the pilot conditions as described in clauses 4.4(c) and 4.6 below. 4.3.8 High risk assessment If the Company determines, on the SRA Assessment Report, that the Device is high risk, the Company will decline the Application for Approval in accordance with clause 4.4(d) below. 4.3.9 Timing The Company will endeavour to complete the SRA Process within two months from receipt of all the documentation referred to in clause 4.3 above. The actual timing will depend on the time the Device Approval Applicant takes to respond to requests for information from the Company, the complexity of the solution, and the quality of documentation received. 4.3.10 Costs The Device Approval Applicant agrees to pay reasonable external costs associated with the device evaluation. The Company will determine what external costs are required. These costs may include technical security consulting and system testing by a specialised testing company. The Company will provide an estimate of any such costs and the Device Approval Applicant must accept the costs in writing prior to the Company incurring them. If the Device Approval Applicant does not agree with the Company’s determination of the external costs required or the estimate of external costs, the Device Approval Applicant can request a review under Part 5 below. 4.4 Notification of decision and publication The Company will notify the Device Approval Applicant in writing of its decision. If the Company approves a Device, the Company will issue a Letter of Approval to the Device Approval Applicant, in a form to be determined by the Company, but such letter will contain at a minimum: (i) the name of the Device Approval Applicant; (ii) the Approved Device; (iii) the approval date; (iv) the Approval Period which will be five years from the approval date or such other period as set out in the Letter of Approval; and (v) the conditions, if any, associated with the approval; and (vi) publish on the AusPayNet-Approved Devices List, the Approved Device, setting out the minimum details contained in the Letter of Approval. If the Company approves for Pilot a Device, the Company will issue a Pilot Letter of Approval to the Applicant and the Pilot Sponsor where appointed, detailed in clause 4.6 below, but such letter will contain at a minimum: (i) the name of the Device Approval Applicant; (ii) the name of the Acquirer; (iii) the Device identifiers (model name, hardware version, firmware version, application version or other details as appropriate); (iv) the security vulnerabilities identified in the SRA Assessment Report that are required to be mitigated before the technology can be approved for pilot; (v) the Approval Period of the Pilot; and (vi) the conditions of the Pilot including the liability shift to the Acquirer under clause 4.6.3 below in accordance with the Structured Risk Assessment Process. If the Company declines the Application, the Company will advise the reasons for its decision. 4.5 Repeat applications If an application for approval via SRA of a Device is declined, the Company will only accept a repeat application and undertake the SRA Process again if the Device Approval Applicant can demonstrate a documented change in the security landscape or change in the Device justifying, in the Company’s absolute discretion, reconsideration of one or more of the reasons for the Company’s original decision. 4.6 Pilot Letter of Approval, Conditions for Pilot and Outcomes 4.6.1 Pilot Letter The Pilot Letter of Approval will: (i) identify the security vulnerabilities

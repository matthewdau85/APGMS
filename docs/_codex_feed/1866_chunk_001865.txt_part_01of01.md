Momentum is building toward the transition to real-time payments and Australia’s payments future. In 2024, 1.6 billion transactions flowed through the NPP, totalling $1.99 trillion —a 23% increase from 2023 - demonstrating growing adoption of real-time payments. In today’s fast-paced economy, fast, efficient payments are essential. Government, businesses and consumers all benefit from always-available, faster payments that are data-rich to thrive in the digital economy. These capabilities are critical for Australia’s productivity and competitiveness. The NPP was built to meet these needs and evolve for the future, currently processing more than 30% of Australia's account-to-account payments. With AusPayNet setting 2030 as the target to retire Australia’s legacy direct entry payments infrastructure, the Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS), AP+ is working closely with industry to support the movement of the remaining 70% of account-to-account payment volume to the NPP. Since early 2024, AP+ has mobilised an extensive program of work to ensure the NPP has the capability, capacity, reach and resilience to easily handle large volumes of transactions in real time. NPP fast facts Source: AP+ 31 March 2025 and RBA Payments data. In addition to the ongoing capability and product enhancements, AP+ is focused on growing awareness of the NPP and its benefits, along with providing the education and mobilisation needed by users of BECS across government, industry and businesses to support the transition. Bringing the industry together toward Australia’s payments future To provide the necessary oversight and governance for this significant industry initiative, AP+ recently established the Move to NPP Steering Committee, led by independent Chair, Geoff Summerhayes. The Committee will play a key role in guiding the delivery of the Move to NPP program, focusing on readiness and the broader activities required for a smooth and well-managed industry transition. AP+ also welcomes the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) recent risk assessment on the planned decommissioning of BECS. The report underscores AP+’s investment in the NPP and progress made over the last year in delivering the next generation of account-to-account payments.

Webinar: The move to NPP – an update on focus areas The session will cover: Key updates on the AP+ roadmap: move to NPP initiatives A panel discussion on the recommendations from the RBA risk assessment on the proposed decommissioning of BECS Panel guests: Ellis Connolly, Head of Payments Policy, Reserve Bank of Australia Luke Wilson, COO, Australian Payments Network (AusPayNet) Monday 5 May 2025 12.00pm – 12.45pm AP+ roadmap initiatives to support the move to NPP The AP+ roadmap initiatives outlines the key requirements and initiatives to ensure the NPP has the required capability, capacity, reach and resilience to easily handle large volumes of transactions. In this update, we're sharing some key developments, including: Enhancements to NPP processes and payment messaging Upgrading NPP’s ISO 20022 messaging for global alignment Designing a service to more efficiently process large volumes of bulk payments across the platform Ensuring sufficient capacity for future NPP payment growth Connecting all relevant accounts to send and receive NPP payments Establishing a contingency framework for NPP ahead of the BECS decommissioning date AP+ roadmap: move to NPP initiatives 1. Enhancements to NPP processes and payment messaging We’ve been in discussion with industry and a range of stakeholders to identify enhancements to NPP processes and payment messaging that would add value for financial institutions, digital service providers and end users. The proposed enhancements will support a consistent industry wide approach for both payers and payee experiences and further enhance fraud screening. Some of these enhancements have been confirmed for delivery as part of the NPP annual release cycle at the end of 2026. These include: Payday super identifiers: Additional data elements are being introduced to support the processing of superannuation payments in light of proposed Payday super legislation, including payroll / qualifying earnings date and the identification of a payment as a refund. Enhanced PayTo messaging : Ensuring additional information is passed in the payment message to the receiving bank to better support fraud screening, including identifying the ultimate creditor and categorisation of merchants. AP+ continues to consult with industry and stakeholders on further proposed enhancements including: Batch identifiers : Introducing the use of data fields within the NPP payment message to group transactions together, making it easier to identify individual payments originating from a batch file. Process to support bulk returns: Developing a process that supports Participants being able to deal with a large number of returns that relate to one bulk file which will be important in the adoption of the NPP for large bulk files. Developing a standard payment instruction format: At present, an ABA file or some form of alternative proprietary payment instruction format is used by digital service providers and other end users for processing transactions through BECS. These file formats have been designed around the BECS system and are limited to the specific features of a BECS payment. To help with integration and reduce bespoke arrangements, AP+ is working with Participants and the industry to develop a standard payment instruction format for NPP payments to replace these existing file formats. This will help facilitate Participants, payment service providers and the wider ecosystem in building payment offerings to receive or distribute transactions that deliver a standard and consistent experience for both payers and payees. ​ In our discussions with the DSPANZ payments working

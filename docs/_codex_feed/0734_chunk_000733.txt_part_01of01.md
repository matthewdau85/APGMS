Merchant Choice Routing – Online Notification Guidelines AusPayNet February 2025 Version 1.1 Merchant Choice Routing – Online Notification Guidelines P a g e | 2 Context Introduction These Online Notification Guidelines recommend a range of best practices for Acquirers, Gateways and their merchants to implement Merchant Choice Routing Notification to customers in an online environment. The Guidelines focus on three areas: (a) Online text to notify customers of Merchant Choice Routing; (b) Updates to be included in a merchant’s Terms and Conditions to provide customers more detailed information regarding Merchant Choice Routing online and how it may impact the customer’s transaction; (c) Updates to be included in a merchant’s “Frequently Asked Questions” to help address typical customer questions on Merchant Choice Routing online and how it may impact the customer’s transaction. Background In November 2019, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) issued a paper seeking stakeholder views on potential issues in the payments industry including Merchant Choice Routing (MCR) and its uptake in the market. In May 2021 the RBA commenced consultation on draft standards created as a result of feedback received following the release of the 2019 Issues paper. The draft standards encompassed proposed policy changes, including the expectation that industry will follow a set of principles regarding implementation of MCR in the ‘device-not-present1’ (online) environment. In October 2021, the RBA published its Review of Retail Payments Regulation Conclusions Paper, which confirmed that in addition to its expectation that all acquirers and payment facilitators will offer MCR functionality for ‘device-present’ (in-person) transactions and promote the functionality to their merchant customers, it expects all acquirers, payment facilitators and gateways to offer and promote MCR functionality to merchants in the online environment by the end of 2022. 1 The RBA uses the terms ‘device-present’ and ‘device-not-present’, rather than ‘card-present’ and ‘card-not- present’, in recognition of the growing number of card payments customers make by presenting a device other than a physical payment card. Device-present refers to transactions made through a scheme debit network at a point of sale, where the card, mobile phone or other device interacts with an acceptance technology to authenticate the transaction. This includes transactions made using a POS card/device acceptance terminal and also includes any paper-based back up arrangements. The transaction may involve the cardholder entering a PIN (or in some circumstances a signature) and contactless payments. Device-not-present refers to transactions made through a scheme debit network processed via ‘remote’ card acceptance technology where the card, mobile phone or other device is not able to physically interact with the technology to authenticate the transaction. Examples of these kinds of transactions include: card details provided to the merchant on a website; and mail/telephone orders. The same terms are used in these Notification Guidelines. Merchant Choice Routing – Online Notification Guidelines P a g e | 3 In its 2021 paper, the RBA established four ‘Principles for LCR in the device-not-present environment’ that industry is expected to abide by in the implementation of MCR online. This included Principle 2, which says: “If a customer has not made an explicit choice of network, and the transaction may be routed by the merchant or another party in the transaction process away from the ‘front-of-card’ network, there should be reasonable notification that routing could occur. In the case of new recurring transactions, it would be appropriate to notify customers only at the time of setting up the arrangement. In the case of existing recurring transactions, merchants should notify customers that their transactions may now be routed. The Bank is not prescribing exactly how such notifications should occur.” Objectives and Principles (a) The Guidelines’ objectives are to provide recommendations that: i. meet the Principle 2 requirement of ‘reasonable notification’; ii. meet the Principle 2 requirements with the least amount of friction and confusion caused to customers; and iii. provide additional information on transaction routing for interested customers. (b) The Guidelines are voluntary and intended to represent best practice for Acquirers, Payment Gateways and their merchants, enabling MCR Notification to be displayed to customers with minimal disruption to a customer’s online shopping experience. (c) The Guidelines are technology neutral. (d) AusPayNet does not monitor or enforce adoption of or compliance with these Guidelines by any Acquirer, Payment Gateway or their merchants. (e) AusPayNet will periodically review these guidelines to ensure they remain effective and relevant. Scope Where ‘Reasonable Notification’ is Expected: • Transactions that occur in an online environment i.e. ‘Device-Not-Present’ • Transactions undertaken using a Dual Network Debit Card • Transactions where the customer has not made an explicit choice of debit network • All ’device-not-present’ transaction types, including: o Merchant-initiated (card on file) transactions o Mobile phone transactions (i.e. transactions made in a mobile phone browser or application) o QR code payments, including both customer-presented QR codes and merchant- presented QR codes, where notification should be provided when the customer enters payment information on a website or mobile phone application. o Phone order transactions, where notification should be provided verbally Merchant Choice Routing – Online Notification Guidelines P a g e | 4 Where ‘Reasonable Notification’ is Not Expected: • ‘Device-present’ transactions (e.g. Transactions that occur in-person on a phone via a mobile wallet) • Transactions undertaken using a Single Network Debit Card, a credit card or gift card • Transactions where the customer has made an explicit choice of debit network to process the transaction • Transactions that are not routed away from

Page 15 1052300.5 7 PCI DSS Assessment Process To demonstrate compliance with the PCI DSS, merchants and service providers may be required to have annual onsite PCI DSS Assessments conducted as required by each Participating Payment Brand. PCI DSS Assessments are required to be conducted by a QSA Company through its QSA Employees (and assisting Associate QSA Employees, if applicable) in accordance with the PCI DSS, which contains requirements, testing procedures, and guidance to ensure that the intent of each requirement is understood. The QSA Employee (with assistance of Associate QSA Employees if applicable) will document in the ROC the results of the PCI DSS Assessment, including which portions of the PCI DSS Assessment were conducted onsite. The ROC must accurately represent the assessed environment and the security controls evaluated by the QSA Employee (and if applicable, assisting Associate QSA Employees). 7.1 Documenting a PCI DSS Assessment For each PCI DSS Assessment, the resulting Report on Compliance (ROC) must follow the most current ROC Reporting Template available on the Website. The ROC must be accompanied by an Attestation of Compliance (AOC), available in the Documents Library on the Website. A duly authorized officer of the QSA Company must sign the AOC, which summarizes whether the entity that was assessed is or is not in compliance with the PCI DSS, and any related findings. The intent of requiring a signature from a “duly authorized officer” is to ensure that the QSA Company is aware of and has formally signed off on the work being done and, accordingly, recognizes its obligations and responsibilities in connection with that work. Although the signatory’s job title need not include the term “officer,” the signatory must be formally authorized by the QSA Company to sign such documents on the QSA Company’s behalf and should be competent and knowledgeable regarding the Program and related requirements and duties. Each organization is different and is ultimately responsible for defining its own policies and job functions based on its own needs and culture. By signing the AOC, the assessed entity is attesting that the information provided in the AOC and accompanying Report on Compliance is true and accurate. The QSA Employee also signs the AOC. The date on the AOC cannot predate the ROC. The AOC is submitted to the requesting entity/entities according to applicable Participating Payment Brand rules. The QSA Company must inform the applicable Customer when an Associate QSA Employee has been assigned to work in connection with the PCI DSS Assessment of that Customer, and what parts of the PCI DSS Assessment the Associate QSA Employee will be participating in. Note: Merchants and service providers should consult with their acquirer or Participating Payment Brands to confirm what PCI DSS validation and reporting method is applicable. If onsite assessment and ROC is the appropriate method, they should also confirm the acceptable method of reporting per their acquirer or the Participating Payment Brands.

Page 16 1052300.5 7.2 PCI DSS Assessment Evidence Retention As per Section 4.5 “Evidence (Assessment Workpaper) Retention” of the QSA Qualification Requirements, QSA Companies must gather evidence to support the contents of each ROC. The QSA Company must secure and maintain, for a minimum of three (3) years, digital and/or hard copies of case logs, audit results, workpapers, e-mails, interview notes, and any technical information—e.g., screenshots, configuration settings—that were created and/or obtained during the PCI DSS Assessment. This information must be available upon request by PCI SSC and its affiliates. The QSA Company must also provide a copy of the evidence-retention policy and procedures to PCI SSC upon request. In cases where an Associate QSA Employee participates in the PCI DSS Assessment, the Lead QSA should ensure that a copy of the completed AQSA Engagement Summary is maintained as part of the workpapers. If a Customer refuses to provide the QSA Company with the documentary evidence—for example, because it contains information that is sensitive or confidential to the Customer—the QSA Company and the Customer should work together to ensure that the evidence is retained securely at the Customer site and as required by the QSA Qualification Requirements, including being made available upon request by PCI SSC for a minimum of three (3) years after completion of the applicable PCI DSS Assessment. It is recommended that the QSA Company and the Customer have a formal agreement that outlines each party’s responsibilities in this matter, which agreement must be consistent with and comply with the disclosure requirements specified in the QSA Agreement. Even if the actual, documented evidence is to be retained by the Customer, the QSA Company must still keep records to identify the specific evidence that was used during the PCI DSS Assessment—for example, digital and/or hard copies of the documents or testing results that are being retained by the Customer. The QSA Company’s records should clearly identify which pieces of evidence were used for each requirement, how the evidence was validated, and the findings that resulted from each piece of evidence. The QSA Company should retain enough Information to ensure that the complete, actual evidence used during the PCI DSS Assessment can be identified for retrieval if needed; for example, in the event of an investigation or if a finding needs to be reviewed.

Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (r) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure a key loading device does not retain a clear-text copy of any key it has successfully transferred.154 Reference ISO 13491-2 F8; PCI PIN SR 6-4, 13-4.4.155 Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (s) Documented procedures exist and are followed to maintain a record of every instance when a container securing cryptographic materials is opened to record date, time, person(s) involved and the purpose of the access.156 Reference ISO 11568 4.1.4; PCI PIN SR 26-1.157 Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason 153 Last amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 154 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 155 Amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 156 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 157 Amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 1 - INTRODUCTION AND MEMBER OBLIGATIONS ANNEXURE A ANNUAL SECURITY AUDITS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 53 A.3.4 General Security Controls for PIN Usage over Open Networks 158 This section addresses the minimum requirements for PIN usage in Issuer functionality offered over open networks which don’t employ secure cryptographic devices for PIN entry. This includes, but is not limited to, PIN change and delivery mechanisms, internet banking registration systems, and other internet product offerings by an Issuer (Part 3 of IAC Code Set Volume 2). (a) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure the Issuer complies with the current version of ISO 9546.1 to the maximum extent possible consistent with the Issuer’s security policies and risk management requirements. Reference IAC Code Set Volume 2, clause 2.1. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (b) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure the concurrent existence of clear text PIN and PAN is kept to the absolute minimum possible consistent with the functionality being implemented.159 Reference IAC Code Set Volume 2, clause 3.1(a)(i). Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (c) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure the Identification of the Cardholder uses additional identifying data other than that contained on or in the Card itself.160 Reference IAC Code Set Volume 2, clause 3.1(a)(ii).

Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (e) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure the Issuer uses calling-line identification only as a confirmation, not proof, of a Cardholder’s identity, and implements additional Cardholder authentication.162 Reference IAC Code Set Volume 2, clause 3.1(a)(iv). Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (f) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure all systems transporting PIN data or PAN data, or both, over open networks provide mutual assurance to the Issuer and Cardholder that they

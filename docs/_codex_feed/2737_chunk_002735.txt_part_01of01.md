after an Incident that is reasonably likely to diminish the integrity of, or otherwise interfere with or negatively affect the ability of a PFI to perform, any PFI Investigation (see the PCI Forensic Investigator (PFI) Program Guide for additional details). Failure to provide such written notification to the customer or otherwise comply with any of the above (or any other) QSA Qualification Requirements constitutes a “Violation” (see Section 6.3 below) and may result in remediation, revocation, and/or termination of the QSA Agreement. 4.6.2 Provisions The applicant QSA Company must attest (see Appendix C) that it has an internal Incident- response plan, including but not limited to: § Instructions and procedures for notifying customers of Incidents discovered during or in connection with the performance of any PCI SSC Assessment or other QSA Program- related services, and documenting those Incidents and related information in accordance with Section 4.6.1. § Retention requirement for all incident-related documentation, notices, and reports, with the same protections as those noted for work-paper retention in the QSA Company’s evidence- retention policy and procedures.

Page 21 5 QSA List and Annual Re-Qualification This section describes what happens after initial qualification, and activities related to annual re- qualification. 5.1 QSA List Once a company has met applicable QSA Qualification Requirements, PCI SSC will add the QSA Company to the QSA List on the Website. Once an individual has met applicable QSA Requirements, PCI SSC will add the Assessor-Employee to the applicable Assessor-Employee search tool on the Website. Only those QSA Companies and Assessor-Employees on the QSA List or in such search tool (as applicable) are recognized by PCI SSC to perform or support PCI DSS Assessments. If, at any time, a QSA Company and/or Assessor-Employee does not meet the applicable QSA Requirements (including without limitation, payment or documentation requirements), PCI SSC reserves the right to immediately remove the QSA Company and/or Assessor-Employee from the respective list(s) or tool(s) on the Website, regardless of Remediation or Revocation. PCI SSC will notify the QSA Company of the removal in accordance with the QSA Agreement, typically via registered or overnight mail and/or e-mail. Refer to Sections 6.2 and 6.3 below for additional information relating to Remediation and Revocation. 5.2 Annual Re-Qualification 5.2.1 Requirements All QSA Companies must be re-qualified, regionally, by PCI SSC on an annual basis. The annual re-qualification date is based upon the QSA Company’s original qualification date (on a per- region basis). Re-qualification requires payment of annual training and re-qualification fees, and continued compliance with applicable QSA Requirements. Additionally, each Assessor-Employee must be re-qualified by PCI SSC on an annual basis. The annual re-qualification date is based upon the Assessor-Employee’s previous qualification date. Re-qualification requires proof of CPEs as noted in Section 5.2.2, proof of training successfully completed, payment of annual training and re-qualification fees, and continued compliance with applicable QSA Requirements. Negative feedback from QSA Company clients (merchants, service providers, etc.), PCI SSC, Participating Payment Brands, or others may impact QSA Company and/or Assessor-Employee eligibility for re-qualification.

Page 23 6 Assessor Quality Management Program The PCI SSC’s Assessor Quality Management (AQM) team exists to monitor and review assessor work in order to provide reasonable assurance that assessors maintain a baseline standard of quality. 6.1 QSA Audit Process The purpose of the ongoing QSA audit process is to confirm that each QSA Company is maintaining documented quality processes in accordance with this document and the QSA Company’s internal quality assurance program, as well as to gain assurance that assessor work is at a level consistent with the baseline objectives of the PCI DSS and supporting PCI SSC documentation. PCI SSC reserves the right to audit a QSA Company at any time, and further reserves the right to conduct site visits, at the expense of the QSA Company. Once selected for audit by AQM, the QSA Company will be notified, typically via PCI SSC’s secure assessor web portal for the QSA Program (the “Portal”).

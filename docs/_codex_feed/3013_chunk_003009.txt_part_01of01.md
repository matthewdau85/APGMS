which is sent directly to the PSP. 6. The PSP receives cardholder data and sends to payment system for authorization.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 17 2.4.3 Merchant Impact As the merchant controls the manner in which cardholder data is collected and transmitted to the PSP, the same PCI DSS controls apply as with the Direct Post Method described above (Section 2.3). Merchants using a JavaScript e-commerce implementation may be eligible for PCI SAQ A-EP, providing they meet the eligibility criteria of that SAQ. Merchants should consult with their acquirer (merchant bank) or with the payment brands directly to determine whether they are required to validate their PCI DSS compliance and which reporting method they should use. SAQ A-EP for PCI DSS v3.2 currently includes 191 requirements. 2.4.4 Recommendations All recommendations for the Direct Post Method also apply to the JavaScript Form payment method. The decision to choose one method over the other may be an architectural decision overall. With Direct Post, the merchant will lose control over the session momentarily, whereas with JavaScript, the merchant can maintain some level of control over the session by watching for a timeout and seamlessly delivering an error message to the customer. The decision also depends on the PSP and how the PSP has built what the merchant is using. The merchant should discuss with its PSP. 2.5 The Application Programming Interface (API) Merchant e-commerce systems that receive or store cardholder card data (even temporarily) require greater security controls than the previously discussed methods. In the payment methods discussed earlier in this document, risks are minimized due to payment service providers receiving cardholder data directly from the customer, reducing security responsibility for merchant systems. The merchant system’s handling of cardholder data in the API method may require that the entire set of PCI DSS controls be applied to the merchant’s in-scope systems, people, and processes. 2.5.1 What is an API? In this context, an application-programming interface (API) is a method of system-to-system data transmission wherein the merchant principally controls the progress of the payment transaction. Customer cardholder data is sent from the customer browser back to the merchant website before being sent to the PSP. Data sent to the PSP may be sent in different formats such as XML, JSON, or name/value pairs. The payment page and form are hosted and supplied by the merchant website with all cardholder data processed by the merchant web server (and possibly other system components) before being sent to the payment solution provider. 2.5.2 The API Process 1. Merchant creates payment page. 2. Customer’s browser displays the payment form.

The customer enters cardholder data into the payment form and the data is sent to merchant web server. 4. The merchant web server transmits cardholder data to the PSP. 5. The PSP receives cardholder data and sends it to the payment system for authorization.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 19 2.5.3 Merchant Impact This architecture carries a high risk for merchants as their systems will receive and transmit, and may also store and process, cardholder data. Hackers target websites using this payment method because there is a greater chance of larger amounts of valuable cardholder data being available, and the attack can be easier due to varying levels of security controls among merchants. Due to the higher risk of compromise to merchant systems, the level of security responsibly for the merchant is high. Merchants using the API e-commerce payment method may be eligible for SAQ D, providing they meet the eligibility criteria of that SAQ. Merchants should consult with their acquirer (merchant bank) or with the payment brands directly to determine whether they are required to validate their PCI DSS compliance and which reporting method they should use. SAQ D for Merchants for PCI DSS v3.2 currently includes 250 questions. 2.5.4 Recommendations For smaller merchants, this may not be a cost-effective e-commerce payment route due to the associated level of security responsibly. The API method is generally used by larger organizations with specific processing needs, or organizations that wish to retain cardholder data. The applicable controls to secure all systems, people, and processes within an organization for PCI DSS compliance should not be underestimated. Merchants are advised not to store, process, or transmit cardholder within their own systems unless the nature of their payment acceptance is not compatible with any of the other models described previously. 2.6 Wholly Outsourced E-commerce Solutions Many e-commerce solutions exist that provide most or the entire merchant’s online shopping functionality and experience. These solutions provide more than just transaction processing capability, often including customer-facing features such as product search, cart capability, checkout, and account management; and back-office features such as product management, customer relationship management, order management, and appearance customizations.

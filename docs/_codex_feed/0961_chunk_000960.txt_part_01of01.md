sort of history with the position that I did at different assignments in, the countries that I moved to, to where I am now. Alicia Malone: I love that story. You just never know where life is going to take you. What do you enjoy most about what you do, and what do you find are the biggest challenges that you encounter? Sharon Gai: I think I am so blessed and fortunate to be in the position that I am. I feel like I have put myself in a self-programmed PhD program that I made up and I designed. I have these modules of learning that I have to go through. I have to write a quote unquote “dissertation”, which is my upcoming book. It feels like a PhD dissertation, but it's basically compiled everything that I have learned and know about things that's happening in the AI space and also my opinions and my insights. And, I then have to fly around the world and go to different events and stages and tell people about pieces of my dissertation. So, I feel like I've put myself in a makeshift PhD program in a way and what better position can I be to be in a paid place to be a student, to be a lifelong student of learning. And so, I think that's what I thoroughly enjoy is that ability to learn, absorb things, but also to tell people about the important things that I have come across and that I have learned. My challenge, I would say, is I think navigating through the uncertainty. I think many of us, especially with what's happening in the AI space, whether you are a student, whether you are a company leader, whether you are a knowledge worker, or working at any sort of company, it's very uncertain. I think the ability to navigate between what is noise and what is signal is a very important skill. And it's one that I have come to get to know myself and get better and better at. But I think that's still a challenge that I have in trying to navigate all the different pieces of data and information that's amongst us and to sift through all of that noise, and to pinpoint myself to a place in the future where the future becomes less and less uncertain. Alicia Malone: In the world of e-commerce and digital strategy, identifying market risks and interpreting consumer data is critical, much like how other industries rely on data to make their high-stakes decisions. Can you walk us through how you use data and insights to guide strategy and reduce business risks in your work? Sharon Gai: So, to backtrack a bit, to introduce you to sort of the world of e-commerce in China and Alibaba as a whole, it is a very data-driven company. So, because of the number of users, first of all, there's about a billion or so internet users in China. All of them have their own micro behaviors and the way that they interact with apps. But each of those little micro behaviors, so the amount of even microseconds you're staying on a product detail page or the number of swipes you're swiping on a page, as all product detail pages have about nine images, at which point of looking at one of those images did you actually add that product to cart or did it actually make you buy the product? All of those micro behaviors make up the fuller picture of what that customer likes and doesn't like and what makes them buy or not buy something. And so, the power with a company like Alibaba and Chinese e-commerce at large is it's very good at knowing their customers very well. And so, previously in my roles, I would work with teams like TMIC. Which is a T-Mall Innovation Center, an internal team where we would match together, where we would match the data that we had internally with a brand and look at what new products should this brand be making so that it would sell more product. Because oftentimes in R & D departments, they're sort of looking at general market research or they're downloading information from a Gartner to look at where this larger industry is going or where things are trending. And then, they would go and make that product. So, for instance, in an example with Coca-Cola, for instance, what new flavor of lemonade could we come out with next? And so, the more traditional route is to go through these different layers of either data providers or market research focus groups to gather all of that data for your R & D teams to assemble this and to create a product and then to put online to sell. In a newer way of product creation is you go directly to this e-commerce platform, or you'd go directly to the selling point, the platform where you'll actually sell this product and get them to tell you what are your people buying, what are your users clicking on and interested in and searching for, and then telling that data to your R &D team. So, it makes product creation a lot faster. And it also reduces a lot of business risk and risk of you maybe creating a product that your R & D team thought was going to

What is the role of the PCI SSC Brazil Regional Engagement Board? The PCI SSC Brazil Regional Engagement Board serves in an advisory role to PCI SSC. Regional Advisors will represent the perspectives of Participating Organizations and stakeholders in Brazil, advising and providing feedback and guidance to PCI SSC on standards, program development, and adoption in Brazil. Why did PCI SSC establish the Brazil Regional Engagement Board? Improving and increasing industry involvement in the development of PCI standards and resources is critical to the Council’s mission to enhance global payment security. PCI SSC established the Regional Engagement Board in Brazil to assist in exchanging information and increasing payment security through adoption of PCI standards in this important region. What are the responsibilities of Brazil Regional Engagement Board members? Board member responsibilities include providing advice, feedback, and guidance to PCI SSC as requested relating to payment data security issues, trends, and market changes in the region; representing the views and interests of regional constituents; assisting in the recruitment of new Participating Organizations and stakeholders; recommending agenda topics for the Regional Engagement Board meetings; and participating as needed in PCI SSC initiatives and projects. Board members will be expected to attend and participate in regular board meetings, which include: telephone conference meetings and one annual face-to- face meeting. Additional telephone-based meetings of the Regional Engagement Board may be called by PCI SSC as needed. How is the role of the PCI SSC Engagement Board different from the PCI SSC Board of Advisors? The Regional Engagement Board is focused on specific geographies and markets where increased input and engagement is needed to foster broad adoption of PCI security standards, whereas the Board of Advisors represents PCI SSC Participating Organizations worldwide to ensure global industry involvement in the development of PCI security standards. However, there will be an exchange of information and feedback both ways so that both groups will benefit from the topics and areas being discussed.

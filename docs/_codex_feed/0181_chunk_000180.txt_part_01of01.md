Our fourth Milestones Report, shows Australian consumers are continuing to move away from cheques and cash in favour of cards and other electronic payments. Today’s Report shows that cheque use in Australia dropped 13.9 per cent in 2014 to 167 million. This compares to an 8.8 per cent increase in the use of payment cards and a 7.5 per cent increase in direct entry payments (direct debits and direct credits). The Report also shows that consumers are using less cash. In 2014, the number of ATM cash withdrawals dropped by 4.8 per cent to 741 million and by 2.1 per cent in value to $143 billion.

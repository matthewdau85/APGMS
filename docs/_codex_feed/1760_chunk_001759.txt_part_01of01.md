Australian Payments Plus (AP+) is today pleased to report the overwhelming success of its first summit – Beyond Tomorrow: Inspiring Trust in The Digital Economy . Well… after a whirlwind of activity, I’m delighted to report that Australian Payments Plus’ inaugural Beyond Tomorrow Summit was a resounding success, with 400 delegates, 35 speakers, eight panels, two stages, one keynote conversation and one big wave surfer! As Australia’s domestic payments infrastructure operator and the operator of ConnectID, AP+ is uniquely positioned to host an event on “Inspiring trust in the digital economy”. In the digital economy, consumers don’t just buy goods and services; they buy experiences. To build trust, companies must demonstrate authenticity, transparency, honesty, and reliability. Our first AP+ summit came only one month after the 2nd anniversary of our founding. Integrating three businesses while continuing to run critical payments systems is no mean feat. As the CEO, I am proud of where we are today. Our teams are committed to delivering for our members and for the payments industry and take tremendous pride in the unique role that we play. In 2022, we processed 3.9 billion transactions and in 2023 that number grew to more than 4.8 billion.

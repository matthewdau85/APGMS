PCI SSC reserves the right to audit a QPA Company at any time, and further reserves the right to conduct site visits, at the expense of the QPA Company. Once selected for audit by AQM, the QPA Company will be notified, typically via PCI SSC’s secure assessor web portal for the QPA Program (the “Portal”). The notification will specify the Assessment Results and Related Materials the QPA Company is expected to provide over the course of the audit, which may include but is not limited to internal QA manuals, documented processes such as the Workpaper Retention Policy, PIN ROCs redacted in accordance with PCI SSC policy, and workpapers. The AQM team will review the PIN ROCs, supporting documentation and the QPA Company’s internal QA manual to determine whether the organization’s internal QA processes are sufficiently documented in line with the above requirements and that they are being followed. 6.2 QPA Quality Remediation Process QPA Companies that do not meet all applicable quality assurance standards set by PCI SSC may be offered the option to participate in PCI SSC’s QPA Company Quality Remediation program (“Remediation”) . Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, PCI SSC may offer Remediation in connection with any quality assurance audit, any Violation (defined below) or any other quality concern relating to the QPA Program, including but not limited to unsatisfactory feedback from QPA Company customers or Participating Payment Brands. When a QPA Company qualifies for Remediation, the QPA Company will be notified in accordance with the QPA Agreement, typically via registered or overnight mail and/or e-mail. Once the QPA Company signs the agreement to participate (“Remediation Agreement”) and pays the fee(s) required in the notification, the applicable listing on the QPA List will be annotated with “In Remediation” and the listing will display the QPA Company’s details in red text. Refer to the Website – PCI SSC Programs Fee Schedule for details of all applicable fees. At the time of notification that the QPA Company qualifies for Remediation, AQM will provide the QPA Company with information on the requirements and procedures of the Remediation process and what it entails. Once AQM has gained sufficient assurance of quality improvement and the requirements of the Remediation Agreement have been fulfilled, Remediation ends, and the QPA Company’s listing on the Website returns to “In Good Standing” in black text. QPA Companies that fail to satisfy Remediation requirements may be revoked, and QPA Companies electing not to participate in Remediation when eligible will be revoked.

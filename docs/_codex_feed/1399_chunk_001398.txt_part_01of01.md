Under the taxable payments reporting system (TPRS), some businesses may need to report the total payments they made to contractors for relevant services. Also government entities may need to report payments they made for services and grants paid to people and organisations with an Australian business number (ABN). These payments need to be reported to the ATO in a Taxable payments annual report (TPAR) by 28 August each year. See also Not required report There are certain circumstances where TPAR reporting is not required. For more information, visit TPAR Non-lodgment advice .

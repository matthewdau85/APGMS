the security of the resources to which they provide access. If not properly developed, managed and secured, these interfaces can be exploited or compromised, resulting in unexpected behavior and potentially unauthorized access. For example, a poorly coded API could result in weak authentication protocols, poor access controls or limited auditing capability. Such weaknesses could lead to the exposure of service functionality or sensitive data. If the APIs are not properly secured, they could also be exploited or altered by an attacker to redirect data flows or alter application behavior. APIs and other public interfaces should be designed to prevent both accidental misuse and malicious attempts to bypass security controls. Resilient authentication and access controls, strong cryptography and real-time monitoring are examples of controls that should be in place to protect these interfaces. When consuming APIs exposed by a Provider, it is important to ensure that all applicable PCI DSS requirements are met. For example, all API calls affecting cardholder data and the cardholder data environment must be logged and reviewed per PCI DSS Requirement 10. Or, when invoking a web services call that transmits cardholder data, it should be over an encrypted tunnel (e.g., SOAP native encryption or a TLS tunnel). E.14 Identity and Access Management Individual user identification and authentication for both Provider and Customer personnel is essential for access control and accountability (see PCI DSS Requirements 7 and 8). Shared credentials (such as user accounts and passwords) should not be used in the Provider environmentfor example, for system administration and maintenancenor should generic or shared accounts be assigned to or used by Customers. The use of a single Customer credential that covers multiple cloud services for that Customer is also a potential concern. For example, let us say that a Provider issues a Customer a user account and password that has administrator privileges in one environment and user-level privileges for a separate, unrelated cloud service. Compromise of the Customer’s user-level account in the second environment could therefore result in the attacker gaining administrator-level access to the first environment. Customer accounts and passwords should be unique for each service, and any account with elevated privilege (such as administrator) should be restricted for a specific service or function, and not used for activities or access that do not require such privilege. In certain scenarios, a multi- factor authentication may be required to access resources hosted in the cloud. For example, PCI DSS Requirement 8.2.2 requires multi-factor authentication for all remote network access to the CDE, and when public cloud services are part of a Customer’s CDE, all such access will be considered remote access and will require multi-factor authentication. The PCI Security Standards Council has published the Information Supplement Multi-Factor Authentication, which provides further guidance on the topic of multi-factor authentication.32 32 PCI Security Standards Council, Multi-Factor Authentication (PCI SSC, February 2017), https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/Multi-Factor-Authentication-Guidance-v1.pdf. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 74 E.15 Logging and Audit Trails The ability to maintain an accurate and complete audit trail may require logs from all levels of the infrastructure, requiring involvement from both the Provider and the Customer. For example, the Provider could manage system-level, operating system and hypervisor logs, while the Customer configures logging for its own VMs and applications. In this scenario, the ability to organize various log files into meaningful events would require correlation of Customer-controlled logs with those controlled by the Provider. Providers are responsible for providing log data for resources managed by the Provider (for example, logs for infrastructure components (IaaS), logs for platform components (PaaS), logs for software components (SaaS), etc.). Providers should be able to segregate log data applicable to each Customer and provide it to each respective Customer for analysis without exposing log data from other Customers. In addition, the Provider must implement controls to protect the collected log data, including protection from unauthorized viewing, copying, printing, forwarding, editing and deleting. Customers are responsible for ensuring that logging is enabled for components that are not managed by the Provider (e.g., application logs, event logs, etc.). In addition, Customers should ensure that log aggregation, correlation and monitoring are in place as required for all log sources, including the determination of log correlation and monitoring criteria. In an example scenario of shared logging responsibility, the Provider could manage system-level, operating system and hypervisor logs, while the Customer configures logging for its own VMs and applications. The ability to organize various log files into meaningful events would often require correlation of Customer-controlled logs with those controlled by the Provider. Customers may choose to implement third-party correlation and monitoring tools or implement an in-house solution. At a minimum, the aggregated audit trail should contain information to reconstruct the events listed in PCI DSS Requirement 10.2 with sufficient details for the auditable events as required in PCI DSS Requirement 10.3. Finally, the collected logs should be retained for at least one year, per PCI DSS Requirement 10.7. The PCI Security Standards Council has published the Information Supplement Effective Daily Log Monitoring, which is intended to provide further information and guidance to help organizations address the challenges of maintaining effective log-management processes as applicable to the PCI DSS environment.33 33 Effective Daily Log Monitoring Special Interest Group and PCI Data Security Standards Council, Effective Daily Log Monitoring, (PCI

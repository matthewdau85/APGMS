The direct entry rules include how financial institutions can help customers with their direct debit arrangements by: acting on any request to stop, cancel or amend a direct debit arrangement taking steps to ensure no further direct debits are made to the account once the arrangement is cancelled working with the collecting business’s financial institution to resolve any disputes around direct debit payments. Processing and clearing Direct entry is the workhorse of the Australian payments system carrying average yearly values of more than $15 trillion. One of direct entry’s features is its relative low cost because volumes are high and payments are batched. Financial institutions exchange payments in bulk, six times a day on weekdays (10.00am, 1.00pm, 4.00pm, 6.30pm, 8.45pm and 10.30pm). Settlement occurs on the same-day after each of the first five official exchanges. For further details, please refer to cl. 4.2 of the BECS Procedures . Same-day settlement was introduced in November 2013 to reduce counterparty and operational risk. It also gives financial institutions flexibility in developing products to suit customers’ needs. Direct entry user numbers Direct entry payments include a unique six-digit number which identifies companies approved by financial institutions to use the system. This number is referred to as a ‘DE User ID’ and is issued by AusPayNet via the sponsoring financial institutions. Information We produce guidelines and brochures and general information to help existing users of the direct entry system understand how it works. For more specific information on the direct entry system, or to become a direct entry user, please contact your financial institution. Developments BECS Transition In June 2023, the Australian Government released its Strategic Plan for Australia’s Payments System . One key priority was modernising payments infrastructure, where the Government expressed support for an industry-led transition away from the legacy BECS Framework, in favour of more modern account-to-account payments alternatives. AusPayNet has established the BECS Transition program, to ensure any transition away from BECS is managed responsibly, with no disruption to the efficient and secure flow of essential payments.

Common Payments Network We established the COIN as part of a wider physical connectivity network for payments. In addition to the COIN, the CPN includes the SWIFT network, and the Reserve Bank’s (RBA’s) clearing interconnector which enables payments traffic to pass between the COIN and SWIFT. Together, the COIN, the RBA Network Interconnector and the SWIFT FileAct Service provide for a common payments network in Australia.

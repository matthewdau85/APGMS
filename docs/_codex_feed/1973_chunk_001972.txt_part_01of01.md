Authorise, view and manage payments in one place Once you authorise a PayTo agreement, payments are processed according to the terms you’ve agreed to. That means you're in control of how much money can be debited. Agreements can also be viewed and managed in one secure place, making it easy for you to stay on top of your payments.

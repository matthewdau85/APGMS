VoIP telephone systems) containing CHD sent over open or public networks. Examples of open, public networks include but are not limited to the Internet, wireless technologies such as 802.11 and Bluetooth, cellular technologies, and satellite communications.  Configure firewalls and network controls to prevent unauthorized transmissions of call-recording data to any network segment or device without a legitimate business need to access this data.  Never send CHD over an unencrypted, end-user messaging medium such as chat, social media, SMS (short message service)/text, or e-mail, or other non-encrypted communication channel.  Ensure that systems such as IVR, for example, do not output cardholder data in any logs.  For the home/remote worker supported as an extension of the entity’s network, make sure that their environment is secure in accordance with the PCI DSS and any controls agreed with your acquirer or payment card brand.

Some telephony services may also offer secure configuration options. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) both have secure variantsSIPS and SRTP, respectivelywhich may help protect the data connection process and data stream. Please refer to Appendix E, “Further Considerations on VoIP,” for more information. 5.2.3 Desktop Systems Desktops within the telephone environment may involve a variety of technologies, including desktop applications for payment acceptance, web browsers, iframes hosted by third parties to the agent organization, as well as virtual desktops, thin clients, remote desktop connections to other systems, or other applications intended to replace conventional workstations for contact center agents. Because these are the endpoints where agents hear payment card data spoken on a telephone then enter those data elements accordingly, the endpoint at which the agent enters the data is in scope for PCI DSS. This endpoint transmits payment card data, and the organization must consider applicable PCI DSS requirements for these systems, as well as for any connected-to or security-impacting systems around it. 5.2.4 Softphones Many organizations are leveraging newer features of telephone systems including the use of software phones (softphones) which are software programs used to make a voice call over the network. Softphones will typically be installed on an end user’s workstation with either a headset or a USB-style phone used for the conversation. It is important to note that the use of such systems to capture payment card account data would bring the workstationand probably the network it is connected tointo PCI DSS scope. For more information, refer to the Information Supplement, Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation, mentioned in Appendix G. This Guidance is intended to provide further understanding of scoping and segmentation principles as applicable to a PCI DSS environment. 5.2.5 Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) DTMF is the sound one can hear when pressing the buttons on a telephone keyboard, a different tone, or frequency is associated with each digit key. It is easy for trained hears to recognize a number from the tones generated by a telephone keyboard. DTMF suppression is removing these tones, DTMF masking is replacing the tones by either a random tone or a flat tone. DTMF masking will be explored further in Section 6. Depending on how it is deployed and whether it transmits payment card account data, DTMF masking is one of the technologies that can be used to reduce the risk to account data in the environment.

Any such requirements the organization may be subject to should be defined and incorporated into the data-retention policy. Organizations should consider the use of technologies which prevent CHD entering the call recording, while allowing the full call to be recorded To ensure the security of any CHD within call recordings, the recording of a verbal transmission of CHD, or where DTMF tones are processed unaltered, must be correctly stored and secured in accordance with PCI DSS requirements. Additionally, the capture and storage of screens or video recordings where CHD is visible must be equally secured. Every possible effort must be made to eliminate SAD from the telephone environment. If an organization has a legitimate constraint that prevents it from removing SAD from its recordings, the organization should discuss this with its acquirer and/or payment brand. If SAD cannot be eliminated, it must be secured in a manner consistent with PCI DSS and must not be able to be queried Appendix D, “Call Recording Decision-making Process,” illustrates some high-level decision points related to the presence of SAD in call recordings. CHD should only be stored as necessary to meet the needs of the business and, to comply with local laws and regulations. If any CHD is stored, an appropriate data-retention policy to ensure that the data

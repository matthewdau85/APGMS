and NPP payment volumes NPP share of account-to-account transactions Supporting users to assess NPP costs and value. The costs of operating the NPP are largely fixed. As the volume of payments processed by the NPP continues to grow, the per-transaction cost will continue to decline. The implied average wholesale transaction cost at the scheme level has decreased from $0.39 in 2019 to $0.04 in FY25. NPP transaction costs cannot be assessed in isolation. It’s important to recognise the less visible efficiency savings that the NPP delivers such as major reductions in manual reconciliation and reduction in failed or mistaken payments. Uplifting the technical infrastructure capability of the NPP platform. Alongside the payments migration work, AP+ is driving two parallel projects to uplift the technical infrastructure capability of the NPP platform. One of these projects is an upgrade to the most recent ISO 20022 payments messaging standards. ISO 20022 will be the common language of the global financial industry, introducing many new data fields for the transmission of payments, strengthening operational resilience in payments and enhancing straight-through processing. The second project, SWIFT cloud enablement, will facilitate Participants moving their own infrastructure to cloud environments to take advantage of reduced costs and more efficient use of technology. In addition to these areas of focus, AP+ is working closely with current payment scheme Participants on their NPP priorities including: Connecting accounts that currently send and receive payments via BECS to the NPP. At present, the NPP reaches 90 per cent of all BECS reachable accounts. NPP Participants have plans in place to connect nearly all the remaining accounts well before the retirement of BECS. AP+ will continue to work with Participants and the broader industry to resolve any remaining reach gaps well ahead of the BECS decommission timeframe. Working with financial institutions to drive improvements to reliability of their NPP services . The central NPP infrastructure is distributed architecture with multiple production and back-up sites. Since its launch in 2018, it has been highly resilient with zero failures of the central NPP infrastructure. Participants continue to build resilience and capacity in their NPP processing and systems. In recent years progress in these strategic deployments have unfortunately seen planned and unplanned outages for individual Participants. These outages continue to be reduced whilst recovery times have improved and impacts to payments minimised. To compare, these Participant outages have been significantly shorter in duration than the time between transaction processing windows on the legacy BECS infrastructure. All NPP Participants must meet stringent availability requirements of no more than two minutes outage per month. The consequences for failure to meet these requirements include non-compliance charges which range into millions of dollar penalties. AP+ will continue to work with NPP Participants to drive improvements in resilience. Unlocking the potential of modern payments Australia can look forward to a payments system where: payments get made in real time every hour of everyday, employees receive their salaries as soon as they’re paid, emergency assistance payments in times of crisis can reach people’s accounts in seconds, and organisations can save time and money with more efficient payment workflows. These are just some of benefits that the NPP delivers through real time data rich payments. As we move forward with the move to the NPP, AP+ will continue to collaborate closely with the industry to navigate the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in reshaping Australia’s future of payments.

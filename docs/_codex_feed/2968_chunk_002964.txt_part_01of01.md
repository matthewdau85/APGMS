Customer and the Provider. This may be due to the requirement applying to elements present in both the Customer environment and the Provider managed environment, or because both parties need to be involved in the management of a particular control. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 14 Appendix A includes additional considerations for determining how PCI DSS responsibilities may be assigned for each cloud service category. Appendix C illustrates a sample PCI DSS Responsibility Matrix, as guidance for how Providers and Customers can document PCI DSS responsibility assignments. The concept of shared or joint responsibility can be particularly tricky to deal with. While some services and functions will be relatively straightforward to scope and establish boundaries, many services and functions will overlap if not clearly demarcated at the outset of the service relationship. Where the Provider maintains responsibility for PCI DSS controls, the Customer is still responsible for monitoring the Provider’s ongoing compliance for all applicable requirements. Providers should be able to provide their Customers with ongoing assurance that requirements are being met, and where the Provider is managing requirements on behalf of the Customer, it should have mechanisms in place to provide the Customer with the applicable records to demonstrate that the requires security controls are in placefor example, audit logs showing all access to Customer data. Customers are still required to validate their compliance in accordance with payment brand programs.

Shared Shared Shared PCI DSS Appendix A1: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Shared Hosting Providers Provider Provider Provider Note: The sample responsibilities illustrated in this table do not include consideration for any activities or operations performed outside a hypothetical cloud service offering. This table provides an example of the ways in which PCI DSS responsibilities might be assigned for different cloud service categories. However, each Provider ultimately defines its own service and particular service offerings may or may not be consistent with those illustrated above. Customers and Providers should clearly document their responsibilities as applicable to their particular agreements.

While SECaaS solutions are not directly involved in storing, processing or transmitting CHD, it may still be an integral part of the security of the CDE, and therefore it is important to understand for which PCI DSS controls the SECaaS Provider is responsible. As an example, a SaaS-based anti-malware solution may be used to update anti-malware signatures on the Customer’s systems via a cloud- delivery model. In this example, the SECaaS offering is delivering a PCI DSS control to the Customer’s environment, and the SECaaS functionality will need to be reviewed to verify that it is meeting the applicable requirements. SECaaS can vary in complexity from a relatively simple cloud-based application subscription model to complex outsourcing of entire security functions such as a Security Operation Center (SOC) or a Network Operation Center (NOC) using cloud-delivery models. The number of applicable PCI DSS requirements that fall under the responsibility of the SECaaS Provider will increase relative to the complexity of the service being provided. Merchants using SECaaS must include SECaaS service providers in the list of PCI service providers, and ensure compliance with, at the very least, PCI DSS Requirements 12.8.1 – 12.8.5 for each SECaaS service provider used. 4.4 Segmentation Considerations Outside a cloud environment, individual entity environments would normally be physically, organizationally and administratively separate from each other. Customers utilizing a public or otherwise shared cloud must ensure that their environments are adequately isolated from the other cloud tenants. In addition to enforcing separation between Customer environments, segmentation may also be desired within a Customer’s environment to isolate its CDE components from non-CDE components in order to

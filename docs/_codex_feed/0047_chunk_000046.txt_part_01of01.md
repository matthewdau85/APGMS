AusPayNet’s 2022 Annual Review, “Paving the way” provides a snapshot of the work we are undertaking to facilitate the future of payments in Australia. Some key highlights include: We introduced a Payment Service Provider (PSP) membership category, recognising the expansion of the industry beyond its traditional participants and ensuring greater representation in decision-making. Ten PSP members have been onboarded to date. We continue to lead the migration to the ISO 20022 payments messaging for the High Value Clearing System. The build phase was completed in March 2022, and the industry test phase has since progressed successfully As part of our governance review, we commenced a process with the ultimate goal of ensuring our readiness to become an authorised standards setting body for payments. Our new payment acceptance governance approach for the approval of devices and solutions went live and has been well received by industry participants. We published voluntary guidelines for QR codes as a payment method, enabling merchants to offer their consumers another quick, efficient means of digital payment. We continued our commitment to making Australia a hard target for scams by developing a scams mitigation program alongside the Australian Banking Association (ABA), Australian Financial Crime Exchange (AFCX) and IDCARE.

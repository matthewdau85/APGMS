To ensure your business information within RAM is protected: Each person who accesses RAM or online services must have their own Digital ID – for further security set up your Digital ID to the highest identity strength you can achieve. Regularly review and maintain your business authorisations in RAM and remove authorisations immediately when they are no longer valid. Only authorise others to access government online services they need to use to complete their work. Keep your details up to date within RAM. Keep the business’s details up to date on the Australian Business Register. Check the business History for authorisation and machine credential activities. Be wary of potential scams. Staying safe online is also an important part of protecting your personal and business information. Keep your personal information and passwords secure – don't share your password with others and change your passwords regularly. Use a strong password or passphrase to protect your account. Treat requests for personal information with caution. Never reply to communications with your password or other sensitive information. Install anti-virus software on all devices and set the software to automatically check for updates on a daily basis. Store your ID documents and personal information securely, don’t store them in emails and be careful who you share these with.

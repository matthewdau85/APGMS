The Annual Meeting Fosters Collaboration and Innovation in The Payments Security Industry PORTLAND , Ore. 14 September 2023 — More than 1,200 in-person and online stakeholders attended the PCI SSC Global Community Meeting , a collaborative forum for leaders in the payment security industry. The multi-day event featured discussions on the upcoming March 2024 retirement of PCI DSS v3.2.1, insights into the latest threats to payment security, and the importance of cross industry collaboration to defend against these threats. “The North America Community Meeting is a vital opportunity for the industry to come together and exchange ideas on payment security,” said PCI SSC Executive Director Lance J. Johnson. “As an industry-driven organization, our global payment security standards and programs rely on insights from the payments community to ensure they remain steadfast against threats and keep pace with the rapid change of payment technology.” Recent changes to the Council’s Participating Organization Program provide the industry with expanded opportunity to contribute, collaborate, and influence the direction of these standards and programs. Principal Participating Organizations can now provide input to the Council via the following groups: Roadmap Roundtable Group (RRG) Members of the RRG play a key part in the Council’s annual strategic planning process and help to drive the Council’s direction and strategic initiatives. Technology Guidance Group (TGG) The TGG provides proactive technical oversight for the Council’s standards and programs. Members have the opportunity to provide input to Council standards during the development process prior to the release of RFCs. On stage, Emma Sutcliffe, SVP, Standards and Andrew Jamieson, VP, Solutions, presented to attendees how the Council is updating the Standards development process to increase industry input. “PCI DSS v4.0 is a great example of the Council reacting to the industry’s need for more flexibility and deeper security guidance,” said Emma Sutcliffe. “The newly formed RRG and TTG provide new opportunities for industry feedback throughout the standards development process. The aim is to ensure our standards protect against current and future threats to payment security while enabling payment technology innovation.” Top of mind for many in the industry is the March 2024 retirement of PCI DSS v3.2.1. Stakeholders were able to discuss the transition to PCI DSS v4.0 with Council staff. On-stage PCI DSS v4.0 presentations highlighted some of the many resources to help the industry with the transition: PCI DSS v4.0 Resources New Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) documents: Find the newly-published Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) Instructions and Guidelines and SAQ for Software-based PIN Entry on COTS solutions (SPoC) for PCI DSS v4.0 in the PCI SSC Document Library .

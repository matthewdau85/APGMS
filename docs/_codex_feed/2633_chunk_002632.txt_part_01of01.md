system when evaluating security control effectiveness. System sampling, when implemented with caution and awareness, is another mechanism that can make continuous monitoring more cost-effective. Selecting a sample of information systems rather than performing a full inspection of all systems can be a valuable and efficient means of monitoring security control state and effectiveness, particularly in cases where security controls and monitoring mechanisms are not automated. Unfortunately, employing sampling is not without risk due to the possibility that security controls may have failed on specific systems or that systems not following approved configuration standards may have been deployed and thus may go undetected. Another risk associated with sampling is that the sample population may fail to capture the variations in control-review results that would otherwise be obtained from a review of the full population. This variance could result in an inaccurate view of the effectiveness of the assessed security controls and ultimately the security posture of the organization. To minimize exposure, organizations should consider the overall scope and complexity of the assessed environment in order to determine an appropriate sample. The risks associated with sampling can be avoided when continuous control monitoring or data analysis of the entire population is available using a variety of properly configured tools. For example, when code reviews are documented in automated source-code management tools, the entire population can be evaluated for segregation of duties between the coder and the reviewer and whether code reviews and approvals are completed prior to implementation.

These exact measures and metrics provide a real-time barometer of the health of a control or set of controls. If sampling is going to be used, it is critical to gain an understanding of the population characteristics before deciding sample-selection methodology and sample size. If the population size is under 10 instances (e.g., systems, people, physical locations, etc.), it probably makes sense to examine the entire population instead of sampling since the likelihood of a valid sample is quite low. When, however, a population size exceeds 100 instances, it may be reasonable to consider a sampling methodology. With that in mind, the population size alone should not be the sole input to the sampling methodology. Considerations for determining sample size should include the level of confidence that is necessary to ensure that any risk has been addressed by the control and the organization’s risk tolerance for sampling errors. The lower the tolerance for errors, the higher the confidence level necessary. Internal audit department or sample size calculators12 13 14 can be consulted to determine the exact sample size necessary for a specific population size and confidence interval level. If sampling is appropriate for the organization, the Compliance Manager should consider the following guidelines when independently selecting representative samples of business facilities and system components for use during interim evaluations of PCI DSS controls: ▪ Samples should be a representative selection of all types and locations of business facilities. ▪ Samples of system components should include every type and combination in use. ▪ Samples should also include each type of system deployed at each selected business facility. ▪ Samples must be sufficiently large to provide assurance that controls are implemented as expected. ▪ Standardized or centralized security controls and processes that ensure consistency across all business facilities may permit smaller sample sizes. ▪ Where the selected systems components and business facilities are not representative of the entire population, the sample size will need to be increased. ▪ The selected system components and business facilities in the sample set should be periodically rotated to confirm accurate representation of the entire population. 12 SurveyMonkey, “Sample Size Calculator” (SurveyMonkey, 1999-2018), https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/sample-size-calculator/ 13 Creative Research Systems, “Sample Size Calculator” (Creative Research Systems, 2012), https://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm 14 Qualtrics, “Calculating Sample Size” (Qualtrics, 2018), https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/calculating-sample-size/ Information Supplement • Best Practices for Maintaining PCI DSS Compliance • January 2019 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 23 ▪ If multiple standards or processes exist for a single control for different types of business facilities or system components, the sample should represent all business facilities and system components secured with each type of process. If there are no standardized processes or controls in place, each facility should be assessed individually. While sampling may be a useful tool to help an entity review and monitor their security controls, it is not permitted for an entity to apply PCI DSS requirements to only a sample of the systems or business facilities in scope for PCI DSS. 3.6.7 Maintaining Evidence Often, an organization will be required to demonstrate compliance with PCI DSS requirements to its acquirers, payment brands, or clients. While the security controls may be in place and effectively mitigate the security risk they are designed to address, the organization should implement mechanisms and processes to collect and maintain evidence to demonstrate compliance with PCI DSS. “Being compliant” is not equivalent to being able to demonstrate compliance. The process of demonstrating compliance includes the collection, storage, and protection of evidence for

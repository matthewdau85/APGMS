When Xaana looked at the available technology, we saw products that could not provide total solutions, automated methods that fell short when faced with needing to adapt quickly and an access rule that compelled enterprises to compromise on collaboration and data security in unacceptable ways. We saw a demand for an integrated AI technology that required new vision. That’s how XAANA came to be. We believe in Collaborative Intelligence (CINTEL) to move beyond machines replacing people or job automation and instead, focus on maximising the benefits of using human capabilities, rich data, and artificial intelligence. Move beyond RPA and experience the power of APA with ENIGMA2.0 where AI Process Automation meets enterprise-level applications and provides a software solution that adapts, scales, and evolves with you.

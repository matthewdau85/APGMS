standards. The scope of this program includes: 55 issuers 25 acquirers domestic and international card schemes 970,000 payment terminals 25,200 ATMs. Neither physical cards nor digital wallets are impacted directly by this change. AusPayNet is leading an industry-wide program to migrate the Australian card payments system to the AES. Australia is a leading jurisdiction in the global migration to the AES. The program is planned for completion in 2030/31, subject to any necessary regulatory approvals. For more information, you can access our AES Migration Program website page . Payments reforms AusPayNet continues to engage with regulators and Government stakeholders on the broad range of regulatory reforms affecting the payments industry, including the following consultations. RBA Review of Merchant Card Payment Costs and Surcharging In November, AusPayNet responded to the Issues Paper for the RBA's Review of Merchant Card Payment Costs and Surcharging – the first phase of the RBA's planned review of retail payments regulation. AusPayNet welcomes the RBA's commitment to regularly reviewing its regulatory settings for the payments industry to ensure that they remain fit for purpose. We recognise that any regulatory changes arising from this Review are likely to have significant and varied implications across different groups within the payments ecosystem and its end-users. In this context, our submission focused on providing insights and considerations to inform the evaluation of potential regulatory responses from an industry-wide perspective. In particular, we highlighted: The value provided by the payments ecosystem for Australia’s economy and society, and the need for any regulatory decisions to be supported by comprehensive, quantitative research that considers the distribution of both costs and benefits across the ecosystem and end-users. Member concerns about conducting a partial Review before the passage of broader reforms to the PSRA , and the importance of considering the payments ecosystem holistically, rather than making changes that would only apply to certain payments networks or participants in isolation and potentially create competitive distortions. The importance of taking a broader view of efficiency that considers not just costs, but also quality, security, innovation, and the long-term sustainability of the payments ecosystem. The risk that certain regulatory measures and increased regulatory complexity could undermine policy effectiveness through unintended behavioural responses. The value of maintaining flexibility in business and pricing models across the payments industry, to enable continued innovation and competition, and to better meet the needs of merchants. The importance of improving end-user and other stakeholders’ understanding about how the payments system operates and the value it provides. With careful consideration of these issues, we hope that the outcomes of this Review will help to further enhance - rather than inhibit - competition and efficiency in the payments ecosystem. AusPayNet looks forward to continuing its engagement with the RBA as it progresses this Review over the coming year, to ensure that the regulatory framework achieves its policy objectives while maintaining the payments system’s ability to support Australia's economic activity through secure, reliable and innovative payment services. Scams Prevention Framework In October, AusPayNet responded to Treasury’s consultation on the exposure draft legislation for establishing the Scams Prevention Framework (SPF). Our submission noted that while Members generally supported the policy intentions underlying the proposed legislative framework, there were considerable concerns that some elements of the draft legislation could have significant negative implications for competition, efficiency, innovation, and trust in the payments ecosystem. To enhance the effectiveness and minimise the potential unintended consequences of the SPF, the submission made several recommendations for refining the enabling legislation, including: Limiting the scope of consumers that regulated entities are obliged to protect under the civil penalty provisions to a more practicable range. Amending the liability regime to account for the distribution of responsibility across the scams lifecycle and limiting severe penalties to systemic breaches of the SPF sector codes. Providing greater certainty to regulated entities about the scope of their obligations, including through the SPF sector codes and regulatory guidance, and ensuring that any safe harbour provisions are sufficiently broad to cover necessary conduct under the SPF. Considering the impact of the SPF on non-bank payment service providers (PSPs). AusPayNet’s submission to the subsequent Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into the provisions of the SPF Bill 2024 built on the feedback provided in response to Treasury’s consultation on the SPF exposure draft legislation, and the initial consultation on mandatory industry scam codes in January 2024. In particular, while we welcomed the adoption of several of our recommendations on the exposure draft legislation, we noted that many of our Members’ concerns — including those highlighted above — had not been sufficiently addressed in the current Bill. While recognising that further detail on some of the obligations under the SPF would be provided in the forthcoming SPF rules and sectoral codes, we asked the Committee to consider further refinements to the overarching legislation to enhance the effectiveness and minimise the potential unintended consequences of the Framework. The Committee released its inquiry report on 3 February, recommending that the Senate pass the Bill. The report included two recommendations from the Coalition of particular interest to the payments industry: that the Government provide a clear roadmap for the inclusion of other regulated sectors, including non-bank PSPs and digital assets businesses; and that, to do so, the Government urgently progress new licensing frameworks for those sectors. The Bill was subsequently passed by the House of Representatives on 6 February, and by the Senate on 13 February. We look

and networks have been identified, all applicable PCI DSS requirements for those systems and networks must be evaluated. For example, any new system added to the CDE would need to be configured in accordance with defined system- configuration standards⎯including password-complexity settings, access-control configurations, Information Supplement • Best Practices for Maintaining PCI DSS Compliance • January 2019 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

The new system would also need to be included in quarterly vulnerability scanning schedules and integrated into other security and monitoring processes such as centralized logging, file-integrity monitoring, antivirus, etc. 3.10.4 End of Life Technology Reviews Organizations should also periodically review the technologies supporting the CDE to confirm that they continue to support the security needs of the organization (see Appendix D: PCI DSS Compliance Program Activities,” for recommended activities to maintain compliance). As IT solutions or implementations reach end of life (EOL), some vendors may choose to end support for those technologies before the organization is prepared to decommission them. Unsupported technologies may require an organization to implement Compensating Controls to mitigate the risk and meet the intent of affected PCI DSS requirements until a remediation plan, up to and including replacement of the technology, can be implemented. As an example, organizations relying on the use of unsupported operating systems (OS) to run systems and applications within the CDE will need to consider how to ensure those systems remain secure once the OS vendor has stopped issuing security patches. One option may be to purchase extended support from the vendor or one of its partners. Other options may include upgrading operating systems and/or replacing applications dependent on outdated operating systems with updated versions. Regardless of the approach, organizations need to carefully evaluate the impact that an aging technology solution has on the security of the CDE. Compliance managers should also consider additional and/or compensating controls, and exercise extra rigor in security-review processes to ensure adequate security and oversight until replacement technologies can be implemented. Any resulting remediation strategies should have clearly defined goals and timelines.

Organizations accustomed to a point-in-time approach to PCI DSS compliance that focuses primarily on annual validation may find it difficult to foster security across their people, processes, and technology as needed to support sustained compliance. Executive sponsorship is critical for organizations to be successful in implementing ongoing PCI DSS compliance programs. PCI DSS Requirement 12.4.1 for service providers became effective on February 1, 2018. This requirement relates directly to executive management accountability to ensure responsibility for maintaining a PCI DSS Compliance Program is assigned. Additionally, a charter for the PCI DSS compliance program is required, to include a communication structure that ensures executive management is accountable for and aware of any compliance-impacting risks on an ongoing basis. Although PCI DSS Requirement 12.4.1 is intended only for service providers, it is also useful as a guideline for other entities to include as part of a continuous improvement model. Organizations that focus solely on compliance can be compared to people who go on a crash diet.21 It may work temporarily and make people appear healthier, but it is not sustainable over the long term and does not reflect an overall commitment to a healthier lifestyle. To improve one’s overall long-term health, healthier activities—such as ongoing exercise and nutrition—need to be incorporated into one’s daily life. The same concepts hold true for compliance-focused organizations. A Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) or Report on Compliance (ROC) may demonstrate that the organization is compliant at a given point in time, but does not necessarily reflect an overall commitment to security. For organizations to truly become secure, they must first make a commitment to doing so, including: ▪ Combining security goals with other key business goals; ▪ Articulating security goals using the same terms as other business goals; ▪ Assigning responsibility for ensuring the achievement of their security goals and holding those with responsibility accountable (see Appendix B: Common Assessment Roles & Responsibilities”); ▪ Developing tools, techniques, and metrics for tracking the performance and sustainability of security activities (see Appendix D: ); and ▪ Evolving security goals and practices as other business goals and risks evolve. Organizations that follow these basic principles and best practices are not only illustrating a higher level of due diligence in the protection of cardholder data; they are also helping to ensure the long- term viability of payment cards as a safe and secure means for conducting payment transactions. 21 NetIQ Paper “Sustainable Compliance: How to Align Compliance, Security, and Business Goals” (NetIQ, 2012).

INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background 1.1.1 In 2009 the RBA together with industry participants agreed to reform the Australian ATM system. The reforms included three measures: (a) an Access Code to facilitate access to the ATM system; (b) facilitation of direct charging for the use of ATMs; and (c) the setting of the bilateral interchange fees paid between ATM Issuers and ATM Acquirers in respect of ATM transactions to zero (subject to certain exceptions). 1.1.2 To implement these reforms, the RBA introduced the ATM Access Regime and ATM Access Australia Limited (AAAL) developed the ATM Access Code. 1.1.3 On 3 December 2024, AAAL resolved to de-register AAAL as a company following the replacement of the ATM Access Code with a new subscription-based Access Standard administered by AusPayNet. 1.1.4 This Access Standard is intended to supercede the ATM Access Code. Accordingly: (a) this Access Standard takes effect in accordance with clause 1.14.1; (b) the parties to a Connection Agreement executed under the ATM Access Code agree that references to the ATM Access Code in the Connection Agreement shall be taken to be to this Access Standard, unless the context requires otherwise. 1.2 Operation of the Access Standard 1.2.1 The Access Standard is divided into the following parts: (a) Part A relates to preliminary matters such as the scope of the Access Standard, subscribing to the Standard, its objectives, administration and fees; (b) Part B relates to the obligation to provide access, outlines the eligibility requirements for seeking access and the process which an Access Seeker must follow to apply for access to the ATM system and enter a Connection Agreement with an Access Provider, the implementation process once a Connection Agreement has been signed and payment obligations for access (see also Schedule 1, Schedule 2, Schedule 3, Schedule 5 and Schedule 6); ATM Access Standard Part A - Preliminary Introduction AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS NETWORK 7 (c) Part C relates to Subscribers engaging in ATM Interchange Activities with each other, including rules in relation to Direct Charging (see also Schedule 4); and (d) Part D relates to administration of the Access Standard, including dispute resolution, reporting, confidentiality and liability. 1.2.2 Key roles and terms under the Access Standard are summarised in the following table. Role Description Roles relevant to the provision of ATM services to Cardholders ATM Acquirer Operates ATMs, in which ATM Cards may be used to access funds from an account held by the ATM Cardholder with an ATM Issuer. An ATM Acquirer may operate its own ATMs and/or may operate ATMs owned by a third party. An ATM Acquirer may also be an ATM Issuer. ATM Issuer Issues ATM Cards and PINs to its customers, for use in ATMs operated by the ATM Issuer or any other ATM Acquirer. An ATM Issuer may also be an ATM Acquirer. Roles relevant to the granting of access rights Access Seeker The party that seeks to exercise the access rights granted by the Access Standard. An Access Seeker must be or become a Subscriber. Access Provider A Subscriber with whom an Access Seeker wishes to establish a Direct Connection or Direct Clearing/Settlement Arrangement. Options for connection Direct Connection A direct communications link between two parties via distinct IPSec protected Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections to the COIN that enables them to directly exchange ATM Transaction messages: • in respect of their own activities as an ATM Issuer or ATM Acquirer; and/or • on behalf of ATM Issuers and/or ATM Acquirers, to facilitate the Clearing and Settlement of ATM Transactions. (Using a) Switch If a party wants to exchange ATM Transaction messages with another party with whom it does NOT have a Direct Connection, then it must use the services of a Switch. Options for clearing and settling ATM Transactions Direct Connection A direct communications link between two parties via distinct IPSec protected Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections to the COIN that enables them to directly exchange ATM Transaction messages, to facilitate Clearing and Settlement of ATM Transactions that arise between them or between parties on whose behalf they Clear and Settle ATM Transactions.

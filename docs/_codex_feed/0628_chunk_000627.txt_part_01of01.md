Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (d) Documented procedures exist to ensure that keys are not installed in any SCD where suspicious alteration of an SCD has been detected until the SCD has been inspected and a reasonable degree of assurance has been reached that the SCD has not been subject to any unauthorised physical or logical modifications.82 Reference ISO 13491-2, requirement A48; PCI PIN SR 29. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (e) Documented, auditable, key management procedures exist and are followed for the secure management of any Acquirer controlled key used in the authentication processes associated with Terminal software authentication.83 Reference Code Set Vol 3, clause 3.2.5(a); PCI PIN SR 29. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (f) If the SCD can translate a PIN from one PIN block format to another or if the SCD verifies PINs, then procedures exist, and are followed, to prevent or detect, repeated unauthorised calls resulting in the exhaustive determination of PINs.84 82 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 83 Last amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 84 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 1 - INTRODUCTION AND MEMBER OBLIGATIONS ANNEXURE A ANNUAL SECURITY AUDITS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 31 Reference ISO 13491-2, requirement C5. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason A.2.3 General Key Management (a) Documented procedures exist, and are followed to control keys so that they exist in only one or more of the permissible forms:85 In a SCD; Encrypted under a DEA 2, AES or DEA 3 key; Managed as two or more full length components using the principles of dual control and split knowledge; or Managed as m of n key shares under a Secret Sharing Scheme. Reference ISO 11568, clauses 4.1.3; PCI PIN SR 8-1. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (b) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure a person entrusted with a key component reasonably protects that component such that no person (not similarly entrusted with that component) can observe or otherwise obtain that component.86 Reference ISO 11568, clauses 4.1.2; PCI PIN SR 8-2. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (c) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure keys and key components are generated using a random or pseudo-random process 85 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 86 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 1 - INTRODUCTION AND MEMBER OBLIGATIONS ANNEXURE A ANNUAL SECURITY AUDITS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 32 such that it is not possible to determine that some keys are more probable than other keys from the set of all possible keys.87 Reference ISO 11568, clauses 4.6.1.1; PCI PIN SR 5-1. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (d) Documented procedures exist to ensure each of the following:88 A key is changed if its compromise is known or suspected; Keys encrypted under or derived from a compromised key are changed; Key is not changed to a variant or a transformation of the compromised key; and The amount of time in which the compromised key remains active is consistent with the risk to all affected parties. Reference ISO 11568, clauses 4.17; PCI PIN SR 22-1. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (e) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure a key is used for only a single designated purpose.89 Reference ISO 11568, clause 4.1.7; PCI PIN SR 19. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason 87 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 88 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 89 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 1 - INTRODUCTION AND MEMBER OBLIGATIONS ANNEXURE A ANNUAL SECURITY AUDITS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 33 (f) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure that when a key is installed under dual control using key components that these key components are only combined within a SCD.90 Reference ISO 11568, clause 4.10.2; PCI PIN SR 12-4. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (g) Key components are combined to form a key by a process such that no active bit of the key could be determined without knowledge of all components. Key components are combined using one of the following functions:91 Key shares are combined to form a key by a process such that no active bit of the key could be determined without knowledge of m of n key shares. Reference ISO 11568, clause 4.1.2; PCI PIN SR 12-4. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (h) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure when in secure transit, cleartext key components are protected from compromise in one of the following manners:92 Key components are transported in separate tamper-evident packaging; and/or Key components are transported in an Approved Device. Reference ISO 11568, clause 4.1.2; PCI PIN SR 12-4. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason 90 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 91 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 92 Last amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 IAC

Depending on the nature of the payment card environment(s), not all the requirements and/or activities below will apply to an entity. The intent of this appendix is to aid organizations in developing a baseline to track PCI DSS compliance activities that must be validated at defined intervals. The ID can not only be used as a reference in review meetings, but it may also be a reference into an ISMS (Information Security Management Solution) or other repositories such as SharePoint, where the evidence of completion of the activity is located. The “Title” column is generic and can be amended to be more meaningful to the organization⎯for example, to include product names. An effective way to manage the activities is to allocate each activity an “Owner” (see 3.4, “Assign Ownership for Coordinating Security Activities,” for further information) and then periodically (see 3.6.5, “Review Frequency,” for additional information). As part of the health-check meetings, every activity should be reviewed with the owners and a commentary included where applicable. The “Comment” column can be used to capture references (e.g., file names, documents, individuals, etc.) to evidence provided during the periodic health-check meetings as well as include a status update or a description of a risk, issue, or action. The “Status” column can serve as a traffic-light system (e.g., red, yellow, and green). Even those activities that may be distant should be reviewed, albeit quickly, as planning may need to be initiated months in advance of the due date⎯e.g., scheduling annual penetration testing. Note: Some of the activities listed have no specific PCI DSS timeframe⎯the frequency for these is the suggested review period. It is advised that some activities are carried out and reviewed more frequently than the PCI DSS requirement, as a failure of a key activity may not be recoverable in terms of evidence collection.

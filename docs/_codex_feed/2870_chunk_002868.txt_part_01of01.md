Risk Assessment Enterprise-wide process that identifies valuable system resources and threats; quantifies loss exposures (that is, loss potential) based on estimated frequencies and costs of occurrence; and (optionally) recommends how to allocate resources to countermeasures to minimize total exposure. See Targeted Risk Analysis. Risk Ranking Process of classifying risks to identify, prioritize, and address items in the order of importance. ROC Acronym for “Report on Compliance.” Reporting tool used to document detailed results from an entity’s PCI DSS assessment. RRG Acronym for “Roadmap Roundtable Group.” RSA Algorithm for public-key encryption. See Strong Cryptography. s SAQ Acronym for “Self-Assessment Questionnaire.” Reporting tool used to document self-assessment results from an entity’s PCI DSS assessment. Scoping Process of identifying all system components, people, and processes to be included in a PCI DSS assessment. See PCI DSS section: 4 Scope of PCI DSS Requirements . Secure Coding The process of creating and implementing applications that are resistant to tampering and/or compromise. Security Event An occurrence considered by an organization to have potential security implications to a system or its environment. In the context of PCI DSS, security events identify suspicious or anomalous activity. Security Officer Primary responsible person for an entity’s security-related affairs. Segmentation Also referred to as “network segmentation” or “isolation.” Segmentation isolates system components that store, process, or transmit cardholder data from systems that do not. See “Segmentation” in PCI DSS section: 4 Scope of PCI DSS Requirements . Sensitive Area A sensitive area is typically a subset of the CDE and is any area that houses systems considered critical to the CDE. This includes data centers, server rooms, back-office rooms at retail locations, and any area that concentrates or aggregates cardholder data storage, processing, or transmission. Sensitive areas also include areas housing systems that manage or maintain the security of the CDE (for example, those providing network security controls or that manage physical or logical security). This excludes the areas where only point-of-sale terminals are present, such as the cashier areas in a retail store or call centers where agents are taking payments. Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD) Security-related information used to authenticate cardholders and/or authorize payment card transactions. This information includes, but is not limited to, card verification codes, full track data (from magnetic stripe or equivalent on a chip), PINs, and PIN blocks. Separation of Duties Practice of dividing steps in a function among multiple individuals, to prevent a single individual from subverting the process. Service Code Three-digit or four-digit value in the magnetic-stripe that follows the expiration date of the payment card on the track data. It is used for various things, such as defining service attributes, differentiating between international and national interchange, or identifying usage restrictions. Service Provider Business entity that is not a payment brand, directly involved in the processing, storage, or transmission of cardholder data (CHD) and/or sensitive authentication data (SAD) on behalf of another entity. This includes payment gateways, payment service providers (PSPs), and independent sales organizations (ISOs). This also includes companies that provide services that control or could impact the security of CHD and/or SAD. Examples include managed service providers that provide managed firewalls, IDS, and other services as well as hosting providers and other entities. If an entity provides a service that involves only the provision of public network access—such as a telecommunications company providing just the communication link—the entity would not be considered a service provider for that service (although they may be considered a service provider for other services). See Multi-Tenant Service Provider and Third-Party Service Provider. SNMP Acronym for “Simple Network Management Protocol.”. Split knowledge A method by which two or more entities separately have key components or key shares that individually convey no knowledge of the resultant cryptographic key. SQL Acronym for “Structured Query Language.” SSH Abbreviation for “Secure Shell.” SSL Acronym for “Secure Sockets Layer.” Strong Cryptography Cryptography is a method to protect data through a reversible encryption process, and is a foundational primitive used in many security protocols and services. Strong cryptography is based on industry-tested and accepted algorithms along with key lengths that provide a minimum of 112-bits of effective key strength and proper key-management practices . Effective key strength can be shorter than the actual ‘bit’ length of the key, which can lead to algorithms with larger keys providing lesser protection than algorithms with smaller actual, but larger effective, key sizes. It is recommended that all new implementations use a minimum of 128-bits of effective key strength. Examples of industry references on cryptographic algorithms and key lengths include: NIST Special Publication 800-57 Part 1, BSI TR-02102-1, ECRYPT-CSA D5.4 Algorithms, Key Size and Protocols Report (2018), and ISO/IEC 18033 Encryption algorithms, and ISO/IEC 14888-3:2-81 IT Security techniques – Digital signatures with appendix – Part 3: Discrete logarithm based mechanisms . System Components Any network devices, servers, computing devices, virtual components, or software included in or connected to the CDE, or that could impact the security of cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data. System-level object Anything on a system component that is required for its operation, including but not limited to application executables and configuration files, system configuration files, static and shared libraries and DLLs, system executables, device drivers and device configuration files, and third-party components. t TAB Acronym for “Technical Advisory Board.” Targeted Risk Analysis For PCI DSS purposes, a risk analysis that focuses on a specific PCI DSS requirement(s) of interest, either because the requirement allows flexibility

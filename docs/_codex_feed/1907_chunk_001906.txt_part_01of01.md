Do you need someone to pay you, but not keen on touching cash at the moment? With PayID you can stay COVID safe while receiving an instant payment from a friend, family member or customer. It’s just like making a cash payment, but without the notes and coins! The money moves instantly from the payer’s account, straight into your account – all within seconds. And the best thing about PayID is you don’t need to remember your BSB and account number. Instead, you can use something easier to remember like your phone number or email address. To create a PayID and link itto your bank account, log in to your banking app. Find or search for PayID in the menu and follow the prompts to create and link a PayID to your account. Then, when someone needs to pay you, give them your PayID instead of your BSB and account number. If the person paying you isn’t sure how to use your PayID, tell them they use it the same way they would use a BSB and account number to make a payment inside their usual banking app. For more information, contact your bank.

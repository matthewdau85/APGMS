CDR. PayTo supports third party payment initiation in a safe and secure manner requiring only one access point, and a range of either indirect or direct access options, including streamlined options for organisations with CDR accreditation. API capabilities APIs will play an important role in supporting third parties wanting to use the PayTo service. APIs can help create seamless, digital processes, and a better end-to-end customer experience. NPP Australia does not host an NPP API service nor offer NPP APIs for third party use on the platform. Participating financial institutions can choose to make their proprietary NPP APIs available for use by third parties. It is anticipated that a number of these will offer APIs to support their PayTo services. For more information on what API services will be made available, organisations should contact their financial institution. Third parties can access the cloud-based NPP Australia Developer Portal where they can build and test their NPP-based prototypes and solutions, using the NPP API Framework and sample RESTful APIs in JSON format4. This Developer Portal includes sample APIs that support key PayTo functions, enabling third parties to test these APIs in an independent sandbox environment. 2 See https://treasury.gov.au/review/future-directions-consumer-data-right/final-report 3 See https://www.nppa.com.au/the-platform/api-framework-and-sandbox 4 The NPP Australia Developer Portal is available here 16 | PayTo Service Overview v2.0 17 | PayTo Service Overview v2.0 PayTo Delivery The delivery of the PayTo service is a key priority for NPP Australia and the industry. Implementing this critical capability is a multi-year programme of work requiring significant change to participating organisations’ existing back-office processes, technical systems and customer facing digital channels. NPP participating organisations are required to support their payer customers being able to authorise new PayTo agreements and process any payments associated with those agreements. NPP participating organisations will decide what payment initiation services they want to make available to their business customers and the market more broadly according to their individual business priorities and timing. Organisations interested in understanding how to best utilise the PayTo service should consult with their financial institution or payments provider to understand their specific service offerings and timing. PayTo Use Cases The following use cases illustrate how PayTo can be used by third parties to initiate authorised payments from a payer customer’s bank account. Cameron wants to pay his monthly phone bill with Teleco directly from his bank account. Cameron goes to Teleco’s website and provides his details to Teleco to set up his monthly payments. Teleco who is a PayTo User requests its bank to create a PayTo agreement for Cameron in the MMS. Teleco’s bank creates a PayTo agreement in the Mandate Management Service (MMS). The MMS sends a notification back to Teleco’s bank to say the PayTo agreement has been authorised. Teleco’s bank may provide a notification back to Teleco. Cameron’s Bank gets a notification from the MMS that a new PayTo agreement has been created and needs to be authorised by Cameron. Cameron gets a request in his banking app to authorise the PayTo agreement for Teleco, which he does. Cameron’s bank confirms authorisation of the PayTo agreement to the MMS. Cameron’s monthly phone bill is now due Teleco instructs its bank to send a payment initiation request for payment of Cameron’s monthly phone bill. Teleco’s bank makes an API call to the MMS to validate the PayTo agreement record and that the payment initiation request is within the terms of the PayTo agreement. Validation is successful and Teleco’s bank sends the payment initiation request to Cameron’s bank. Cameron’s bank receives the payment initiation request, validates it and responds in real-time to Teleco’s bank accepting the payment request. Cameron’s bank sends an NPP credit transfer in real-time to Teleco’s account at Teleco’s bank for Cameron’s phone bill. Cameron can see in his banking app that his monthly phone bill has been paid. Teleco receives confirmation that Cameron’s monthly phone bill has been paid.

She provides her banking details to be able to fund her purchases from her bank account. PayLater requests its payment service provider, Fast Payments, who is an NPP Connected Institution, to create a PayTo agreement for Lily in the MMS. Fast Payments creates a PayTo agreement in the Mandate Management Service (MMS) for Lily. The MMS sends a notification back to Fast Payments to say the PayTo agreement has been authorised. Fast Payments may provide a notification back to PayLater. Lily’s bank gets a notification from the MMS that a new PayTo agreement has been created and needs to be authorised by Lily. Lily, who is still in PayLater’s app, receives a notification to open her banking app to authorise the PayTo agreement for PayLater, which she does.

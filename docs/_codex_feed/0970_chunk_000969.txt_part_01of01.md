what Andrew was just speaking about in terms of MFA and phishing-resistant authentication and, you know, it's a triangle and a square and it's one thing, and the same. And there are cases where, you know, requirements might necessitate multiple factors. And then there are cases where phishing resistance is just needed regardless of factors. And there still could be factors involved, but the phishing resistance is the key part of that. And I think sometimes, to answer your question, terminology sometimes can be a little bit, can be tricky, right, when it comes to these kinds of things. But it's pretty simple actually. A synced passkey is a passkey that you can access across devices through a secure credential manager, like you mentioned before, there's password managers out there. That’s what historically we would call them, but it could be like the iCloud keychain, Google passwords, One Password, Dash Lane, or all secure credential managers by which you could access your passkey across your devices. A device-bound passkey is a pretty on-the-nose name because the passkey is bound to a particular device, which could be a hardware security key, for example, or another form, like external form factor piece of hardware. It could actually be an app on a phone as well. But what that means is you have your passkey bound to that device. You can actually use that device to sign into other devices, but the passkey doesn't actually leave that device. Alicia Malone: Okay, that helps a lot to clarify. Alicia Malone: So, Megan, what is the process for companies to begin using passkeys for sign in instead of passwords? And how do you roll out passkey adoption? Megan Shamas: Thank you. That's a really good question. So, the good news - so earlier when I mentioned that passwords are built into the fabric of the internet - the good news is that passkey support is now built into almost everything at this point. We really wanted to replicate the availability and ubiquity of passwords with passkeys. So, today, support for passkeys is built into every operating system and browser. Most IDPs support passkeys. We also have a strong vendor ecosystem with certified products that can help support implementation. Most organizations have a path forward, technically, to move forward with passkeys. I think what we see for the most part with implementations is that number one - I'm glad I'm on a PCI podcast right now - is that there's planning and ensuring that you're meeting compliance and requirements for your organization that require some pre-planning. So, to Andrew's point, you have passkeys and different types of passkeys. There might be scenarios where you need to support additional types of authentication. You want to ensure that you're meeting all the requirements that you have for your different user types. And then you have a path forward and a roadmap forward for that. And I think the other piece that needs to be planned, pre-planned, is a very important aspect of supporting passkeys is really just change management, and education, and ensuring that your users, whether they're, you know, consumer end users or from a workforce perspective, your employees have advanced notice of what's changing, what they can expect, have some training on that, and really can expect what's going to happen. Passkeys are very easy to use, but we do find that the more pre-planning and the more education that is put forward, the less likely it is that there's really any issue when it's time to start actually using passkeys. So, technically, the path is there. The organizations have to think about their business requirements, their organizational requirements, their compliance requirements, and just have a solid plan to move forward. Alicia Malone: So, now, I have a question for both of you. How close are we to a future where account takeover is no longer a threat? And Megan, let's start with you. Megan Shamas: Well, thank you. I hope closer. I think we have a ways to go here, but I think we're on the right path. I think one of the things that's really important is that organizations that set requirements like PCI - there's other organizations, of course, that put forward guidance such as NIST - are recognizing the importance of phishing resistance, and educating folks about that, and helping them to understand why phishing-resistant authentication is important, and what security issues phishing-resistant authentication solves. So, I think that is a big part of getting us to a point where folks are getting on board with phishing-resistant authentication. They're starting to leverage it. They understand the benefits. So, I think we're on a really great path and I really applaud these organizations, like PCI, for really stepping forward to show the difference and educate on that. But, I think what we need to do after that is, and it's going to take some time, but we have to then start removing some of the phishable authentication methods that folks are using. So increase the use of passkeys, start removing passwords and other types of phishable authentication methods from being like the backup for criminals to go after, right? Once we can get rid of that, we're going to be at a place where we're going to be in a lot better of a spot, but we're certainly on a great path forward. Alicia Malone:

service provider is used by the entity to process payments, it is important to review how the service is implemented as it can impact the PCI DSS scope. In the following examples, the entity uses a service provider that will capture the cardholder data via an IVR system or DTMF capture, or any other technology, and process the payment on behalf of the entity. All the data the entity should receive is a truncated version of the PAN or a tokenized PAN with the transaction data and an acknowledgement of the transaction result. The service provider location and the account data flow must be understood. These examples are provided to highlight that SIP redirection does not necessarily completely remove the entity’s infrastructure from PCI DSS scope. In the Diagram F1 below, the service provider is situated close to the carrier network and the account data will be “intercepted” before it reaches the entity’s infrastructure rather than being redirected from it. This redirection should not have any impact on the entity’s infrastructure scope for PCI DSS.

If a service provider supplies a device onsite, upstream of an SBC or other telephony infrastructure, to redirect or re-invite the call away to carrier network service, this device is in scope for PCI DSS requirements. If this device were compromised, a simple carrier preselect (CPS) or least-cost routing (LCR) alteration could re-route telephony through to a snooping service prior to delivery to the carrier IVR or DTMF capture service.

The devices, premises, and networks connected to the redirection device may therefore be in scope for PCI DSS requirements. The entity and assessor should refer to the section, “Scope of PCI DSS Requirements,” of PCI DSS and the Information Supplement, Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation, to evaluate the scope for PCI DSS. In assessing the device, the aspects to be considered may include (but are not limited to): access control (local or remote), configuration/hardening, patching, change management, security testing, physical security, logging/monitoring, service-provider management. When payment card data is redirected to a service provider over a public network, whatever the format (voice, video, picture), it is in scope for applicable PCI DSS controls as the transmission is initiated by the entityor, by delegation, the service provider. The payment card data must be protected by strong encryption. This can be done by encrypting the data itself or by using a secure connection via, for example, the use of a VPN or a secure protocole.g., SRTP, knowing that encryption using such a protocol is difficult across several telephone operators.

Diagram F3 shows a scenario where the payment details are taken over POTS or VoIP and processed through a payment terminal connected to a payment processor via IP. The payment terminal and the connection to the payment processor would be in scope for PCI DSS.

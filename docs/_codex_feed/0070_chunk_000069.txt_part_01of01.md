MEDIA RELEASE 21 March 2025 AusPayNet launches e-Conveyancing Payments Industry Code Australian Payments Network (AusPayNet), Australia’s self-regulatory body for the payments industry, today announced the launch of the e-Conveyancing Payments Industry Code (‘Industry Code’), with membership now open to industry participants. The launch is a significant milestone in regulating financial settlement in e-Conveyancing and enhancing security, standardisation and efficiency in e-conveyancing payments. The Industry Code has been developed through close collaboration between AusPayNet, the e-Conveyancing industry, financial institutions and other stakeholders. The Industry Code specifies security-related compliance obligations, standardises elements of the process for settling e-Conveyancing payments and establishes a process for managing mistaken or incomplete payments between Industry Code participants. It will apply to e-Conveyancing transactions by single Electronic Lodgment Network Operators (ELNO) and to interoperable (multiple ELNO transactions) when these become available. AusPayNet’s Chief Executive Officer, Andy White, said: “With e-Conveyancing increasingly the norm in property transactions across Australia, this Industry Code is an important step toward ensuring a secure and standardised approach to e-Conveyancing payments. “It is the result of a collaborative process that meets the needs of the various stakeholders involved and will support the growth and evolution of e-Conveyancing in Australia.” Enquiries and applications for membership of the Industry Code should be directed to AusPayNet . Members will have the opportunity to participate in the Management Committee responsible for overseeing the administration and ongoing development of the Industry Code. The Industry Code Regulations and Operating Procedures will be published, and the Industry Code will be effective, once reviewed by the Management Committee.

055 136 519] 36 including customer identification and verification, authentication of transactions and management of token generation and Card data security. These Guidelines are not intended to address the issues of liability apportionment between Cardholders, Card Issuers, Digital Wallet Providers and other parties to a Third Party Digital Wallet transaction: this is a proprietary matter for parties to resolve. The Guidelines do not apply to software applications that process payments solely using card-on-file data provided directly by a Cardholder to the payment service provider, where ‘card-not-present’ liability arrangements apply. The Guidelines have not been drafted to apply to Card Issuers’ proprietary mobile banking applications or proprietary wallet services, being those provided by a Card Issuer solely for its own customers. The responsibility for managing fraud and security of proprietary wallet services, and the liability for, and reputational risk associated with, losses resulting from use of proprietary products, rests entirely with the Card Issuer. A Card Issuer may choose to apply aspects of these Guidelines to its proprietary mobile banking applications and wallet services where appropriate. D.1.3 OBJECTIVES (a) The purpose of the Guidelines is to assist Card Issuers with establishing their respective security and data privacy requirements for Third Party Digital Wallets to promote the integrity and security of these services. (b) The Guidelines are voluntary and are intended to represent industry best practice for security and tokenisation of mobile payment transactions and for privacy and limited permitted disclosure of Cardholder and mobile payments data. (c) The Guidelines are not intended to, and do not, of themselves: (i) presume, affect or prescribe the terms of any arrangement established by any Card Issuer with any Digital Wallet Provider/s; (ii) affect the rights of any Card Scheme administrator to establish scheme rules for provisioning its co-branded Cards to Digital Wallets or the obligations of any Card Issuer under those rules; (iii) affect the right of any Card Issuer to exercise commercial freedom in the selection of mobile payments services processors and partners; (iv) affect the obligations of any Card Issuer as a subscriber to the ePayments Code or to its Cardholders more generally; or (v) affect the right of any Card Issuer to determine to apply different requirements and standards to those set out in the Guidelines. (d) The Guidelines are technology neutral and are not to be construed as promoting, endorsing or impeding any particular service provider/s. IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS REQUIREMENTS ANNEXURE C DEBIT CARD FRAUD PREVENTION GUIDELINES Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 37 (e) Card Issuers are encouraged to promote awareness of the Guidelines amongst Digital Wallet Providers, Card Scheme administrators, and other participants in the provision of Digital Wallet services. (f) Card Issuers are encouraged to ensure that the provisioning of Cards to a Third Party Digital Wallet does not affect or derogate from the intrinsic capabilities and functions of Cards, or any priority network arrangement that applies to them. (g) AusPayNet does not monitor or enforce any Card Issuer’s adoption or use of, or compliance with, these Guidelines. (h) AusPayNet will periodically review these Guidelines to ensure they remain effective and relevant, particularly as international standards for mobile payments develop, and may amend them from time to time.

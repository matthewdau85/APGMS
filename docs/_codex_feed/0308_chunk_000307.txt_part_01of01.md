Ink Coverage Amended, effective 19/05/08 Care is to be taken that the background security design provides sufficient visible ink coverage to afford protection against attack. To achieve this, the following principles need to be observed ;  For security reasons, it is preferred a fugitive colour other than the foreground colour printing be used; i.e. more than a single colour is printed on the front of the cheque The security background design should allow sufficient ink coverage to protect the document from attack. (see example below)  Background Colours: for ease of recognition the cheque background is best printed using one or more pastel shaded spot colours. Each colour needs to exhibit the highest degree of fugitivity/sensitivity to chemical attack and difficulty to replicate or colour copy. To ensure the printed product affords the best in image friendliness as well as in document security the spot colours shall not exceed the maximum requirement for scan non-readable PCS values when printed as a solid at normal ink film weights. 6.5 Permanence of Machine Printed In-fill Inserted, effective 22/03/2006 The areas in a cheque or deposit form that are “in-filled” with, for example, the amount, payee (in the case of a cheque) or the account that is to be credited (in the case of a deposit form) are known as in-fill.

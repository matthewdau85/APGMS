Detailed information on each of the security control requirements is provided on this page. If you require additional information or assistance, you can visit the DSP hub or contact the Digital Partnership Office (DPO) via the DSP service desk in Online services for DSPs . On this page Annual reviews You must provide annual assurance that your products and services remain compliant with the controls and requirements of the DSP OSF. We will raise an OSF annual review ticket via the DSP service desk and email you instructions on the actions you should take for your annual review. The annual review includes a review of your self-assessment or independent certification currency. A self-assessment is deemed current for 2 years from the date of our initial approval. The validity of the independent certification currency is determined by the expiry date listed on the certificate. Audit logging Audit logging seeks to ensure traceability of access and actions within software which can be used for detection of anomalies or to support the investigation of a security incident. In the event of a security incident, you will need to supply us with relevant audit logs. Audit logging needs to include: access and event-based logs including changes to privileges, permissions, and authorisations users with privileged access must also be identifiable within these logs shared login credentials are not permitted, and each individual user and session will need to be uniquely identifiable through audit logs logs must be kept for a minimum of 12 months and must not be deleted within this period. Evidence required DSPs must provide dummy or authentic access and event logs (sensitive information redacted) which include: authentication and authorisation date and time of the event username / identifier success or failure of the event event description ICT equipment location and identification. You can provide an audit log policy to cover the inclusions requested (such as retention and no shared logins). It is recommended you adopt a risk-based approach to implement controls from the Australian Cyber Security Centre Guidelines-System-Monitoring or equivalent industry standard such as NIST Guide to Computer Security Log Management . Authentication Multi-Factor Authentication Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is defined as a method of authentication that uses two or more authentication factors from different categories, to authenticate a single claimant to a single authentication verifier. The authentication factors can be categorised as something you: know - such as a password or a response to a security question have - such as a one-time pin, SMS message, smartcard, or software certificate are - such as biometric data, like a fingerprint or facial geometry. Single-factor authentication generally falls into the ‘something you know’ category such as a password. MFA requires a user to prove they have physical access to a second factor that they have (such as a physical token) or are (such as fingerprint. MFA for DSP controlled environments This requirement seeks to minimise the opportunity for unauthorised users to access Taxation, Accounting, Payroll, Business Registry or Superannuation related information. Under this security control requirement: MFA must be permanent and cannot be disabled by the client. MFA is required for all users of software products that are controlled or hosted by the DSP (for accessing information for themselves or other entities or individuals). all cloud environments must have MFA in place to access any data in scope of the DSP OSF MFA is required for all DSP staff with privileged user access inactive session time-out occurs after a maximum 30 minutes (15 minutes is preferred). This is a screen lock process where full MFA is not required to unlock. remember me on this device must be limited to 24 hours brute force lockouts are applied after a maximum of 5 unsuccessful login attempts. This specifies that an event must occur, not how each DSP handles this lockout before a client can re-try logon. We do not seek the details of the lockout process, only that it occurs. shared logins are not permitted and need to be blocked by the DSP. Each individual user and session will need to be uniquely identifiable through audit logs authenticator apps can be used such as Microsoft Authenticator, Symantec VIP or Google Authenticator, and will need to demonstrate how MFA is enforced at login social media credentials are not recommended to be used for MFA to sign in. However if your solution is based on the use of social media credentials you must contact the DPO to discuss your proposed solution. Further information on each MFA method can be found at ACSC: Implementing Multi Factor Authentication . If you have not implemented MFA, you should consider implementing passphrase management, account lockout and resetting passphrase practices described in the Australian Government Guidelines for system hardening . Single sign on DSPs must seek advice from the DPO on the use of enterprise Single Sign On (SSO) to support their clients. When implementing enterprise SSO, you must ensure that: disablement of MFA is controlled by the DSP, not the client encryption in transit between the client’s system and software uses an approved protocol as per the Australian Government Guidelines for using cryptography remember me on this device is limited to 24 hours SSO tokens is limited to a maximum period of 24 hours tokens or temporary credentials are isolated to an individual device and expire once used - tokens or temporary credentials must expire within 24 hours brute force lockouts are applied after

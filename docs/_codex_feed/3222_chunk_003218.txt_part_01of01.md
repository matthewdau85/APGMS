PCI Security Standards Council Bulletin: Secure Software v1.2 ROV and AOV Published 14 April 2023 The PCI Security Standards Council has published the Report on Validation (ROV) template and Attestation of Validation (AOV) for the Secure Software Standard v1.2. The ROV and AOV are validation tools to assist Secure Software Assessors and Payment Software Vendors in the performance and reporting of Secure Software Assessments. The ROV and AOV for version 1.1 will be supported through 31 August 2023. As of 01 September 2023, all new Secure Software submissions must be completed using version 1.2 of the Secure Software Standard, Program Guide, Report on Validation (ROV) template, and Attestation of Validation (AOV). Assessors will have an additional 90 days (until 29 November 2023) to complete all v1.1 submissions that are ‘In Process’ (i.e., those submitted, and fees paid to PCI SSC prior to 01 September 2023). Both documents are now available in the Document Library on the PCI SSC website. ###

Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 28 AusPayNet September 2017 2.2.10.2 Machine-Printed Cheques Where the Amount in Figures is machine or computer printed, a field guide or drop-out rectangle is not required provided the background is printed as scan non-readable. However, if a field guide or dropout rectangle is used, conformance to the specification at Section 2.2.11 must be observed. The $-sign may be machine printed at the same time as the Amount in Figures and both must be positioned in the area defined at Section 2.2.9.1. When the $-sign is pre-printed, it must be positioned within the area defined at Section 2.2.9.2, and the Amount in Figures machine- printed to the right of the sign and positioned as defined at Section 2.2.9.1 and centred vertically in relation to the sign. Amended, effective 06/99 Asterisks should be printed to protect the beginning and/or the end of the Amount in Figures, ie between the $-sign and the dollar amount and/or after the cents amount. No other characters other than asterisks are permitted. The dollar amount must be separated from the cents amount only by a decimal point. 2.2.11 Visual Guides A visual guide may be provided to aid the drawer of the cheque for the location of the Amount in Figures. For machine-printed cheques a guide is optional. The form of the guide may be either a field guide or a dropout rectangle. The guide must be located within the imaginary area specified in Section 2.2.9.1. 2.2.11.1 Field Guide A field guide must be either: * Printed in a screen or lines as scan non-readable; OR * Defined by a line formed by reversing out the background printing, ie the guide may be white. The form of the field guide must be as recommended for cheques in Appendix C. The $-sign, if printed outside the guide, should touch the guide so as to limit opportunity for fraudulent alteration of the amount in figures. For security purposes, it is recommended that a background security pattern or screen is always printed inside the field guide, and when present, must always be printed as scan non- readable. 2.2.11.2 Dropout Rectangle A dropout rectangle is produced by the use of a different colour or screen density of the original colour and must be scan non-readable. The $-sign is usually printed inside the rectangle. For security purposes, it is recommended that a background security pattern or screen is always printed in the dropout rectangle. Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 29 AusPayNet September 2017 2.2.12 Stamp Duty (where applicable) Amended, effective 01/07/2005 See Section 7.3. 2.2.13 Warning Band Inserted, effective 31/08/2002 See Section 6.1.2.4. 2.2.14 Financial Institution Cheques Amended, effective 14/09/2007 Financial Institution Cheques must conform to the design and security requirements prescribed in this Publication. The words “Financial Institution Cheque” or “Bank Cheque” must be prominently printed on the face of a Financial Institution Cheque. Where Financial Institution Cheques are issued on behalf of corporate purchasers, the Drawee Financial Institution may agree with the purchaser to allow the purchaser’s name, ACN/ARBN/ABN, and company logo/brand to be printed on the Financial Institution Cheque. Any additional information printed on the Financial Institution Cheque must be less prominent than the Drawee Financial Institution’s name and logo. Care must be exercised in the display, size and placement of the purchaser’s logo, to ensure that there is no confusion over who is the drawer of the Financial Institution Cheque. The Drawee Financial Institution retains the discretion to decide whether it is prepared to allow non-corporate purchasers of Financial Institution Cheques to insert their name and other details on the Financial Institution Cheque. 2.3 Other Layout Requirements 2.3.1 Crossings A crossing is two parallel transverse lines and serves as a direction to the paying institution that the item may only be paid through a Financial Institution and not cashed. The optional addition of the words "Not Negotiable" and "Account Payee Only" which must be printed substantially between the two parallel lines. It is desirable that crossings forming part of a cheque be conspicuous and placed as close as possible to the centre of the document. It is unwise to place the crossing near any edge of a document as it may be possible to cut or tear the document and so remove the crossing. Printed crossings must not extend into the name of the Financial Institution or its branch name or into the 5/8" (16 mm) MICR clear band across the bottom of the document and must be at least 2 1/2" (63 mm) from the right hand edge of the document. The crossing must be printed as scan readable. 2.3.2 Clear Bands Paragraph deleted, effective 28/06/04 The following clear bands (see Figure 3) must be maintained: * 5/8" (16 mm) on foot of document * 1/4" (6 mm) on each side of document 12 13 Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 30 AusPayNet September 2017 * 1/8" (3 mm) on head of document Foreground printing in the Areas of Interest must not extend into the clear band areas except for: * MICR encoding in the 5/8" (16mm) band

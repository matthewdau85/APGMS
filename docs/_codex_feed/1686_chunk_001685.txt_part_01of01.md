and plaintext real(funding) or tokenized PAN for formation of the PIN block. The real PAN may be used in the creation of PIN blocks providing all temporary buffers are erased immediately after encryption of the PIN block. Tokenized PANs must be cryptographically bound to the plaintext real(funding) PAN. Buffers must be in volatile memory. The operating system must prevent other applications executing on the platform from accessing the buffers and the system shall include remote monitoring to detect modifications to the operating system. Q.17. PCI MPoC has a requirement that plaintext secret and private key material present in the Rich Execution Environment is unique per transaction. Does the same requirement apply to non- standard technologies under the SRA process? Yes, general purpose memory on COTS devices has limited protection and can only be used for temporary storage of one-time use data for the shortest possible duration and must be securely overwritten when erased. Q.18. What is the scope of a non-standard technology assessment? The scope of a non-standard technology assessment includes all components which impact the security of sensitive payment data, including PINs, PANs and the cryptographic keys used to protect PINs and PANs. For devices which include hardware based anti-tampering features, the scope includes the hardware and software executing on the device. Scoping for such devices will be performed consistent with PCI PTS. For solutions which rely upon remote security services, such as attestation and monitoring systems, the scope includes the payment acceptance device, remote service and any relevant operational processes. Scoping for such solutions will be consistent with PCI MPoC. Non-standard technologies which do not fit into either of the above categories will be scoped during the AusPayNet assessment process and communicated to the applicant. Evidence (lab reports, design details etc.) provided for the assessment is required to cover all components within the defined scope. Q.19. What technical documentation should be submitted with an NST application of a complete solution? To aid in its analysis and speed up the evaluation process, AusPayNet requires NST applications to be accompanied by clear professional descriptions of: • The overall technical architecture including both POI and backend components. • A key table listing all stored and ephemeral keys. For each key, its origin, creation method, storage and usage locations, fully defined cryptographic usage mechanisms1, and key lifetimes must be listed. • Solution management, key management and transaction data flows between the POI and solution backend components, preferably in the form of, or augmented by, ladder diagrams. • Key management and transaction data flows between solution backend components including HSMs, and for payment solution backend processing components interfaces to acquirers. • Backend automated risk management monitoring and velocity controls. Note that laboratory reports, especially those targeting card brand requirements, often assume access to the above information and do not present sufficient of the information therein for AusPayNet to arrive at a risk determination. Q.20. MPoC supports three different approval types – MPoC Solutions, MPoC Software and MPoC A&M Services. Can all three types be approved under the AusPayNet Device Approval Program? Yes. MPoC Solutions are complete solutions which can be unconditionally listed. MPoC Software (including SDKs) and MPoC A&M Services are reusable components which can be used as part of a complete MPoC Solution. Conditions will be added to the listing of MPoC Software and MPoC A&M Services detailing the additional assessment required for an MPoC Solution utilizing these components. A common design is to have an SDK (e.g. an Android aar file) and A&M software (e.g. containerized app ready for cloud deployment) submitted for assessment as MPoC Software. Once approved and listed, solutions can reference these components during the assessment of the overall solution. The final application (apk) used by the merchant would be included in the overall solution listing, together with a reference to the underlying SDK and A&M software listing. 1 For example, it is insufficient and incorrect to state that something is encrypted with an RSA or ECC public key: the precise mode of operation must be explained including padding or chaining rules, and where public keys are used to transport or agree symmetric keys which are then used to form cryptograms or in other calculations, the precise modes of use for those symmetric keys.

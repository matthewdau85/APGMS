to scams. However, we expressed concerns about implementing these amendments ahead of the implementation of the recently legislated Scams Prevention Framework (SPF), and particularly the development of the SPF sectoral codes, rules and guidelines. Of particular concern was the absence of clear guidance on how responsibility and liability would be apportioned across multiple entities involved in a scam under the amended Rules, and insufficient clarity around the scope of entities captured under the proposed changes. AusPayNet recommended that AFCA consider delaying implementation of the Rules amendments until the SPF instruments are developed, or if proceeding immediately, provide clearer definitions of which entities are captured and commit to aligning the AFCA Rules with the SPF instruments once finalised. Portability Standard On 1 July, the 12-month transition period commenced for entities intending to adopt AusPayNet's Standard for Payment Service Provider Porting of Merchant Payment-Related Data (Standard) . The Standard details a common set of requirements for the transfer of customer payment data between providers and aims to reduce frictions that can impede competition and merchant choice. In the Payments System Board Update in June, the Board indicated their expectation that industry participants comply with the Standard by 1 July 2026. This is consistent with the RBA’s previously issued Expectations for Tokenisation of Payment Cards and Storage of PANs , aimed at improving security, efficiency and competition for online card payments. Visit our website for further details on the Standard and accompanying guidelines. ATM Access Standard On 19 June, the AusPayNet Board approved the new ATM Access Standard. Intended to replace the ATM Access Code, the Standard was developed in close consultation with Members and the RBA. It will commence once the RBA’s updated ATM Access Regime takes effect. AusPayNet will coordinate the transition to ensure continuity of obligations and governance arrangements. Cross-border payments In his February letter to the G20, the Financial Stability Board (FSB)'s Chair, Klauss Knot, noted that as work has advanced in cross-border payments, many structural issues have become apparent. Addressing these issues will require significant additional work up to and beyond 2027. The FSB also welcomed Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, as the new FSB Chair. The FSB will continue with its Work Programme for 2025 , which includes cross-border payments. This year, the FSB will focus on improving the end-user experience, coordinating closely with the work of the Bank for International Settlements’ Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and other partner organisations. Inudstry taskforces CPMI’s Payments Interoperability and Extension (PIE) Taskforce held its first meeting with its new composition of members, now including AusPayNet, on 21 May. The FSB’s newly reconstituted Legal, Regulatory and Supervisory matters (LRS) Taskforce, which also now includes AusPayNet, had its first meeting in February. A key focus of this meeting was transparency (as distinct from regulation) of costs. In June, the FSB LRS Taskforce met for a workshop focusing on payment fraud. AusPayNet provided an update on the state of fraud and fraud mitigation in Australia. The FSB held its inaugural Forum on Cross-Border Payments Data in May. Forum members discussed issues emerging from data frameworks that create unnecessary friction and agreed that identifying and mapping divergences in data frameworks is a key priority. Sharing of information, supporting innovation, and engagement with the private sector are also critical to reducing unnecessary friction. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) After two public consultations, the FATF released its revised Recommendation 16, Payment Transparency, as well as the accompanying Interpretive Note in June. Recommendation 16, Payment Transparency , has the objective of preventing terrorists, perpetrators of money laundering and associated predicate offences from having unfettered access to payments or value transfers for moving their funds. As the Australian regulator, AUSTRAC will incorporate the changes into its Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) Rules in the coming years, with the FATF articulating by no later than the end of 2030. Economic Crime AusPayNet will soon release the 2025 Australian Payment Fraud Report . This report outlines recent fraud trends and how the industry (including our Economic Crime Forum) continues to respond to fraud and scams. Keep an eye out for the release of the report in the coming days. Recently, AusPayNet participated in the G20 Anti-Scam Partnership Leaders roundtable, where leaders from G20 nations proposed elevating scams as a G20 priority for enhanced international collaboration and cross-border information sharing. Domestically, we continue supporting the National Anti-Scam Centre (NASC) and are preparing for SPF consultations. We have continued contributing to rule consultations for both the SenderID Register and AUSTRAC’s AML/CTF Rules. The 16th Economic Crime Forum, to be hosted by the Queensland Police Service on 19 August, will advance two critical public-private initiatives: the Money Mule National Week of Action with confirmed AUSTRAC partnership, and the Forfeiture of Unclaimed Proceeds of Crime project. eConveyancing Payments Industry Code Earlier this year, AusPayNet concluded consultations with the Australian Registrars National Electronic Conveyancing Council (ARNECC), the RBA, prospective members and other significant stakeholders on developments in the e-conveyancing ecosystem. Given these consultations and, in particular, ARNECC’s publication of the Model Operating Requirements v 7.1, our CEO determined as at 21 March that the e -Conveyancing Payments Code be stood up. Since then, we have officially launched the membership application process, receiving strong interest from both ELNOs and financial institutions, with a number of application processes currently underway. We expect to establish the Management Committee for this new framework

The outcome of these inquiries should be taken into account before signing any contracts. 5.1.3 Other Validation or Assessments PCI DSS is not the only set of standards that exist for e-commerce and security purposes. If your industry or business requires additional guidelines for a solution, care should be taken to ensure that any provider chosen meets these requirements as well. However, it is important to keep in mind that meeting other security compliance guidelines and security certifications does not guarantee PCI DSS guidelines are met. PCI DSS does not require service providers to undergo a self-assessment or QSA-led PCI DSS assessment. This is an acquirer or payment brand determination. There are multiple reasons why it may be advantageous for a service provider to undergo such a PCI DSS assessment. 5.2 Validation Documentation PCI DSS compliant service providers should have PCI SSC documentation (for example, the Attestation of Compliance or AOC) to support their compliance status. Although service providers can redact sensitive information from this document, the intent is that the document provides enough detail about the scope of assessment within the AOC such that a merchant can determine whether the assessment covered the services being provided it. It is recommended the signatories and dates be carefully checked to ensure the AOC is credible. If enough assurance is not possible from the AOC, additional details may be requested of the service provider. Other types of documentation may be requested and accepted by the merchant. See Section 3.2.2 of the PCI SSC Information Supplement, Third-Party Security Assurance. Where PA-DSS applications support services provided, the applications in use and any expiry dates can be confirmed though the PCI SSC website’s List of Validated Applications. It is recommended the supplied documents be checked to ensure they cover a valid version of the PCI DSS, when the documents are dated, and cover the services provided. Best practice is to record the dates on these documents so revalidation can be checked on the anniversary dates. In addition to the PCI DSS documentation to support the service provider validation, the service provider may be asked to provide supporting documentation to help the merchant work on Requirement 12.8.5, which requires the merchant to identify which PCI DSS requirements are managed by the entity, the service provider, or both.

There are several aspects to this a merchant may want to consider:  The PCI DSS scope of the solution, the requirements covered by the service provider, the joint services, and use of compensating controls should be covered in the service provider’s AOC.  Per PCI DSS Requirement 12.8.5, the merchant needs to understand any requirements it is responsible for meeting.  The merchant is responsible for understanding how both internal and external ASV scans and penetration tests are conducted, who will maintain copies of test results, whether the service provider will assist the merchant in remediating any failed tests, and whether the merchant will have access to copies of the test results to meet its obligations for PCI DSS Requirements 11.2 and 11.3.  It is highly recommended a merchant understands whether the service provider will have access to its account data or its cardholder data environment, and what risk that may involve the merchant.  The merchant should be aware of nested service provider arrangements—i.e., a service provider outsourcing to another service provider—and should be aware of how those relationships affect the services being provided to the merchant.2  Merchant and service provider should both understand and have documented who is responsible for what, exactly what requirements each must meet, and how they will meet any joint requirements. 5.3.1 Legal and Contract Considerations Legal and contractual questions should be raised when selecting a service provider as well. The Third- Party Security Assurance document3 expounds on questions and guidelines a merchant may use. Additionally, any consultation on contracts or requirements may raise the following additional questions:  What information disclosure can be given as part of an audit or investigation that is not normally disclosed or is redacted due to security concerns?  What support, feedback, or general inquiry SLAs are defined as part of the service agreement? Does this include support or assistance in case of an audit or PFI investigation?  How are evolving guidelines handled? 3 PCI SSC Information Supplement: Third-Party Security Assurance Information Supplement • Best Practices for Securing E-commerce • April 2017 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

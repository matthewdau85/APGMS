into the web browser on the merchant’s payment kiosk or through the provided payment device. These non-e-commerce methods may be used/offered in card-present (CP) or card-not-present (CNP) scenarios. A merchant should implement appropriate PCI DSS controls to ensure the security of the devices and facilities offered to the public, in addition to securing its e-commerce website (or app). 2.10 E-commerce Scoping Considerations When a merchant is scoping its cardholder data environment and determining where PCI DSS controls need to be applied, it must ensure the online capture and retention of cardholder data is considered as well as the method used to process and authorize the payment. Typically, for CNP e-commerce transactions, payment card authorization is real-time as the e-commerce site has connectivity to a payment gateway or payment service provider. However, the merchant’s site may only capture the consumer’s payment card data with no subsequent authorization—for example, if card details are submitted purely to “guarantee” the order (e.g., a hotel or car rental reservation). In such cases, there is no consumer expectation that the payment account will be charged at the time of booking. The consumer payment for the services rendered is usually face-to-face (card-present)—at check-in or on collection of the rental vehicle, for example. In some scenarios, e-commerce websites not connected to a payment gateway or payment service provider offer the consumer other order/booking options in addition to the submission of card details to “guarantee” an order. For example, merchants in the hotel or car rental sectors may offer: 1. Advanced Purchase: Card details are provided with the order; the cardholder’s expectation is that the merchant will take the full value of the order/booking up-front. 2. Deposit Booking: Card details are provided with the order; the cardholder’s expectation is that the merchant will take a deposit amount (percentage of the order/booking value) up-front. These order/booking options usually set the consumer expectation that the card details supplied will be charged at the time of the order/sale. Both options 1 and 2 should be considered e-commerce transactions since they are online CNP transactions where card data is submitted by the consumer with an expectation of real-time authorization of the agreed amount. However, if the e-commerce site has no connectivity to a payment gateway or payment service provider, the merchant processes the consumer’s payment “offline”—for example, as a re-key submitted manually using a payment terminal or via a virtual terminal. As these payment card transactions are not flagged as e-commerce, be aware that this may be a breach of payment brand rules for the processing of e-commerce transactions. Merchants should contact their acquiring bank or the applicable payment brand to determine whether offline authorization of e-commerce card payments is permitted. As mentioned above, when a merchant is scoping its e-commerce payment channel for compliance assessment, it is necessary to consider of all card data flows and all aspects of payment card processing that may affect its scope, not just the e-commerce website itself. Information Supplement • Best Practices for Securing E-commerce • April 2017 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 24 2.10.1 Scoping E-commerce in Isolation A merchant considering its e-commerce payment channel in isolation from its other payment card handling activities may conclude that the scope of assessment is as shown in the blue area below, because the e-commerce website is set up to redirect the consumer to a PSP payment page. The merchant may decide that SAQ A is applicable for this channel:  All processing of cardholder data is entirely outsourced to PCI DSS compliant third-party service providers (SP).  All SPs handling storage, processing, and/or transmission of cardholder data are PCI DSS compliant.  All elements of the payment page(s) delivered to the consumer’s browser originate only and directly from a PCI DSS compliant SP.  Merchant does not electronically store, process, or transmit any cardholder data on merchant systems or premises, but relies entirely on a SP to handle all these functions.  Any cardholder data the merchant retains is on paper (for example, printed reports or receipts), and these documents are not received electronically. This information must be stored in accordance with the applicable PCI DSS requirements. As a reminder, merchants may be eligible for SAQ A, providing they meet the eligibility criteria of that SAQ. Merchants should consult with their acquirer (merchant bank) or with the payment brands directly to determine whether they are required to validate their PCI DSS compliance and which reporting method they should use.

The merchant may operate other payment channels and there may be other cardholder data flows related to or supporting the e-commerce payment channel that need to be taken into consideration when scoping the merchant’s PCI DSS environment. The diagram below illustrates some of other payment methods and cardholder data flows that may be present: Figure 7 – E-commerce in Conjunction with all Card Data

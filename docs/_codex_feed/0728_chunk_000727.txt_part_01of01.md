AUTHENTICATION Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 5 ANALYSIS AND AUTHENTICATION4 2.1 Analysis and Authentication Types5 Risk Based Analysis Risk Based Analysis is a method that adapts the rigorousness of Cardholder identity verification and device authentication processes to the risk that is associated with the CNP Transaction, based on the characteristics of the Cardholder’s interaction with the Merchant, including, but not limited to, the Cardholder’s:6 64Bgeo-location; 65BIP address; 6Bdevice type; 67Btime; and 68Btransaction pattern. Strong Customer Authentication (“SCA”) SCA is an authentication method in which the Cardholder’s identity is verified with at least two of the following independent authentication factors:7 69BKnowledge factor; something only the Cardholder knows, including, for example, a password, a passphrase, an answer to a secret question, or a PIN; 70BPossession factor; something only the Cardholder possesses, including, for example, a credit card, a hardware token, or a smartphone; or 71BInherence factor; something the Cardholder is, including, for example, a biometric feature such as a fingerprint scan, an iris scan, or facial recognition; or a behavioral feature such as type or swipe dynamics. Note: SCA may also be known as ‘strong authentication’, ‘two-factor authentication’ (2FA) or ‘multi-factor authentication’ (MFA). SCA may be realised by various measures that use at least two authentication factors including, but not limited to, in-app push authorisation requests, text or email-supplied one-time passwords, or analysis of the data points within a transaction request if these data points provide at least two of the factors. 8 4 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 5 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 6 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 7 Inserted effective 1/1/24, version 017 r&p 003.23 8 Last amended effective 1/1/24, version 017 r&p 003.23 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 7 – CARD NOT PRESENT CODE PART 2. AUTHENTICATION Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 6 Fraud Controls9 Fraud Controls are methods and practices that Acquirers, payment gateways and/or Merchants can implement to drive down fraud in CNP Transactions and include but are not limited to: One-time SMS or emails when a transaction exceeds a particular spend threshold to verify customers; Fraud systems designed to detect fraudulent transactions before a transaction is completed; and Actionable fraud alerts generated by merchant-issuer intelligence providing chargeback protection. 2.2 10BExempt Transactions10 A transaction which is an Exempt Transaction for the purposes of SCA is any of the following:11 72BRecurring Transaction, as set out in clause 2.2.1; 12 73BTrusted Customer Transaction, as set out in clause Error!

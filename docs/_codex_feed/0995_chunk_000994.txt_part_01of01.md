what. While this seems like a simple step towards improved security, organizational complexity and ongoing change makes the simple complex. It is not just about documentation (for example, a responsibility assignment matrix), but rather having a proven, best-practice process that ensures the documentation is updated and communicated on an ongoing basis. “One and done” does not cut it in the cybersecurity world. Another new requirement for PCI DSS v4.x is requirement 12.5.2 which requires the organization to undertake an annual scope confirmation exercise. Jeremy King: Yes, I was really pleased to see scoping become an actual requirement. Organizations do need to validate all parts of their PCI DSS scope every year. Because in this ever-evolving world of payments, things are changing all the time. And that leads right into documenting roles and responsibilities. Knowing where and how you are managing cardholder data, and that your staff are correctly trained, that really is common sense, isn’t it? Michael Aminzade: Absolutely, and that is a lot of what PCI DSS v4.x is all about. Being an adopter of the requirements of PCI DSS v4.x is going to help improve your organization’s payment security, will benefit you and your staff from improved processes and additional training, and help you to be ready to meet the new requirements that come into effect on 31 March 2025. Jeremy King: Michael, this has been exceedingly helpful and useful information for our community. By adopting the future-dated requirements of PCI DSS v4.x today, your business can demonstrate that it takes security seriously and is ready for the future of our ever-evolving data security landscape. Businesses can find a listing of PCI SSC-approved QSA companies and ASV companies on our website. QSA companies offer a range of products and services to support organizations in improving their security, and ASV companies provide external vulnerability scans.

customer. • Rollout of all devices should be accompanied by a user guide and training for merchants, including regular reminders about educating any new staff, particularly in retail environments where team members may turn-over regularly. PIN Security • To meet the security standards relating to PIN entry, under no circumstances should any digit of the PIN, or the completed PIN, be displayed or announced. However, audible and/or haptic confirmation of the successful entry of each digit of a PIN (but not the number itself) may be provided. Refer to the AusPayNet Issuers & Acquirers Regulations and Code Set for further details regarding PIN security requirements. Technology is fundamentally changing the world for everyone… central to our daily activities and is also increasingly the main gateway for people to access their rights… For many people, technology can provide a gateway to inclusion, or result in an enormous barrier… Australians with disability experience lower digital inclusion rates compared with those who do not have a disability.” Dr Ben Gauntlett, Disability Discrimination Commissioner, Australian Human Rights Commission “ 2. GUIDELINES FOR DESIGNING AND PROCURING ACCESSIBLE PIN ENTRY ON TOUCHSCREEN TERMINALS Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals 14 ➜ Key Questions When designing the PIN entry process for those with vision and / or motor impairment, answering the following questions may be beneficial for enhancing accessibility: • What are the accessible options provided to enter the PIN safely and securely for people who may not be able to see or feel the screen? • With a strong preference from the disability community for a tactile keypad, can this functionality be included with, or replicated realistically by, the touchscreen? • How can accessibility mode be activated by the customer or merchant and is it streamlined to allow the customer to enter their PIN quickly, accurately and securely? • How is the PIN entry solution designed so as not to compromise customer security or the disclosure of the PIN? • What are the options for users requiring alternative inputs (such as a stylus if they have dexterity limitations) or outputs (for example plugging in headphones) to be able to enter their PIN? • What designs can be included for customisation of the way the payments terminal responds, such as strengthening the haptic vibrations, adjusting the audio volume or increasing the screen contrast, so that the customer can easily and quickly change settings according to their individual needs? • Is accommodation for different retail environments considered, such as busy or noisy situations? • How does the touchscreen sensitivity accommodate for accommodate for accidental or unintended gestures or touches? • What happens if the merchant also has a vision and / or motor impairment and has to support a customer with disability when making the payment? ➜ Balancing multiple stakeholder requirements While touchscreens may create issues for accessibility in general, the security requirements for entering a PIN add additional challenges to accessible design. Solution designs need to balance multiple requirements, including: • Meeting the requirements of the AusPayNet Issuers & Acquirers Code Set. • The general obligation of banking customers to keep their PIN secret from anyone, including family members or friends. • The need for users to make payment transactions independently. • Protecting people with disability, who may also be in the category of ‘vulnerable customers’ and are more likely to experience financial abuse, from exploitation through having to share personal information such as their PINs. • Allowing financial institutions to enhance outcomes for customers and merchants by innovating through new technologies, including in the payments and touchscreen space. 2. GUIDELINES FOR DESIGNING AND PROCURING ACCESSIBLE PIN ENTRY ON TOUCHSCREEN TERMINALS Supplementary Accessibility Considerations 3 Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals 16 While the focus of these Guidelines and the consultation that informed the content was on PIN entry for touchscreen terminals, feedback around the accessible design of the overall payment experience using touchscreens was also captured, and is set out below for supplementary consideration. These additional considerations draw on, and are aligned with the Principles of Universal Design. ➜ The transaction flow It is useful for people who may not be able to see the screen clearly or at all, to have the following information provided to them in an alternative way: • the payment amount due (ideally before the PIN is entered) • which accounts can be selected and which is ultimately chosen • the status of the payment e.g. ‘authorising’, ‘complete’ or ‘declined’ • any other information that would be available to a person with sight ➜ The virtual keypad In the absence of a consistent standard for virtual keypads, combined with the variation in individual needs of people living with disability, the following considerations may lead to further enhancements in overall accessibility: • Customers may access the keypad in a variety of ways – some people may not have clear vision or any useable vision, some may have limited, or no use of hands or fingers, including circulation or dexterity impairments. Some people may also be living with additional or other disabilities such as having full or partial hearing loss, or other impairments. • The design of the keypad (including button size, layout, colour, font used), is best developed and tested in consultation with people who live with vision and / or motor impairments. • Interactions with the touchscreen should be simple and not place any excessive burdens on

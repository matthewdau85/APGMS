banks, telecommunications companies, and social media platforms in 2024. All this important work means that the payments ecosystem really is at a turning point as we head towards the end of 2023. As always, I would like to acknowledge our Members, stakeholders, Commonwealth and State governments, regulators, and our staff for their collaboration and work over the course of the year. top Update on payments reforms Consultation on reforms to the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998 ( PSRA ) - exposure draft legislation In June 2023, Treasury consulted on proposed reforms to the PSRA that would ensure all entities that play a role in the payments ecosystem could be regulated, if there was a need to do so in the public or national interest. These changes are part of the Government’s broader payment system reform agenda under the Strategic Plan for Australia’s Payments System . Following the June consultation, Treasury released the PSRA exposure draft legislation for industry feedback. The key changes in the draft legislation were in line with those proposed in the initial consultation paper, which were broadly supported in AusPayNet’s original submission: the expansion of the RBA’s regulatory remit, and the introduction of a ministerial designation power that would enable regulation of payment systems and their participants in the national interest. AusPayNet’s submission, therefore, focused on how these policy objectives had been translated into the proposed legislation. Based on our assessment and Member feedback, our submission was broadly supportive of the proposed legislative changes but suggested further review of the definition of ‘payment systems’ to ensure that the regulatory perimeter is sufficiently broad to capture all entities involved in the payment value chain. We look forward to continuing our engagement with Treasury and Members on the payment system reforms, including through the upcoming consultation on the regulatory obligations that would apply under the new licensing framework for payment service providers. Consultation on screen scraping regulation In August, Treasury released a consultation on options for regulating screen scraping practices in Australia. AusPayNet has a strategic commitment to working with Members, Government, and other stakeholders to improve cyber security in the payments ecosystem and defend against the growing threat of economic crime. As noted in Treasury’s consultation paper, screen scraping practices – which involve customers sharing their login details with third parties – generate risks that run counter to these objectives. In particular, screen scraping encourages customers to act in a way that is inconsistent with cybersecurity best practice, and can increase customer vulnerability to cybersecurity attacks, fraud, and scams as a result of personal authentication and other sensitive data being accessed, stored and used by third-party applications. In our submission, we highlighted that efficiency and customer convenience should not come at the expense of data security, particularly in the current environment of rapidly growing cyber and economic crime threats. We therefore expressed support for a carefully managed phase out of riskier practices, such as screen scraping, where the Consumer Data Right (CDR) can provide a secure alternative for facilitating customer data sharing. top Insights Sustainability in payments AusPayNet’s Emerging Technology Experts Group (ETEG) brings together a wide range of members to contribute to the assessment of innovation in payments technology. The goal of ETEG is to evaluate the potential opportunities, challenges and risks presented by technological developments for the Australian payments ecosystem, and to provide advice on how the industry can work together to address them. ETEG’s key focus areas for the coming year include artificial intelligence, digital assets, and sustainability. At its meeting in October, ETEG focused its discussion on sustainability in payments. ETEG’s goal in this area is to undertake work to better understand the environmental impact of payments technology and processes in Australia, and to help establish an industry point of view on whether any collective actions should be taken to address this impact. AusPayNet has already produced some preliminary insights into the environmental impact of the payments industry and the role that industry participants can play in driving greater sustainability; these early insights will be shared in a blog post shortly. With the support of ETEG, AusPayNet will continue to work on developing these insights throughout 2024, with a view to presenting the findings to Members and other industry stakeholders through various AusPayNet publications and events. Accessibility in payments AusPayNet’s vision is convenient and secure payments for all. To achieve this vision, we are committed to enhancing accessibility and inclusion in payments, recognising that while innovation can provide many benefits for customers and businesses, it can also create new challenges for some users. For this reason, AusPayNet developed the Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals in 2019. These guidelines were the first in the world to address access to POS touchscreen technology for people living with vision and/or motor impairments. In 2023, an independent review conducted by the consultancy firm Intopia concluded that the Accessibility Guidelines remain fit-for-purpose. To further enhance accessibility and inclusion in payments, AusPayNet is planning to undertake work on expanding the Guidelines to include a broader range of payment products and services (including mobile payments), as well as a broader spectrum of disabilities. We look forward to collaborating with Members and key stakeholders on this important topic over the coming year. Blog posts AusPayNet regularly publishes blog posts, sharing important information and insights regarding Australia’s payments system.

AusPayNet’s 2022 Payment Fraud Report shows that in 2021, while card payments grew by 8.0% to $865 billion and online spending by 8.2% to $53 billion, the incidence of all card fraud grew at a slower pace, by 5.7% to $495 million for the year. The rate of fraud on Australian card payments in 2021 was steady at 57.3 cents per $1,000 of spending, compared to 58.6 cents in 2020. Stabilisation of the fraud rate coincides with AusPayNet’s introduction in 2019 of the CNP Fraud Mitigation Framework to counteract rising rates of CNP fraud. In the three years prior to the introduction of the framework (2016-2018) the fraud rate averaged 74.3 cents per $1,000 spent. As criminals adapt and evolve their methods to take advantage of the increasing amount of time Australians are spending online, payment scams are on the rise. A recent report by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) revealed that Australians lost over $2 billion to scams in 2021. Scams are a focus for AusPayNet’s recently established Economic Crime Forum (ECF). Additionally, AusPayNet’s scams mitigation program developed alongside the Australian Banking Association (ABA), Australian Financial Crime Exchange (AFCX), and IDCARE, seeks to make Australia an unattractive target to scammers.

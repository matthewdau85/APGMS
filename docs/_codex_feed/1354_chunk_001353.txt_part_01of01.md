Rules as Code Proof of Concept (PoC) working group meeting – 9 July 2025 Original Published Date 10/07/2025 - 11:19am Tax Category Payroll Tax preparation Business accounting Description The purpose of the Rules as Code (RaC) Proof of Concept (PoC) working group is to leverage members collective knowledge and experience in co-designing and evaluating the ATO’s Rules as Code PoC. The Department of Finance is providing a Rules as Code sandpit for the PoC, along with resources to implement a limited-scope ATO use case. This meeting was held via webinar on Wednesday 9 July 2025. Key Outcomes Below is a summary of key outcomes. Note: the full outcomes and any presentation materials are available in DSP Hub. The project intent is to deliver a rules engine with an API available, and for volunteer DSPs to build and test integration (non-production, using mock data). Alongside API testing, test cases will also be created during the development of the rules engine to verify the logic implemented in Python code. Stakeholders are exploring rule statements for GST eligibility, including definitions and exemptions. The ATO will consider the potential for using formulas that feed into each other for streamlined logic reuse. The group reinforced the importance of API granularity and security, confirming that no private data will be stored. Outcomes from this phase will guide upcoming discovery sessions, where priority rules and integration pathways will be refined. Next Steps Discovery sessions on 22 and 30 July will shape next steps. For any questions about Rules as Code Proof of Concept (PoC) working group , please raise a ticket in the DSP Service desk . All versions No previous versions available.

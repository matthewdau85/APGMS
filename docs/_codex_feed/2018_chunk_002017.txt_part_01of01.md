or in relation to the NPP API Framework. NPPA has no responsibility to determine whether any implementation of the NPP API Framework may violate, infringe, otherwise exercise the patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, know-how other intellectual property rights of any third party, and thus any person who implements any part of the NPP API Framework should make their own inquiries and obtain independent advice before implementing any part of this Framework. Without limiting the foregoing, the NPP API Framework may provide for the use of technology which may be the subject matter of patents in several countries. Any person seeking to implement a solution based on the NPP API Framework is solely responsible for determining whether its activities require a licence to such technology. NPPA shall not be liable for any person’s infringement of intellectual property rights in connection with the NPP API Framework.

Important Note: Designed to promote inter-operability and standardisation, the NPP API Framework defines the key technical approach and mandatory data attributes for NPP APIs, aligned to ISO 20022 standards. The NPP API Framework includes sample APIs which are included for the purposes of illustrating how the framework could be used by participating financial institutions. For more information regarding what APIs are available for third party use, please contact your financial institution. Please note that NPPA does not host an NPP API service or offer NPP APIs for third party use on the Platform. Participating financial institutions may make their proprietary NPP APIs available for use by third parties. NPP API Framework – Publication Version 5.0 Page 5 1 Introduction The New Payments Platform (NPP) is fast, flexible and data-rich payments infrastructure that enables Australian consumers, businesses and government agencies to make real-time payments between accounts at participating Australian financial institutions. NPP Australia Limited (NPPA) has engaged SWIFT to design, build and operate the NPP platform infrastructure. This document has been jointly developed by NPPA and SWIFT to promote development of the NPP ecosystem and to assist NPP Participants, Third Party Service Providers and software developers with the development of API solutions for NPP transactions. In order to maximise standardisation and interoperability, and to provide a consistent NPP experience, NPP Participants, Third Party Service Providers and software developers are encouraged to use the NPP API Framework as a guide for the development of their own API solutions for NPP. This document provides a consolidated point of reference and an expanded view for NPP Participants, Third Party Service Providers and software developers to further their adoption of API technologies for NPP. NPPA does not mandate use of this Framework by participating financial institutions. NPP Participants that utilise this Framework for the development of open APIs or partner-based APIs are free to use this Framework, and to publicise such use, as they see fit. NPPA itself does not host an NPP API service or offer NPP APIs for third party use on the platform. Participating financial institutions may make their proprietary NPP APIs available for use by third parties. Purpose & Scope The purpose of the NPP API Framework document is to provide guidance relevant to the design of APIs in the context of NPP. The Framework is designed to support and facilitate NPP Participants’ open NPP APIs and partner-based NPP APIs, and to enable Third Party Service Providers and software developers to design payment services using the NPP. The NPP API Framework is intended to encourage innovation by establishing a set of minimum standards primarily for the benefit of Third Party Service Providers and software developers, which may obviate the need to build multiple customised APIs for interacting with each NPP Participant. NPP Participants, Third Party Service Providers and software developers may identify different or additional considerations for their API design at a more detailed level which are not covered by this document. Overlay Service Providers (OSPs) are encouraged to make available specific data usage or mandatory elements for use with the API framework. These elements are defined and maintained by each OSP and are the responsibility of that organisation. The specific purpose of this document is to: • Identify a common set of design principles and best practices that could be leveraged by the NPP community to reduce interoperability variation across core data exchanges when implementing API based technologies; • At a high level, outline considerations to ensure the NPP community has a common reference of key API design considerations and how they may be approached by the industry; and • Identify applicable standards for NPP data transfer, data constructs and security NPP API Framework – Publication Version 5.0 Page 6 Sample APIs To provide Third Party Service Providers and software developers with an understanding of how to utilise the NPP API Framework, sample NPP APIs have been included as part of the framework documentation. The sample NPP APIs include usage guidelines in .pdf and excel format as well as a JSON example. The samples include the following: • Look up of a PayID which will validate that the PayID exists and if valid return the associated short name and status - API: pain.a11.001.04 (Get Account Servicer by Alias); Please note that this API will be amended in the next version of the NPP API Framework as the BIC

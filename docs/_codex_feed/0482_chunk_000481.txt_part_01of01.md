to Customers during a HVCS Fallback Period. It makes a distinction between two relevant terms: • Posting: a Participant credits the beneficiary Customer’s account but does not make the funds available to the Customer until interbank settlement has occurred. Such credits are sometimes referred to as “uncleared funds” and denoted as a visible credit that does not yet form part of the balance of available funds. HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 148 • Availability: where a Participant enables the beneficiary Customer to make use of funds posted to the Customer’s account. This could be in advance of interbank settlement occurring. 5.7.1 Posting Participants must post funds received during a HVCS Fallback Period such that the credit entry is visible to the recipient Customer on the same day. With the exception of funds availability, Participants must treat all other aspects of the posting in the same way as normal. This includes interest accruals, which must accrue from the date of clearing not settlement, and returning payments that cannot be applied in accordance with the timeframes in Clause 4.23 of these Procedures. 5.7.2 Availability Participants should make a sufficient proportion of total incoming funds available to Customers, so that the objective of the HVCS Fallback Solution can be materially achieved. Decisions concerning the availability of funds is a matter for each Participant and could vary depending on risk appetite, however the expectation is that Participants will maximise the value of funds made available to the greatest extent possible, in accordance with their internal risk appetite. As a guide, achieving the objectives of the HVCS Fallback Solution is estimated to require Participants to make at least 80 per cent of the total value of funds received during a HVCS Fallback Period available to its Customers. 5.7.3 Risk Policy Participants must have an internally agreed risk policy that sets out the approach to meeting instruction 6.7.2 on funds availability during a HVCS Fallback Period. The policy must be documented and approved by the relevant senior personnel; and must be readily available in the event of a HVCS Fallback Period. Note: The specifics of a Participants’ risk policy is entirely a matter for the Participant and could depend on a range of factors including credit appetite, counterparty relationships, net exposures arising from incoming and outgoing settlement obligations; and the value of individual payments received. The policy should contemplate circumstances where Customer’s outbound payments are contingent on the availability of funds received. Given the potential time constraints during a HVCS Fallback Period, it may be necessary for Participants to prioritise the assessment of inbound payments that will fund outbound payments due to occur on the same day. As noted, the HVCS Fallback Solution is intended to be used in the event of a technical disruption to RITS during otherwise normal market conditions. 5.7.4 Timely Implementation Participants must be capable of implementing their risk policy during a HVCS Fallback Period, including assessment and approval of credit decisions, within the timeframes set out in the RITS Outage Runsheet. Note: Participants could consider using a value threshold to determine lower value payments that do not require individual credit assessment before the funds are made available to Customers. For most Participants, a lower bound threshold of $1mn would represent around 90 per cent of total inbound payment volume, but only 2 per cent of total value. Such a HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 149 threshold could be an operationally efficient approach to prioritising credit decisions for the remaining 10 per cent of payments within the potentially constrained timeframes. 6. Participant Outage Instructions 6.1 Operational Readiness The following instructions cover items that Participants are expected to have in place in preparation for a Participant Fallback Period. 6.1.1 Operational Readiness Participants must be operationally ready for a Participant Fallback Period. This includes: 1) being familiar with these Procedures and the Contingency Instructions; 2) being capable of making the internal system and operational changes required to send and receive payments during a Participant Fallback Period; 3) participating in contingency test exercises coordinated by AusPayNet; and 4) ensuring staff are available and contactable at all times during the Participant Fallback Period and during planned contingency test exercises. Participants must attest their adherence with these requirements in the Yearly Audit Compliance Certificate (Annexure A.2). 6.2 Participation The following instructions describe the extent to which Participants are expected participate in the HVCS when a Participant Fallback Period has been declared. Instructions for Affected Participant 6.2.1 Sending Payments The Affected Participant must use the Participant Fallback Solution provided for in these Contingency Instructions as the alternative method of sending any payments it considers to be urgent during a Participant Fallback Period. 6.2.2 Participation Opt-Out Tier 2 Participants that do not intend to use the Participant Fallback Solution if they experience a Disabling Event must have pre-agreed this arrangement with AusPayNet. Where there are extenuating circumstances in which a pre-agreed opt-out Participant needs to send payments using the Participant Fallback Solution, the Participant must obtain prior agreement AusPayNet and from the Receiver(s). Note: A list of the pre-agreed opt-out Participants will be available from the AusPayNet extranet site, such that during a Disabling Event, it is clear to other Participants

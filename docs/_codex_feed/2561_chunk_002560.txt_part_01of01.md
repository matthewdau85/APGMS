This list of PIN Service Providers is the source of PIN Service Providers that have been assessed by a Qualified PIN Assessor (QPA), validated as meeting the requirements of the PIN Security Requirements and Testing Procedures (PIN Standard), and submitted their Attestation of Compliance to PCI SSC for listing. The PIN Standard defines technical and procedural controls to assist with the secure management, processing, and transmission of cardholder PIN data during online and offline payment card transaction processing at ATMs and POS terminals. Although PCI SSC may review reports for quality management purposes, PCI SSC does not independently confirm the reports or the data or information they contain, nor does PCI SSC perform any testing or analysis of products, services, functionality, performance, suitability or compliance with the PIN Standard. PIN Service Providers interested in being Listed should contact the QPA Company that performed their most recent PIN Assessment, or click here to register for a Portal account to submit their PIN AOC directly to PCI SSC for review and Acceptance.

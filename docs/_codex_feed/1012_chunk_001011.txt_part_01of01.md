Welcome to the PCI Security Standards Council’s blog series, The AI Exchange: Innovators in Payment Security. This special, ongoing feature of our PCI Perspectives blog offers a resource for payment security industry stakeholders to exchange information about how they are adopting and implementing artificial intelligence (AI) into their organizations. In this edition of The AI Exchange, Cloud Security Alliance Chief Strategy Officer, Troy Leach, offers insight into how his company is using AI, and how this rapidly growing technology is shaping the future of payment security. How have you most recently incorporated artificial intelligence within your organization? At the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), our mission is to develop cybersecurity frameworks and best practices for the latest technology. That means we must not only study new technologies but also adopt them early to understand their implications. For artificial intelligence, we’ve taken a deliberate approach to embed it across our organization. Since we publish several research papers and best practices each month, we made sure every department—from research to training to IT to marketing—was experimenting with large language models (LLMs) and other AI tools early and often. To drive adoption, a colleague and I launched internal “AI Days,” where we partner with each department to identify opportunities where generative AI could streamline workflows or solve problems once considered too formidable. These workshops are hands-on: our IT team has used AI to accelerate coding and SQL query development; our marketing staff has built AI-driven personas to refine communications; we’ve even tasked AI agents to recommend updates to older research as technologies evolve, and we’ve developed internal bots that dynamically collect and surface CSA knowledge to all staff. The success has been significant—so much so that staff have asked us to continue “AI Days” regularly to keep pace with change. Externally, we’ve also launched our Valid-AI-ted model, which reviews compliance self-questionnaires for accuracy of completion. Much like the PCI Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), our Cloud Controls Matrix and AI frameworks use the CAIQ. By applying our AI validation, we help assure that entries into the STAR Registry—a public repository of cloud security assessments—are as accurate and reliable as possible. This is the kind of practical compliance improvement we believe AI can bring to payments as well. What is the most significant change you’ve seen in your organization since AI-use has become so much more prevalent? The most striking change is the pace of change itself. Tasks that once required weeks—such as developing code snippets or refining analytics—are now accelerated through AI-assisted “vibe coding.” It may not be the final code put into production but gives new ideas to our developers for how to address a challenge. But speed cuts both ways. Just as organizations build familiarity, the models evolve again. In the early days of GPTs, for example, prompt engineering required precise structure, and training courses emerged on how to “engineer” prompts. Within a year, the models were asking clarifying questions themselves, raising outcomes dramatically without such expertise. The same leapfrogging has occurred in capabilities like image recognition and OCR. Today, a developer can paste a snippet of code as an image into a prompt and have the model understand, troubleshoot, and even suggest solutions in real time. Similarly, AI is now embedding directly into productivity platforms—whether office applications, file repositories, or messaging channels—making the boundary between human workflow and AI assistance nearly invisible. As security professionals, we must view this with both appreciation and caution. The more seamless the integration is, the greater the potential exposure if organizations fail to segment data properly or implement governance controls. For PCI DSS environments, where the confidentiality and integrity of payment data are paramount, transparency and oversight of these AI-enabled workflows is critical. How do you see AI evolving or impacting payment security in the future? When I meet with financial institutions, I hear equal parts optimism and concern. The promise of AI is personalization at scale—merchants and payment providers will deliver unique value for customers and partners, often autonomously. But personalization must not come at the expense of the core PCI DSS principles of data minimization and controlled scope. One area of real benefit is training. Imagine security awareness training that adapts examples to each department’s exact context. EY recently reported that 94% of employees felt security became a personal goal if they had training within the last year. Now picture each scenario being tailored to show how that specific role affects overall payment security strategy. That level of relevance transforms compliance with PCI DSS Requirements from a “check-the-box” activity into a meaningful defense mechanism. AI is also poised to revolutionize compliance itself. Instead of manual reviews of data-flow diagrams or lengthy interviews to verify controls, AI could continuously validate documentation and flag changes in real time. That ensures merchants and service providers maintain PCI DSS throughout the year—not just during a QSA assessment. Finally, payment security operations are already benefiting. We hear already that Security Operations Centers (SOC) integrate AI for root-cause analysis now to uncover subtle anomalies—the proverbial “needles in the haystack”—with far greater accuracy. In effect, AI becomes an always-on analyst, augmenting human staff with tireless pattern recognition and other intelligence features. What potential risks should organizations consider as AI becomes more integrated into payment security? The first risk is over-reliance on AI decisioning without human oversight. Generative AI is inherently probabilistic; unlike deterministic static software, it may produce unexpected outputs. In payments, we’ve already

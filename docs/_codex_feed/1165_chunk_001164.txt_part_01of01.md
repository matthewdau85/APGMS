Types of authorisations You can be authorised as one of the following in RAM: Authorisation administrator – act on behalf of the business as well as create and manage authorisations for others. For more information, see Who can create an authorisation . Authorised user – act on behalf of a business using your Digital ID with a Standard or Strong identity strength. Basic user – if you’re unable to achieve a Digital ID with a Standard or Strong identity strength, you may be able to act on behalf of a business using your Digital ID with a Basic identity strength. You can be authorised for up to 12 months after which a principal authority or authorisation administrator will need to renew your authorisation , if still required. Machine credential administrator – create and manage machine credentials. See Who needs a machine credential for more information. The government online services you can act on behalf of the business in will depend on the access you're authorised for. Receive an authorisation request A principal authority or authorisation administrator need to create an authorisation for you in RAM. Once created, you will receive an authorisation request including details of the authorisation and an authorisation code via email. You will need to accept the authorisation in RAM using your authorisation code within 7 days. You can only have one authorisation for each business you are acting on behalf of. An existing authorisation is overridden if: the authorisation request you are accepting has a higher authorisation level than the one you currently hold – excluding changing from a Basic user as your current authorisation needs to be removed first your role changes to principal authority and you link the business. If you need access to a service you’re not authorised for, contact your principal authority or authorisation administrator.

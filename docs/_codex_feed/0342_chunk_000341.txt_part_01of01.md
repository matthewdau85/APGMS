test and reference samples. This test will comprise the following:  High speed machines - 10 passes of the quantity of documents specified at section 1.5.1.2 per orientation.  Low speed machines - 10 passes of the quantity of documents specified at section 1.5.1.2 per orientation. If during any pass, a jam or other operational failure occurs, then any damaged samples are to be removed and their number noted and thereafter deducted from the number of documents sorted. These damaged documents are not to be recorded as rejects. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 67 AusPayNet September 2017 Any documents rejected during a test must not be removed, but their number and pass stage must be recorded as rejects. The results of the test are to be recorded on Form 1 and signed by an appropriately senior officer of the testing Tier 1A Participating Member, refer to Attachment 1 of this Appendix. Form 1 can be supplied to the testing Tier 1A Participating Members and the Applicant as a spreadsheet upon request to AusPayNet. 1.5.2.2 The Substitution Test Testing Tier 1A Participating Members must test for substitutions in the samples. A substitution occurs when a character is misread as a character other than that which was intended. Substitutions are evidenced by 10 passes of 10 samples of each single digit document and subsequent examination of a printed report from the machine being used. Any evidence of substitutions must be carefully investigated to confirm that the report showed a definite mis-reading of a character and was not due to the settings of the reader being used. Any evidence of substitution errors being solely due to the Printing System will result in the automatic non-accreditation of that Printing System. The results of the substitutions test must be recorded on Form 2 set out in Attachment 2 of this Appendix and signed by an appropriately senior officer of the testing Tier 1A Participating Member. Form 2 can be supplied to testing Tier 1A Participating Members and the Applicant as a spreadsheet upon request to AusPayNet. 1.5.2.3 The Stress Test Ten samples from each set are to be subjected to a stress test (which is intended to replicate the folding of documents that occurs in actual use). Five samples from each set are to be folded with faces together and five samples from each set folded with backs together. The fold should cross the smallest dimension and pass through a printed MICR character. The fold is to be created by normal finger pressure and not by any mechanical means. The samples are then to be unfolded and pressed flat with hand pressure and not by reverse folding. Each sample is to be marked to indicate its treatment and included in the reader/sorter test. A separate reject rate is to be calculated and recorded for folded samples. 1.5.2.4 The Toner Adhesion Test A visual assessment by an appropriately senior and experienced officer of the testing Tier 1A Participating Member of toner adhesion and evidence of flaking is to be made after 10 passes of all folded documents, refer to section 1.5.2.3 of this Appendix. Evidence of flaking is not acceptable and requires further testing of the toner durability. A document (not one that has been folded) is to be extracted after 10 passes as the tenth pass document. A visual assessment for toner adhesion and smearing is to be made on this document by an appropriately senior and experienced officer of the testing Tier 1A MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 68 AusPayNet September 2017 Participating Member. Evidence of smearing that is attributable to poor toner adhesion is not acceptable and may require further testing of the toner durability and/or embossment. 1.6 Assessment of Results Amended, effective 22/03/06 The testing Tier 1A Participating Member must tabulate the results of each test on a separate Form 1 and compare the reject rate with the reference samples. The results for all tests (and the comparison with the reference samples) provided by each testing Tier 1A Participating Member will be collated and considered by AusPayNet. A Printing System will be considered capable of producing complying MICR encoding if: (a) there is no evidence of substitutions caused solely by the Printing System; and (b) the reject rate of the test documents: - is less then or equal to 0.25%; OR - is less than the reject rate of the reference samples; OR - does not vary relative to the reject rate of the reference samples at a confidence level of 90% or greater (this is determined by the application of a statistical method known as the Student T test). - If the results indicate that the Printing System is capable of producing complying MICR encoding, then this will be advised to the Applicant and the Printing System will then be recorded in AusPayNet's Register of MICR Printing Systems. If an interested party enquires as to the status of a Printing System they will be advised as to:  whether the Printing System is recorded in AusPayNet’s Register of MICR Printing Systems; and  if the Printing System is recorded in AusPayNet’s Register of MICR Printing Systems, that accreditation is not a guarantee that compliance will always be achieved;  of any assumptions and qualifications that were made in the testing process; and  of the Tier 1A Participating Members that conducted the testing.

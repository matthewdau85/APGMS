SIG topics are chosen by the PCI SSC Participating Organizations, which represent merchants, financial institutions, vendors, associations, and payment processors. This ensures that the stakeholders involved in implementing and supporting the PCI Security Standards can select which SIG projects would be most beneficial to their needs. SIG topics may be proposed during a defined submission period. At the close of the submission period, SIG proposals are consolidated, and presentations are prepared for Participating Organizations to review via the PCI portal. An election period is then initiated for Participating Organizations to vote on their preferred SIG topics. After voting is concluded, PCI SSC announces the results and works with the selected group to create a charter for the new SIG.

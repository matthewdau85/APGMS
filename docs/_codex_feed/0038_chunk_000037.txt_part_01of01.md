TDES. The Industry Test Strategy, describing the approach to be taken to testing and certification throughout the program, which is complementary to the approaches adopted by each of the card schemes. Collectively, this work serves as a key input to card payments system participants in developing their organisations’ own migration plans. Where are we now? Our current phase of focus (2025) is on preparation for pilot, currently scheduled for 2026. Key deliverables from this phase include: An update to the Technical Blueprint to include amendments to the relevant Australian Standard, AS2805. A migration handbook, which will provide further guidance to participants on how to go about the migration and will be the repository of lessons learned as we proceed. Industry Testing Plans and the supporting tools that participants will require. Requirements for an information management system to enable the industry to track progress. An uplift in communications and change activities as the industry mobilises. Future phases In 2026, we will focus on the early stages of industry testing and pilot, while from January 2027 onwards, we will be dedicated to the execution and rollout of the migration. What are we seeing around the world? In addition to the work being undertaken in Australia, governments and payment system operators globally are taking action, driven by national infrastructure security needs and government policy. Jurisdiction Status In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has disallowed use of TDES for encryption of government data from 2023 onwards. The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) classified TDES as a legacy standard in 2013 , recommending the use of AES. The UK Government’s National Cyber Security Centre report (Dec 2024) urges "all sectors to address the risks posed by quantum computing ASAP, accelerating their efforts." They have established Timelines for migration to post-quantum cryptography , calling for migration of critical systems by 2031. In France, Cartes Bancaires is leading the migration to AES, with the interbank network migration completed and over 80% of payment terminals AES ready. Migration to AES has been completed in Germany following a regulatory requirement to do so. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) issued an Advisory on Addressing the Cybersecurity Risks Associated with Quantum in February 2024 highlighting measures that FIs should consider as part of their quantum transition efforts. In October 2024, the G7 Cyber Expert Group (CEG) published its Statement on planning for the opportunities and risks of quantum computing , in which it "encourages jurisdictions to monitor developments in quantum computing, to promote collaboration among relevant public and private stakeholders, and to begin planning for the potential risks posed by quantum computing on some current encryption methods." These are just some examples of actions being taken to address the risks associated with quantum computing. While there are differences in the approaches of each jurisdiction, the direction and motivation to act are consistent. What are Australian regulators saying? Domestically, policy support for the AusPayNet Program is building strongly. In November 2023, the Government’s Department of Home Affairs released its cyber security strategy and action plan. This strategy includes an explicit requirement and an item in its action plan to implement quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms to prepare for the potential impact of quantum computing. The cyber security strategy also foreshadowed that the cryptography standards would be documented in the Australian Signals Directorate’s (ASD) Information security manual . ASD already prohibits the use of TDES for long-term encryption of ‘Protected,’ ‘Secret,’ and ‘Top Secret’ level documents, therefore requiring the use of AES. The Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) Payments System Board (PSB) considered the program in February 2024. Following that meeting, members of the PSB expressed "their strong support for industry efforts to ensure encryption standards continue to meet the high safety standards for card payments expected by the Australian public" and "encouraged industry to progress the migration with sufficient urgency to enable the transition to AES to be completed within industry’s estimated timeframe of five to seven years" . We expect government and regulator support for the program will only continue to strengthen. FAQs Is AES really quantum safe? AES is considered safe from advances in both classical and quantum computing. This position is supported by the various security agencies around the world, such as ASD and NIST. Should we jump to the next generation post-quantum standards? Post-quantum standards have been under development for a number of years, primarily through NIST in the United States. These standards are in an early stage of development, with limited practical usage to date. Conversely, AES is well established and supported by a wide range of technology providers. This means that the upgrade to AES would be a far simpler and well understood task than adoption of whole new standards. Do you need to upgrade ATMs given the decline in cash? It is important to upgrade all points of access to the Card Payments System. ATMs are considered essential infrastructure, especially for rural and remote communities in Australia, regardless of their declining usage, and ongoing support for cash as a payment method is a necessity. However, the rationale for the upgrade is not related to the decline in ATM usage. The upgrade is necessary to ensure that ATM transactions remain secure and protected against potential security threats. Making ATMs more secure may include replacing or upgrading the devices that protect PIN data when an ATM machine is used, installing new devices to

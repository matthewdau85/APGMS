Because TPSP involvement and services may impact the level of risk assumed by the entity when processing payment transactions, thorough due diligence is critical in determining which TPSP is appropriate and which third-party services may be needed. Defining the level of involvement of a TPSP is crucial to understanding the overall risk assumed by the entity related to PCI DSS compliance. The entity may elect to engage an outside party to assist with the assessment of the scope of services to be provided by the TPSP and the applicability of those services to the entity’s PCI DSS compliance. Questions that may help with this process include:  Given the current payment ecosystem and payment channels, what services (security, access, etc.) would affect or impact the CDE and/or CHD? How are the services structured within the TPSP facilities?  What technology and system components are used by the TPSP for the services provided?  Are additional third parties used by the TPSP in the delivery of the service provided?  What other core processes/services are housed in the TPSP facilities that may impact the services provided? What technology is used for those core processes/services?  How many facilities does the TPSP have where CHD is or will be located? Note: The scope and services to be provided by a TPSP will depend on the specific facts and circumstances and services provided. Although the foregoing list of questions may be useful in determining scope and services, this list is not exhaustive. Each organization seeking to engage a TPSP must determine what is relevant in light of the circumstances, the organization’s payment environment, the proposed TPSP’s role, and other factors determined to be important through thorough due diligence. 3.2 Due Diligence Research of the Third-Party Service Provider Based on services provided by the TPSP, the entity will need to determine a due diligence path to identify the impact a TPSP has on the entity’s PCI DSS scope. The entity should consider beginning with a preliminary review of the TPSP to ensure that the engagement does not negatively impact the entity’s PCI DSS compliance. This research may include precautions such as consulting with the acquirer, reviewing the participating payment card brand service-provider listings and websites, and requesting PCI DSS validation documentation. Please note not all payment card brands have service-provider listings; however, some payment card brand rules require certain types of service providers to be registered with the payment card brand. Additional risk considerations (that may be outside the scope of PCI DSS requirements) include assessing the TPSP’s:  Financial stability prior to contract execution or renewal  Reputation, including the review of reported complaints and litigation  Experience in providing or implementing the proposed services, including the TPSP’s ability to The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

As noted above, however, each organization must determine the appropriate due diligence process in light of its own CDE. Part of that due diligence will include a decision on what form of evidence of the TPSP’s compliance with the PCI DSS will be acceptable both initially and throughout the term of the relationship.

In some cases an acquirer or payment card brand may disallow the engagement of TPSPs due to risk that has already been previously identifed 3.2.2 Third-Party Service Provider Validation Documentation The entity may also consider requesting validation documentation from the TPSP that demonstrates the TPSP has achieved PCI DSS compliance. How and whether a TPSP must validate PCI DSS compliance is defined by the payment card brands, and required validation documentation may vary. This, in turn, impacts the types of compliance documentation an entity can expect to receive from the TPSP. Refer to the payment card brands’ websites for more information about specific brand compliance programs, or contact the payment card brands directly. The level of documentation should be commensurate with the level of risk and impact the TPSP presents to the entity’s PCI DSS compliance. The documentation

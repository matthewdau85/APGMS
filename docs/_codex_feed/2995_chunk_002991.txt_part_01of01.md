Providers may not offer this, and all workloads are deployed into shared, mixed workload clusters. In the latter case, a Customer may need to consider workload-specific Customer accounts to provide the isolation necessary. Validating that a container solution has the necessary isolation strength in place will mean choosing a publicly vetted and trusted open source or commercial off-the-shelf solution that has demonstrated a strong security track record over time, rather than building a container technology in-house. Many organizations have struggled to address quarterly and annual PCI DSS requirements for containers that may be created, run, retired and destroyed in a matter of days or hours. In some cases, a check of the container fleet may occur every week, such as for file integrity monitoring for PCI DSS Requirement 11.5, or over the course of weeks or months in the case of a penetration test. In cases where the container life cycle is shorter than the duration of a given PCI DSS control, consider sampling running instances across all in-scope container images (see Section E.9, “Elastic Resources Inventory and Control,” for further information). In addition, as part of the container instantiation pipeline, an organization may want to perform a vulnerability testing (see Section, 6.5, “Vulnerability Management) to address the challenge of implementing security controls in a highly fluid and elastic environment, as well as to evaluate the impact on PCI DSS requirements per PCI DSS Requirement 6.4.5. E.8 Virtual Desktop Infrastructure in the Cloud Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) is a virtualization technology that has its own compliance complexities that are discussed in the PCI DSS Virtualization Guidelines information supplement. When provided by a Provider as a cloud-based service offering, these complexities are compounded. The use of this technology is discussed in this context strictly as it pertains to delivery of VDI services by a Provider, henceforth referred to a Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS). Different host configurations may be provided by a Provider, which may uniquely affect environment scoping or service provider responsibilities pertaining to the many components involved, including the workstation, host system, guest OS, virtual network, hypervisor, image storage and file storage: ▪ Traditional Remote Desktop: While not commonly considered VDI, traditional remote desktops, terminal services or jump servers may also be delivered using virtualization or as a service by a Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 68 Provider. This model is addressed in the PCI Information Supplement on Scoping and Segmentation27 for administrator workstations. ▪ Traditional VDI: The virtual desktop server is installed on a guest OS. All users share a single host and memory space, although images and files may be stored and accessed from other network locations, such as Network Attached Storage (NAS), Storage Area Networks (SAN) or Virtual Storage Area Network (VSAN). ▪ Application-level VDI Workspace: Stateless VDI workspaces no longer rely on a single guest OS. Instead, components of the virtual desktop may be hosted directly by the hypervisor, making it possible for the individual applications that comprise the "desktop experience" to be hosted and served from separate hypervisors, hosts and storage repositories residing in distinct virtual network segments or security zones. Providers providing stateless VDI should consult existing guidance on implications of mixed-mode service delivery to confirm the scope of each application and data store, and meet all isolation requirements and segmentation testing requirements necessary to limit scope (if applicable). DaaS resources such as disk images and hypervisors may exist on separate networks. To ensure enumeration of all in-scope systems, all network provisions for CDE systems should follow designated paths that are identified by the responsible party’s network and data flow diagrams. When host systems and hypervisors are maintained and provisioned by a Provider, responsibility for secure configuration, patching, monitoring and testing generally falls to the Provider, and should be identified in the AOC of the Provider or responsibility matrix, or both. Similarly, where images are maintained by the Provider, storage and network access to images must be confirmed by the Provider’s AOC (see Sections 5.2, “Verifying the Scope of PCI DSS Validated Services and Components,” and 5.3, “Verifying PCI DSS Controls Managed by the Cloud Service Provider,” for further information). It is recommended that VDI disk images for CDE and non-CDE not be comingled, to ensure that non- CDE system components cannot mount CDE volumessystems that house or access both CDE and non-CDE disk images should be considered in scope for PCI DSS. To reduce the scope of the PCI DSS assessment, the Provider must have necessary segmentation in place, and take express responsibility for these controls. For Providers providing shared hosting of VDI services, the hosting solution should enforce cloud tenant separation that is appropriate to multi-tenant cloud environments (see Section E2, “Multi-tenancy,” for further information). As server configurations vary, so too Customer workstation configurations may have a significant range of applicable controls. The three most common VDI workstation types include: ▪ Zero Client: These systems provide little more than video, keyboard and mouse interface to the network host. Without a processor or memory space to host malware, zero-client configurations offer minimal attack surface, and interception of sensitive data would require physical intrusion 27 PCI Security Standards Council, Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation (PCI SSC, December 2016), https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Guidance-PCI-DSS-Scoping-and- Segmentation_v1.pdf.

of the Scams Prevention Framework Act 2025 , we stand ready to work with ASIC and the ACCC to develop the supporting codes and rules. Economic Crime Forum (ECF) The latest ECF was held in Melbourne on 25 February, coinciding with the national law enforcement meetings. The ECF agreed to develop two workgroups to: Develop a national week of action targeting money mules Clarify and determine the pathways for financial institutions to dispose of suspected proceeds of crime when mule accounts are closed or blocked. On 2 April, the post-ECF briefing was provided to electing members, with over 100 participants. The briefing attracted strong participation and support for the two ECF workgroups. Global Anti-Scam Alliance AusPayNet has joined the Global Anti-Scam Alliance (GASA) as a Supporting Member. Head of Economic Crime, Toby Evans, represents AusPayNet on the Oceania Chapter Board, which is looking at the impact of scam compounds and what is required to mitigate this growing threat. Scams are a global problem requiring a global response. By joining GASA, AusPayNet strengthens its international collaboration to combat scams and fraud. Together with our growing network of partners, we look forward to sharing insights, advancing best practices, and building greater resilience against scams across the digital economy. Stakeholder engagement Our Stakeholder Advisory Council had its first meeting for 2025 in February. At this meeting, we welcomed Cathie Armour, AusPayNet Independent Director, as the new Chair. Further, we sought the Council’s feedback and perspectives on: Our payment policy priorities (the Scams Prevention Framework, the RBA Review, Treasury’s proposal to mandate cash acceptance, and the proposed PSP licensing regime) Our leadership to coordinate the wind-down of the cheques system Our work on the transition away from the BECS Framework The review of the Card-Not-Present (CNP) Fraud Mitigation Framework The Standard for Payment Service Provider Porting of Merchant Payment-Related Data.

We look forward to updating you on our showpiece event in future editions of Payments Monitor . Brisbane event Our inaugural Brisbane Member event was held at Suncorp’s offices on 25 February. We had 46 Member representatives attend two sessions (an update on the payments strategic plan and regulatory reforms; and a panel discussion on challenges and opportunities of the BECS Transition), followed by networking drinks.

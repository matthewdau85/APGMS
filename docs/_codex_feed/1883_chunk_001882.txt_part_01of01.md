to NPP Participants, including resilience, 24/7 availability, security and the ability to meet performance SLAs. End user Businesses, corporates and fintechs, just like individuals, can use the NPP to make and receive payments. There are currently more than 70 organisations offering services via the NPP. Participating financial institutions are gradually rolling out their NPP product and service offerings to their business and corporate customers (with retail customers largely complete) which will provide more organisations with the ability to make and receive NPP payments. NPP access eligibility criteria and governance The eligibility criteria for the different NPP access points are clear and transparent and are provided for in the NPP Regulations (with the exception of being an end user which is determined by individual participating institutions in terms of their specific customer offerings) and are published on our website (www.nppa.com.au) . The key requirements are summarised below: NPP Participant Identified Institution Overlay Service Provider Connected Institution ADI or RADI licence ✓ ✗ ✗ ✗ Exchange Settlement account ✓ ✗ ✗ ✗ Incorporated company ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Required to meet technical, operational and security requirements for direct connectivity ✓ ✗ ✗ ✓ NPP access decisions for new Participant, Connected Institution and Overlay Service Provider applications, are in most instances determined by NPPA Management under a delegated authority to the NPPA CEO. Importantly, the administrative process for admitting new Participants and Connected Institutions is phased, with the assessment of initial eligibility and the entitlement to be given NPP Componentry, and assistance with installation, being a Management function. Having provisioned and installed NPP Componentry new Participants and Connected Institutions are required only to test and certify that their connectivity is compliant with NPPA’s technical requirements. The NPPA Board is expected to be involved in the determination of new NPP Participant and Connected Institution participation applications as a final step, and is in any event bound to accept each new Participant and Connected Institution that satisfies the technical requirements. The NPPA Board has 11 voting directors, including four major banks, four representatives from small to medium banks and aggregators, two independent directors with no links to the banking sector, and a director representing the Reserve Bank of Australia. The CEO of NPPA also sits on the Board as a non-voting director. Unlike other similar payment organisations in Australia, the voting rights of directors are equal, and are not proportionate to shareholding. Proportionate rights at the Board would typically give directors representing larger shareholders a significant influence over board deliberations, however, in the context of the NPPA Board this is not the case. Facilitating third party access Many organisations are seeking to leverage the NPP for different use cases and business objectives. What an organisation wants to achieve using the NPP will largely determine the most appropriate access option for them. Some organisations incorrectly assume they need to connect directly to the NPP to access the platform’s benefits, but this is not the case (as is the case with other payment streams today). Using the platform’s existing capabilities and the Osko message to make and receive payments, is likely to meet the business needs of many organisations. This requires a commercial relationship with only one participating financial institution given messages injected via any one NPP access point can access the entire NPP ecosystem and reach all available accounts. Based on our experience in handling enquiries from over 350 fintechs and other interested organisations, the vast majority simply want to be able to use the NPP in some manner (similar to the way that they access existing payment systems today). This enables these organisations to develop their core offering outside of the platform according to their business objectives. Many interested parties seeking access to the NPP do not want to connect directly because of the technical requirements that this entails, and the complexities involved in connecting to a real time payments infrastructure. Hence ensuring a competitive secondary access market to the NPP is important. Two groups of NPP participating organisations are currently playing a critical role in facilitating secondary access to the NPP for third party entities: 1) Wholesale payment service aggregators Three directly connected organisations, Cuscal, ASL and Indue, act as aggregators, who are providing wholesale payment services to their customers (i.e. they have no end retail customers of their own). The business model of these organisations is to provide access to different payment clearing streams (RTGS, Direct Entry, BPAY and cheques), as well as other payment products and services such as cards, mobile payments, ATM access and fraud prevention and management. Aggregators help to promote competition in the payments industry by providing the technology, scale and licensing required that enables smaller players to compete alongside the largest players in the industry. Collectively, these aggregators provide services to a diverse range of organisations, including building societies, credit unions, mortgage originators, smaller and regional banks, neo- banks and other fintechs (including brands such as Acorns, Square, Spriggy, Mint Payments and Adyen), as well as non-financial service organisations such as government bodies, airlines and retailers. These aggregators are actively providing access to the NPP and are collectively connecting more than 60 smaller financial institutions, thereby enabling those organisations to offer NPP payment services to their customers without having to contribute any capital to NPPA that would be required if they connected directly. We anticipate from market enquiries that there are a number of organisations providing similar services in overseas

amended. Effective 28/06/04 There are four levels of security for the printing of documents, dependent on their risk level. The number of security features to be used increases with the risk level and are to be selected from the list given in Section 6.2. The levels of security cover the minimum security features that are required to protect the document type from forgery or counterfeiting. It may be considered desirable to add to these minimum levels to further improve protection of the document. Paragraph amended, effective 28/06/04 Paragraph deleted, effective 28/06/04 Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 44 AusPayNet September 2017 6.1.1 Deposit/Voucher Level For use on:  Deposit forms  Credit summaries  Intra/internal Financial Institution vouchers  Warrants Minimum requirements:  Plain paper for MICR encoded documents  Conventional ink(s) or toner 6.1.2 Base Level For use on:  Bank supplied customer cheques Minimum requirements:  Sensitised paper for MICR encoded documents  Conventional ink(s) or toner  One ink security feature to protect the document against alteration Inserted, effective 01/07/05  One security feature to protect the document against counterfeiting. 6.1.3 Intermediate Level For use on:  Specially Printed Cheques Minimum requirements:  Sensitised paper for MICR encoded documents  Conventional ink(s) or toner  One ink security feature to protect the document against alteration  One security feature to protect the document against counterfeiting. In addition, a warning band (see Section 6.3) must be printed on all Specially Printed Cheques. Amended, effective 28/02/03 6.1.4 High Level For use on:  Financial Institution Cheques  Drafts  Money Orders Minimum requirements:  Sensitised, watermarked paper for MICR encoded documents OR Transparentising Ink on sensitised paper for MICR encoded documents  Conventional ink(s) or toner  One ink security feature to protect the document against alteration Amended, effective 01/07/05  Two security features to protect the document against counterfeiting. In addition, a warning band (see Section 6.3) must be printed on all Financial Institution Cheques and Money Orders. Amended, effective 28/02/03 Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 45 AusPayNet September 2017 6.2 List of Security Features Section 6.2 has been amended. Effective 28/06/04 The following is a list of the security features to choose from in order to meet the minimum requirements for the appropriate level. It should be noted that more than one feature may be incorporated in the same paper or ink, for example sensitised, watermarked paper. 6.2.1 Protection Against Alteration 6.2.1.1 Paper Security Features  Sensitisation - the paper is chemical sensitised to react against tampering by solvents, bleaches and acids, and reacts with a colour "flash-up". N.B. Every new batch of paper should be sensitivity tested with chemical reagents.  Watermark - a three-dimensional result is achieved at the paper making stage, providing a finely detailed design, readily identified yet difficult to reproduce via scanning devices. This is usually multi-dimensional as this eliminates the need to register the device with the print. If watermarked paper is to be used, then the front of the cheque shall be printed on the "flat" side of paper. Mould made watermark paper must be registered, i.e. no part of the watermark is to appear in the MICR clear band area. N.B. It is advisable to print onto the background of the remittance advice portion of a cheque and remittance document to avoid the potential for this paper to be used as a base for counterfeit copying, should the remittance advice be left blank. 6.2.2 Protection Against Counterfeiting Amended, effective 19/05/08 The following security features are listed in order of effectiveness, with the most effective listed first.  Thermochromic - ink that changes colour or disappears when the temperature is raised. The colour change is not to be a permanent effect. In choosing the correct ink to use the following example reaction temperatures should be noted: Product Full Colour No Colour or Changed Colour 20°C 16°C 25°C 25°C 22°C 31°C 27°C 24°C 33°C This ink can be printed via wet/dry offset, letterpress, gravure, flexo and screen printing processes.  Micro Printing - text set in very small letters (up to 0.25mm in height) that can be easily read through a magnifying glass, but which appears to the unaided eye to be dashed or solid lines.  Metallic - provide effective defence against colour scanning, usually by reproducing a darker image. Must be restricted in use to small areas, such as company logos.  Transparentising Ink - may be used to simulate a watermark which can be viewed through the paper when held up to light. The ink must be printed on the reverse and may fluoresce. When using transparentising ink it must only be used on the Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 46 AusPayNet September 2017 cheque portion of the document thus protecting against the remittance portion being used to generate fraudulent cheques.  Metameric – are inks printed in two colours that appear the same colour when viewed under a standard light source but appear different when viewed under a different light source. Amended, effective 31/08/2002  Fine Line Security Patterns – are to be printed as patterns of intertwining lines. They cannot be printed as a screen. Fine lines are difficult to copy or scan and should be printed in lighter/pastel shades. A line

Last Updated: 18 January 2023 Your privacy is important to us. Our goal is to provide you with a personalized online experience that provides you with the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) has been written to describe the privacy-related terms and conditions under which PCI Security Standards Council (“PCI SSC”, “we”, “us” or “our”) makes its web sites, web pages, domains, portals, registries, mobile apps, other events and online resources, and corresponding materials (collectively, the “Web site”) available to you, including but not limited to resources used to provide or in connection with our online meetings, events and other services. The Privacy Policy discusses, among other things, how data obtained in connection with your use of the Web site may be collected and used.

By using the Web site, you agree to be bound by the terms of the Privacy Policy (including its appendices, which are hereby incorporated into the Privacy Policy). If you do not accept the terms of the Privacy Policy, you are directed to discontinue accessing or otherwise using the Web site.

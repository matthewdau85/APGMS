with requirements in Annex A.3.4. C. Acquirer Audit FAQ C.1. Does the IAC Code Set Volume 3, clause 2.4.5 Privacy of Communications apply to ATM transactions? No, this requirement applies only to EFTPOS terminals. C.2. When a cardholder performs a ‘balance inquiry’ can the ATM store the PIN in secure memory, to be used for subsequent transactions? EMV transactions currently allow this, and more specific requirements of the Code Set Volume 6, Annexure G.4.11 & G.4.12 noting that this is in contravention of PCI requirements. C.3. Would on-us transactions that are not sent over an open network apply to AusPayNet Audit requirements? No audit requirements will apply, however, there are a general IAC requirement for Issuers to comply with ISO 9564-1 : Basic principles and requirements for PINs in card-based systems C.4. What is the scope of PAN security as required by the issuer audit? The Issuer audit must consider PANs in the following situations: 1. Interchange links, where PANs must be encrypted as per A.3.1(h) 2. Systems handling PIN over open networks as per A.3.4 PAN can be excluded from the scope of the annual audit for issuer systems not listed above. C.5. Requirement A.1.1(a) asks for a list of deployed EFTPOS terminals, SCRs and EPPs. The definition of terminal was changed in 2018 from a PIN entry device to any device used to accept card payment transactions. SCRs and other terminals without PED deployed prior to changes to the Code Set introduced do not need to be approved devices. Is it necessary to list such SCRs when completing the annual acquirer audit? Yes, all card acceptance terminals connected to the payments network need to be listed as part of the annual audit. Where a device is exempted from being an approved device, a note should be added to the audit report under requirement 1.1(o) confirming the devices were deployed prior to the rule changes in 2018. C.6. Clause 2.2(f) from Code Set Vol 3 requires ATM payments applications released after 2021 to have been reviewed by the Acquirer or a trusted third party and to have been shown to contain no security vulnerabilities or other security weaknesses. What types of evidence are sufficient to address this requirement? The purpose of this requirement is to have an assessor review the ATM software. The requirement does not prescribe specific review techniques or evidence collection. A list of known acceptable techniques are listed below: - A signoff form from the Acquirer confirming the ATM software has been reviewed and that no security issues were found. - A penetration test performed by an independent assessor which did not find any significant security issues. - A report showing evaluation of the software against an industry standard security program, for example PCI Secure Software Standard. - Details of the software developer’s security practices including the results of their security testing. Other techniques offering equivalent assurance may also be considered acceptable.

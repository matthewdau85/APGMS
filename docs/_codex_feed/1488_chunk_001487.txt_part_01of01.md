The final meeting for this working group was held on 8 June 2023. This group is now closed. As part of the 2020 Budget Digital Business Plan, the government announced the Modernising Business Registers (MBR) program. This program will establish a new business registry service delivering one place to register, view and maintain your business information with government. The Modernising Business Registers Design Working Group (MBR DWG) helps shape the design direction of the MBR program. It allows digital service providers (DSP) to have input into design proposals, external service interactions and business-focused matters. The working group aims to keep DSPs aware, informed and engaged on the MBR design. The MBR DWG membership includes a diverse range of stakeholders in the software industry.

A Tier 2 Framework Participant must, however, have the agreement of its Representative to sponsor a person as a Debit User. Where a Tier 2 Framework Participant has the agreement of its Representative to sponsor a person as a Debit User, the Representative will be deemed to have given the indemnification set out in clause 7.7. The arrangements under which a Tier 2 Framework Participant's Representative agrees to the Tier 2 Framework Participant sponsoring a person as a Debit User are proprietary.333 Note: a Framework Participant may be a Debit User. In such a case, the Framework Participant is responsible for complying with the provisions of this PART 7 as a Sponsor and as a DE User.334 7.2 Sponsor Approval A Sponsor may approve a person as a Debit User without reference to any other Framework Participants, but before that approval it must carry out a credit risk assessment of the prospective Debit User and satisfy itself that the financial strength, integrity and reliability of the prospective Debit User qualify it as a suitable Debit User in BECS. A Sponsor is not obliged to approve any prospective Debit User.335 Documentation brought into effect between the Sponsor and a Debit User in connection with the Debit User's participation in BECS in that capacity and the Sponsor's obligation, as Sponsor, to ensure the Debit User meets certain obligations and responsibilities required of it under this PART 7 (see, for example, clauses 7.5, 7.10 and 7.11) is proprietary.336 Note: Ledger FIs have recourse against a Sponsor for claims arising pursuant to the Debit User's participation in BECS: see clauses 7.5(b) and 7.6. Each Framework Participant may use a logo approved by the Company in connection with direct debits in BECS on any of that Framework Participant’s proprietary documentation published in accordance with these Procedures and relating to the provision by it of direct debit services through BECS. Each Framework Participant acknowledges and agrees for the benefit of the Company that its entitlement to use any such logo ceases immediately upon its ceasing to act in the capacity of a Framework Participant in BECS, and that subsequent use of the logo by it will be taken to be an infringement of the Company’s rights in that mark. 337 333 Amended effective 1/1/15, version 054 r&p 005.14 334 Inserted effective 20/3/13, version 049 r&p 001.13 335 Last amended effective 31/3/00, version 019 r&p 001.00 336 Inserted effective 31/3/00, version 019 r&p 001.00 337 Inserted effective 31/3/00, version 019 r&p 001.00 BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES PART 7: DIRECT DEBIT SYSTEM Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 64 7.3 Debit User Approval – User Identification Number If a Sponsor approves a person as a Debit User, the Sponsor must obtain for, or assign to, the prospective Debit User a User Identification Number in accordance with clause 5.12.

less expensive product may be more costly in the long term if you need to replace it sooner than others, as it is no longer being supplied with patches and may become a way for criminals to enter your network. 5 Planning of Decommissioning It is common for IoT systems to require some form of personalization during their deployment; from configuration with Wi-Fi settings through to details about the users, and installation of certificates to provide secure network access. This information can often be sensitive and important to remove prior to disposal of the IoT device; if a malicious party was to obtain a device used in your network, could they extract the network certificates or details, and use that as part of an attack? It’s vital that there are plans for the decommissioning of devices once they are no longer required or need to be replaced. The C2 Consensus baseline takes note of this need in the ‘Reprovisioning’ capability and considering not only how you will use an IoT system, but how you will securely end its use can assist with the purchase and deployment decisions. IoT System Security Checklist/Questions The following questions are recommended for those planning the purchase and deployment of IoT systems, to help the secure deployment, use, and decommissioning of these systems in an environment. Does the device accept or facilitate payments, and how is this securely disabled or configured this for use? Is it included in the cardholder data flows for the network? Does the deployment plan consider how to integrate the IoT device(s) into your environment in compliance with the PCI DSS? Note: This may be required even for devices which do not facilitate payments, or are not involved directly in cardholder data flows, depending on how they are deployed. Is the device designed with security in mind, and has it been tested against relevant standards such as ANSI/CTA-2088-A? Does the vendor of the product guarantee updates for a set period of time, and have a history of on-going product security support? How does this align with the expected deployment period of the product in your environment? What connectivity does the product require to provide the features required for its use and maintenance, including security updates? Is it possible to isolate the product onto its own network segment? If network isolation is required and/or provided, how is this protected from change by operators of the device (e.g., by the user connecting to a different Wi-Fi network, or network segment)? How can the product be securely decommissioned to ensure sensitive information is cleared before the device leaves your control? i Council to Secure the Digital Economy (CSDE), The C2 Consensus on IoT Device Security Baseline Capabilities, https://csde.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CSDE_IoT-C2-Consensus-Report_FINAL.pdf

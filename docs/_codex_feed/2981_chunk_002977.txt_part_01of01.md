to reduce the risk to any residual data left behind on Provider systems. However, Customers should be aware that leaving potentially unknown quantities of encrypted data on Provider systems after their agreement has been terminated is likely to be a violation of their data- retention policy. 6.4 Incident Response and Forensic Investigation Incident response, escalation procedures and forensics investigations, to ensure timely and effective handling of all security incidents, are critical to both Customers' and Providers' operations and essential elements as part of overall PCI DSS compliance. However, there are distinct differences and challenges both in handling of forensics data and how the incident response processes will need to adjust for each cloud service category. Customers should work with their Providers to document security incident response, forensics and data breach notification-related roles and responsibilities as part of SLAs and contractual agreements, taking into consideration the need to comply with security incident management (i.e., PCI DSS Requirements 12.5.3, 12.8.3 and 12.10) and service provider requirements (i.e., PCI DSS Requirement 12.9). 6.4.1 Incident Response Customers need to know when an issue, incident, or breach has occurred and the impact to their environment or to their data. Issues, incidents and data breaches should be communicated by the Provider to all affected Customers in a timely manner. Customers should also consider whether their Provider requires all Customers to immediately notify the Provider of potential breaches in their environments, allowing the Provider to respond more quickly to contain the breach and minimize its impact to other Customers. Based on the type of cloud service category used – relating to facilitating the storage, processing or transmitting of cardholder dataeach phase of the incident response life cycle (e.g., as per NIST 800-61rev2) is affected at a different level. (Note that other international standard frameworks for incident response are ISO/IEC 27035 and ENISA "Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation.") Definitions of what constitutes a breach or incident requiring notification between Customer and Provider should be agreed upon. Notification processes and timelines should be included in SLAs, and incident response plans should include notification requirements. In some cases, renegotiation of the SLAs may be required if the agreed-upon response time or viability of the information critical to the investigation is not adequate or sufficient. 6.4.2 Forensics Investigation The potential for Customer data to be captured by third parties during a breach investigation should also be clearly understood. Incident investigation may involve consideration of legal and jurisdiction Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

Forensic functionality should be specified in service level objectives (SLOs) incorporated into the SLA between the Customer and the Provider. SLOs may include requirements for notification, identification, preservation and access to potential evidence sources.17 Customers and law enforcement agencies require, and rely on Providers for, forensics support, and these obligations varies depending upon cloud service category as noted below.18 ▪ SaaS: The capability for forensics is dependent upon the Provider’s support, as Customers have no control over the Provider’s environment. Forensics examiners may need to rely on high-level application logs available from the SaaS application. SLOs may include evidence sources such as logs from applications, web, database server, guest OS/host, portal, network capture and billing systems. ▪ PaaS: The capability for forensics is shared between Customers and Providers. Customers control the developed and hosted software application, and hence control forensics capability within the application, automatic logging to an external log server can be configured to capture the applicable audit trail. However, since the actual operation of the application is within the Provider’s controlled infrastructure, Customers must clearly identify Providers' responsibilities with respect to forensics investigation. SLOs may include evidence sources such as logs from the application, web, database server, guest OS/host, portal, network capture, billing and management portal. ▪ IaaS: The capability for forensics is shared between Customers and Providers. Customers have greater control over the range of potential evidence sources; however, some essential data only exists with Providers and under their control. Customers must clearly identify Providers' responsibilities with respect to forensics investigation. SLOs may include evidence sources such as logs from the cloud network perimeter, DNS servers, virtual machine monitor, APIs, host OS, network capture, billing and management portal. Investigating potential breaches in cloud environments brings additional challenges. For example, compromised VM instances may be deactivated before anyone is aware that a breach occurred. It may be nearly impossible to properly investigate a breach when the source of the breach is no longer in use or even in existence. 6.4.3 Breach Notification Customers should contractually require data breach notification from their Providers in clear and unambiguous language, taking into consideration the need to comply with local and global regulatory/breach laws, data privacy, security incident management and breach notification requirements. 17 Cloud Security Alliance, Security Guidance for Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud Computing V4.0 (Cloud Security Alliance, 2017). https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/download/security-guidance-v4. 18 Cloud Security Alliance, Mapping the Forensic Standard ISO/IEC 27037 to Cloud Computing (Cloud Security Alliance, June 2013). https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/imf/Mapping-the-Forensic-Standard-ISO-IEC-27037-to- Cloud-Computing.pdf.

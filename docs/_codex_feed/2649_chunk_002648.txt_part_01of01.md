considered to be large. The size of a large organization can be defined by:  The number of physical locations, payment channels, payment points of interaction, employees, and devices across the company,  The overall number of continents, countries, cities, and locations in which that company conducts business,  The number and complexity of online or Internet-based services, or  Having a large volume or high value of payment card transactions.

Varying interpretations can lead to projects, groups, and departments that are out of step with the rest of the organization. Determining roles, responsibility, and ownership is a vital step in the effective management of PCI DSS controls. Responsibilities and ownership assignments will be unique for every large organization. For example, in a large organization comprised of a central corporate office with numerous franchises, the following questions may arise:  Is the corporate team solely responsible for PCI DSS compliance at the franchise sites?  What responsibilities do the franchise owners have?  If franchise owners do have PCI DSS compliance responsibilities, how are these defined?  Who oversees the definition of these responsibilities?  How is PCI DSS managed and implemented at each of the franchise sites? To effectively manage PCI DSS compliance efforts and expectations, large organizations may choose to:  Manage assessments centrally as one large effort, manage them separately as smaller units, and perform PCI DSS assessments on parts that fit together logically, or  Have a combination of these approaches. Regardless of the management and assessment model selected, it is essential that large organizations maintain centralized oversight of PCI DSS compliance activities to ensure that the governance structures across the different business units are aligned and that the entire organization remains compliant at all times. 4.1 Determining Roles, Responsibilities, and Ownership It can be challenging for a centralized oversight team to understand how ownership and responsibility for the various aspects of PCI DSS compliance are distributed across the entire organization. Although ownership and responsibility are sometimes used interchangeably, they are different. Having ownership in an organization represents an individual who is ultimately accountable. Typically, this is documented in legal contracts and formal business documents, such as job descriptions and company policies. In contrast, those who have been assigned responsibilities are answerable for ensuring that assigned activities, tasks, or functions are met. An important concept is that, unlike ownership, the responsibilities can be shared across individuals and teams. To ascertain who has ownership of PCI DSS compliance activities, large organizations should first determine where the organization performs payment card functions. The original decision to accept credit and debit cards as a form of payment is generally made by the business owner or leadership, and requires a formal agreement signed by a representative of the organization and held by the legal or procurement business units. Typically, these contracts describe who owns the relationship with the payment card organization, financial institution, acquirer, processor, or third-party provider. Reaching out to business leaders who signed these contracts can provide useful information about who uses, stores, or transmits payment card information. Although these business leaders may not be able to directly state ownership, starting with a top-down approach can aid in directing inquiries regarding ownership and responsibilities. After an organization’s payment channels and associated business owners are identified, other individuals or roles within those business units might be able to provide additional insight into how PCI DSS compliance activities are performed and managed.

Examples of individuals or teams who could provide this detail include, but are not limited to, the roles and teams in Table 1.

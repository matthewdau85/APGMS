12.9 Cheque Items Deemed Dishonoured (a) Cheque Items drawn on the Defaulter which have been lodged with Survivors but which have not been settled and are taken to be dishonoured by operation of Section 70A(1) of the Cheques Act 1986 (Cth) must not be included in calculating each Survivor’s bilateral net position in relation to the Defaulter for the purposes of the bilateral net settlements referred to in Regulation 12.7. “Lodged” in this Regulation 12.9 has the same meaning as it has in Section 70A(1) of the Cheques Act. Notwithstanding anything in the Procedures to the contrary, if such Cheque Items are returned to the Survivors, those Survivors are not required to give value for those Cheque Items. (b) In order to assist Survivors to identify Cheque Items that are taken to be dishonoured in the event of the operation of Section 70A(1) of the Cheques Act, each Tier 1 Framework Participant is required to supply to the Company: (i) a complete listing of all its BSB Number and account number ranges that apply to non-Cheque Items, within 30 days of: (A) in the case of existing Tier 1 Framework Participants: the date on which this Regulation becomes effective; or (B) in the case of any subsequent Tier 1 Framework Participants: the date on which they are notified by the Secretary that their application for membership as a Tier 1 Framework Participant has been accepted; (ii) details of any changes to its BSB Number and account number ranges that apply to non-Cheque Items as soon as practicable. (c) The Company will maintain a consolidated listing of these BSB Number and account number ranges on its extranet. 12.10 Time and Manner of Revised Settlement (a) If an FTS Event occurs then on the day of the occurrence of that FTS Event, a multilateral net settlement figure for each Survivor will be recalculated by the Reserve Bank for a Revised Settlement using the settlement figures that were used to calculate the multilateral net settlement positions for the Failed Settlement but excluding all amounts due to or from the Defaulter. (b) On the day on which settlement figures are recalculated in accordance with Regulation 12.10(a), the Reserve Bank will notify each Survivor of the multilateral net amount due to or by that Survivor as part of the Revised Settlement.

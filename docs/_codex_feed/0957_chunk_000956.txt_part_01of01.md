Alicia Malone: That sounds like that has been a great document in the works for some time now. So, in addition to producing this comprehensive guidance document, the Council also announced important modifications for merchants validating to Self-Assessment Questionnaire A, or commonly referred to as SAQ A. What can you tell us about these changes? Lauren Holloway: Well, before I go into that, it's important to remember that SAQ A includes only the PCI DSS requirements that are applicable to merchants with account data functions completely outsourced to PCI DSS compliant third parties where the merchant is retaining only paper reports or receipts with account data. And SAQ A merchants are either e-commerce merchants or they may be mail order, telephone order merchants. Basically, they're all card-not-present merchants. And these merchants don't store, process, or transmit any account data in electronic form on their systems or premises. So, the changes we made to SAQ A recently were to remove these two PCI DSS Requirements 6.4.3 and 11.6.1 for payment page security. And we also removed Requirement 12.3.1 for a targeted risk analysis because this targeted risk analysis was only there to support Requirement 11.6.1. We also added an eligibility criteria for merchants to confirm that their site is not susceptible to attacks from scripts that could affect the merchant's e-commerce systems. Now, regarding this new eligibility criteria, we received a lot of questions about that eligibility criteria, and we recently produced an FAQ, that Alicia mentioned, to help clarify exactly what that eligibility criteria means and how a merchant can confirm that their website is not susceptible to script-based attacks that could compromise a merchant’s e-commerce systems. So, in the FAQ, we clarify that merchants can confirm this either by using techniques such as, but not limited to, those that are spelled out in PCI DSS Requirements 6.4.3 and 11.6.1 to protect the merchant's webpage from scripts targeting account data. Now, these techniques may be deployed by the merchant, or they could be deployed by a third party. Alternatively, the merchant can obtain confirmation from the merchant's PCI DSS compliant third-party service provider, or payment processor, that is providing the embedded iframe. And this confirmation would be when implemented according to the third party's instructions, the third party's solution includes techniques that protect the merchant's payment page from scripts attacks. We also clarified that a provider of third-party scripts is not considered a third-party service provider, or TPSP, for purposes of SAQ A if the provider's only service is providing scripts that are not related to payment processing and where those scripts cannot impact the security of payment account data. Now, it's important to note that these requirements were only removed from SAQ A, and they are still in the standard. Alicia Malone: That is a good distinction to make. And this is all so much great information. What other guidance might be helpful when it comes to PCI DSS assessments? Lauren Holloway: Well, as we all know, artificial intelligence is a hot topic right now, and we've been hard at work to produce some new guidance when it comes to integrating artificial intelligence into PCI assessments. In fact, this guidance is hot off the press and has just recently been published. These guidelines address best practices for assessors and include key coverage areas such as informing clients of AI involvement, obtaining the client's consent, and providing assurances about the security of client data and the accuracy of assessment results. Another key coverage area is using AI in reviewing artifacts, creating work papers, conducting remote interviews, and generating final assessment reports. The guidance also covers the importance of data handling protocols, AI system validation, ethical use, and regular updates to ensure the security and accuracy of outputs. An important part to remember in this guidance is that AI is a tool, not an assessor. Human assessors remain responsible for all findings and final decisions, ensuring that AI's role is to enhance expertise rather than replace it. Alicia Malone: This is so exciting to have this new AI guidance. I'm sure these new guidelines will be a really helpful resource for assessors navigating the new world of AI. So, Lauren, where can our listeners find all of this new guidance? Lauren Holloway: So, all of this guidance, including the AI guidance, SAQ A, the new FAQ, and the new guidance about implementing the e-commerce security requirements, can be found on the Council's website. Our Document Library houses most of this, but you'll also want to check out the FAQ page on our website. The new FAQ is number 1588. I would recommend subscribing to the Council's PCI Perspectives blog to receive the latest information directly to your inbox as soon as it's released. Alicia Malone: That's great. Well, thank you so much for joining us on Coffee with the Council , Lauren. It's so insightful to learn more about all of this new guidance, and I'm sure our merchants and assessor companies will find this information to be very helpful. Lauren Holloway: My pleasure, Alicia. Happy to be here today. I hope all these clarifications and new guidance are helpful. Like what you’ve heard?

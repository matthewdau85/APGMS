or key component, which is used in its current form. “Private Key” means that key of an entity’s asymmetric key pair, which can only be used by that entity. In the case of an asymmetric signature system, the private key defines the signature transformation. Note: The term private key differentiates this key from the secret key of a symmetric algorithm. “Public Key” means that key of an entity’s asymmetric key pair which can be made public. In the case of an asymmetric signature system the public key defines the verification transformation. “Registration Authority” has the same meaning as Local Registration Authority. “RSA” means the name given to an algorithm for public-key cryptography. “Secret Key” means a cryptographic key used with a symmetric cryptographic algorithm that is uniquely associated with one or more entities and must not be made public. “Split Knowledge” means a condition under which two or more parties, separately and confidentially, have custody of components of a single key that, individually, convey no knowledge of the resultant key. “Symmetric Key” means a secret key used with a symmetric cryptographic algorithm which uses the same key for encipherment and decipherment. “Tamper Evidence” means a process that makes unauthorised modification to the device easily detected. “Tamper Responsiveness” means a process that detects the intrusion attempt and destroys the sensitive contents of the device.

KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 26 KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS [Informative] This Annexure, to be used in conjunction with Annexure A, contains the Key Injection Facility Requirements to be used by the Company in carrying out an assessment of a Key Injection Facility as set out in clause 3.6 of this Code. B.1 Key Injection Facility (KIF) This facility is a secure environment which encloses the key injection process, housing the key generation/injection device plus any Terminals, PEDs and KLDs whilst they are being loaded and prior to securing for dispatch. The level of security afforded by this facility will depend on the minimum security requirements of the devices housed and used within that facility.73 KIF Requirements Ref 74 B.1.1 Key Injection Facilities shall inject keys only into approved SCDs. This includes, but is not limited to, Terminals, PEDs and KLDs. The SCDs shall be approved by AusPayNet for their intended purpose.75 5 B.1.2 Key Injection Facilities that include hardware devices/systems for managing keys (e.g., generation and storing) shall ensure those hardware devices/systems are approved by AusPayNet or PCI as per these requirements or comply with the requirements of clause B.2.18. This includes HSMs and any associated system, such as a PC, to which the HSM is attached and that the cleartext keys or components pass through. 5 B.1.3 A KIF, including all processes related to key management (e.g., key generation and injection), shall be implemented securely within an environment which meets the definitions of a Controlled or a Secure environment in Annex H of Reference 4 (see KIF Audit Guide), and shall be operated under dual control. 3 B.1.4 The environment shall remain secure until all keys or other secret data and useful residue from such secret data and have been removed from the environment or destroyed. 2 73 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 74 This reference number refers to numbers in the “Key Injection Requirements Cross Reference Table” document in the KIF Audit Guide (refer to clause A.3). 75 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 27 KIF Requirements Ref 74 B.1.5 Any hardware used in the key injection process shall be monitored and a log of all key-loading activities maintained for audit purposes. This log must be protected from unauthorised modification. 34 B.1.6 Auditable records shall be maintained on all SCDs processed by the facility, from the time of receipt through to dispatch to ensure detection of lost or stolen equipment. The record (which must be protected from unauthorised modification) should contain but is not limited to the following information: sender; receipt note number; manufacturer; serial number of the device; operations carried out on device. recipient; confirmation of receipt; and dispatch note number. B.1.7 All SCDs received by the facility shall be accounted for and any discrepancy between the quantity and serial numbers of the devices sent and of those received shall be notified to the sender and owner and investigated. B.1.8 All SCDs dispatched from the facility shall be accompanied by an itemized record of the devices dispatched. The recipient shall notify the KIF of any discrepancy between the record of items sent by the facility and the SCDs actually received. B.1.9 The KIF operator shall ensure that any new staff involved within the KIF or who have access to keys or key components, are subject to appropriate probity checking (e.g., identity verification, reference check, criminal record check) such as those required for Australian Financial Services License holders for employment of Responsible Officers (RO) as outlined in ASIC policy statement (PS 146) or equivalent.

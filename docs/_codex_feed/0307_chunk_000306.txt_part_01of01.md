- may be used to simulate a watermark which can be viewed through the paper when held up to light. The ink must be printed on the reverse and may fluoresce. When using transparentising ink it must only be used on the Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 46 AusPayNet September 2017 cheque portion of the document thus protecting against the remittance portion being used to generate fraudulent cheques.  Metameric – are inks printed in two colours that appear the same colour when viewed under a standard light source but appear different when viewed under a different light source. Amended, effective 31/08/2002  Fine Line Security Patterns – are to be printed as patterns of intertwining lines. They cannot be printed as a screen. Fine lines are difficult to copy or scan and should be printed in lighter/pastel shades. A line weight of 0.05mm to 0.30mm is recommended, ie lines are to be printed as fine as possible and are to be scan non-readable. Amended, effective 08/2001  Guilloche - this is a free standing fine line design, which can be overprinted, either visibly or invisibly, onto existing security patterns.  Rosette - as per guilloche. However they are more symmetrical.  Rainbow or Split Duct - this method of design can be achieved reprographically or mechanically on the press and relies on a subtle merging of images from one colour into another. Creates difficulty in all methods of counterfeiting.  Security pantograph – a design feature whereby a hidden word or similar appears when the document is photocopied. This feature may not be compatible with Image Capture technology. This must not intrude into the Amount in Figures and its Protection Area. It is preferable that it does not intrude into the other Areas Of Interest (AOI).  Optically Variable Devices – features with multiple reflective images usually on a silver metallic backing. The feature can be a 3D or 2D image where the image or colour changes when the viewing angle varies. Holograms are one type of OVD. Another type of OVD permits the viewing of text through a device. If the device is to be applied over the Payee’s Name, Amount in Words or Amount in Figures, duplicate that information for example in smaller type and place the device over the duplicated text.

The band is to assist the recipient of such documents by calling attention to certain security features that are wished to be made obvious. The text for the band should be kept as simple as possible and may be printed as scan readable or scan non-readable, but must be visually legible in the original document (minimum 6 point type). It is generally printed on the front, but when printed on the reverse, there must be a notice on the front of the document directing attention to the presence of the band on the reverse. The band or notice must not interfere with any other information printed on the cheque and must not be printed in the MICR clear band, right-hand side clear band, or the area for the Amount in Figures. Some examples of suitable text for the Warning Bands are shown in the “Frequently Asked Questions Regarding Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms” document available from the AusPayNet website.

It must detail at least one of the security features that have been utilised to protect the document against counterfeiting, and, with the exception of the security pantograph, it must state that the absence of the feature could indicate a fraudulent document. Where a security pantograph has been used as the only feature to guard against counterfeiting, the warning band may state that the document contains inbuilt security features. 6.4 Ink Coverage Amended, effective 19/05/08 Care is to be taken that the background security design provides sufficient visible ink coverage to afford protection against attack. To achieve this, the following principles need to be observed ;  For security reasons, it is preferred a fugitive colour other than the foreground colour printing be used; i.e. more than a single colour is printed on the front of the cheque The security background design should allow sufficient ink coverage to protect the document from attack. (see example below)  Background Colours: for ease of recognition the cheque background is best printed using one or more pastel shaded spot colours. Each colour needs to exhibit the highest degree of fugitivity/sensitivity to chemical attack and difficulty to replicate or colour copy. To ensure the printed product affords the best in image friendliness as well as in document security the spot colours shall not exceed

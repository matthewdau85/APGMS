Not to be present for contactless responses. 70 4. The Authorisation Response Code is the actual response code and, depending on the ARPC method implemented by the scheme, may be used by the Issuer in generating the ARPC cryptogram. Where both TAG 8A and DE.39 are present, TAG 8A shall have precedence and shall be passed to the Card unaltered, otherwise a rejection may occur when the ARPC cryptogram is presented to the Card. In the absence of TAG 8A, DE.39 may be mapped and provided to the Card as TAG 8A. In 0220 messages TAG 8A is an ATM generated value and must be provided to the Issuer.71 5. The Issuer host may receive duplicate ATC values for each authorisation when the previous authorisation request resulted in an online PIN failure. Issuers should consider not automatically declining transactions solely due to this condition as an indication of fraudulent activity.72 Note: ATC means Application Transaction Counter, which is maintained by the chip card application (incremented by the chip), that provides a sequential reference to each transaction. Issuers use the field in ICC card transaction validations. 73 6. For 022x messages, TAG values should be taken from the original 0200 transaction with the exception of TAG 8A which is an ATM generated value and must be passed to the Issuer unaltered. 74 7.

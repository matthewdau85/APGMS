CASE STUDY Validated Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE)™ Solution Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, LLC www.pcisecuritystandards.org We’re excited to offer a world class payment processing system that ultimately provides our customers with sound peace of mind. It’s been a pleasure working with Bluefin to develop a strategy, technical solution and action plan to achieve our final product. Todd Spangler, SRVP & General Manager, The Hillman Group Card data breach security is not a one-product-fits-all selection. Card data exists in various forms in merchant systems and is exposed to vulnerabilities that a single security product simply can’t address. Rather than build higher walls and stronger security measures, Bluefin recommends that merchants devalue the card data in their systems rendering it useless to hackers. A holistic approach to devaluing card data which includes a P2PE solution, can not only protect the data roundtrip, but may also reduce the total cost of compliance by potentially reducing PCI DSS CDE scope.

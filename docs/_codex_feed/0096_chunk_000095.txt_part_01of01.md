group. The ECF is delivering impactful fusion and response tactics through three joint operational working groups, which aim to develop intelligence referrals and create disruption opportunities for law enforcement. These projects include UK accent bank impersonation scams, UK accent bond and term deposit scams, and remote access scams. ECF workshops have delivered ‘follow the money’ intelligence packages to ASIC and compiled biometrics data of scammers that has been disseminated to UK partners. This data will be washed against offshore holdings to aid in the identification of criminal networks and their proceeds of crime. Industry and government representatives continue to provide positive feedback that the workshops are providing the opportunity for the kind of whole of ecosystem collaboration that is imperative in stopping scams at source. Australian Financial Review 2023 Banking Summit On 28 March, AusPayNet CEO Andy White appeared on the Scams, cyber and digital trust panel at the AFR Banking Summit, taking part alongside Ben Young, Westpac’s Head of Fraud; Bruce Young, APRA’s Executive Director, Technology and Data; Suneeta Sidhu, ASIC’s Acting Executive Director, Financial Services and Wealth; and Richard Harris, a partner at Gilbert + Tobin. The panellists discussed the growing threat of scams, one of the biggest challenges currently facing the banking and payments industry. Talking about effective action to prevent nefarious activities, Mr White emphasised the need to stop scams at source, and the importance of the industry working together with digital platforms, telecommunications companies, internet service providers, government, regulators, and law enforcement agencies. This was a well-received session that provoked some interesting audience questions at its conclusion. AusPayNet’s program to become an Authorised Standards-Setting Body (ASSB) Since the end of 2022, AusPayNet has developed and embarked on a program of work to enable us to become an authorised standards-setting body (ASSB), a concept endorsed by the government in response to the Review of the Australian Payments System . The program of work comprises several key workstreams as follows: • Governance • Enforcement • Standards • Monitoring • Independence • Authorisation. AusPayNet has been focusing on the governance and standards workstreams, primarily in: Considering the most appropriate company structure (and delegations) to adopt for AusPayNet’s future role as an ASSB Assessing its current regulations and guidelines, and existing processes for developing and approving standards, in an ASSB capacity. As part of this work, AusPayNet is conducting an ongoing consultation process with the industry through various forums, stakeholder and member meetings. This consultation process will ensure the industry is kept informed on the program's progress and that any feedback is considered. eConveyancing Code Over the last year, AusPayNet has been working with its Members and other key industry stakeholders to create an industry framework for eConveyancing Payments. This framework will provide governance over financial settlement of online property transactions and will be managed by a new AusPayNet management committee. The procedures governing this framework are scheduled to be finalised by the end of June. ISO 20022 migration On 20 March, the HVCS successfully adopted the ISO 20022 message standard, marking one of the most significant transformations of the payments system in recent times. Coordinated by an AusPayNet team, led by Program Director Robert Magee and Program Manager Mel Gauci, the migration is the culmination of four years of collaboration between regulators and participants in the Australian payments industry and has been completed in alignment with the global upgrade of the cross-border payments system coordinated by Swift. ISO 20022 payment messages can carry richer, more enhanced and structured data, and so the migration means significant improvements to process-automation, interoperability and corporate customer experience in Australian payments. Financial institutions will be able to create seamless experiences for corporate customers and ultimately deliver faster, cheaper, transparent and more accessible payments. For a more comprehensive update on the progress of the ISO 20022 Industry Migration Program, please see our Migration Monitor newsletter. Cross-border payments Since delivering its Priorities for the next phase of work , the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has published its Priority actions for achieving the G20 targets . This articulates specific action items across the themes of: Payment system interoperability and extension Legal, regulatory and supervisory frameworks Cross-border data exchange and message standards. Additionally, some further action items have been identified that cross all priority themes. These actions – identified by the FSB, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and their partner organisations – will be foundational in helping deliver the quantitative targets of faster, cheaper, accessible and transparent cross-border payments. They also acknowledge the critical partnership and the cooperation required between the public and private sectors to deliver the targets, not just within the G20 but beyond. The April edition of Cross-Border Payments Round-Up provides a summary of the FSB’s activities, responses to consultations and other actions being undertaken to support and successfully implement the roadmap and domestic cross-border payment priorities. The safety of mobile payments A Daily Mail article published last month warned Australians of “the dangers of saving their credit card details on their mobile phones so they have digital tap-and-go convenience”. In response to that article, we published a blog post that considered the purported dangers of mobile payments and demystified them, concluding that these payments are safe. AusPayNet remains committed to ensuring that end-users of the Australian payments system are well-informed about the safety and security of the payment options available to them.

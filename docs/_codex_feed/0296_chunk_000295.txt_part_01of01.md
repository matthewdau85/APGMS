Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 20 AusPayNet September 2017 2. Cheques 2.1 Types of Cheques 2.1.1 Customer Cheques Supplied by Financial Institutions Amended, effective 13/09/11 These cheques are usually supplied in book form and are often of the size 2 9/16" x 6 1/4" (64mm x 159mm). They are normally personalised with the name of the customer printed on them. 2.1.2 Specially Printed Cheques Amended, effective 19/05/08 These cheques are usually used by companies and businesses, can be designed to show the customer's name, customer logo and/or brand. The layout of these cheques is usually designed to suit accounting software packages to aid machine printing or computer infilling and may be printed in either cut-sheet or continuous form, see also Section 5. The positioning of the details is in many cases determined by the requirements of the particular equipment or software package used. Australia Post’s requirements for the four-State delivery bar-code are not compatible with the design and security requirements for cheques as detailed in this Publication. The four-State delivery bar-code is therefore not to be printed on cheques, nor should the payee’s address. See also Section 7.1. 2.1.3 Financial Institution Cheques Inserted, effective 31/08/2002 This is a special category of cheques drawn by a Financial Institution on itself. Financial Institutions Cheques include instruments drawn by banks (traditionally called “bank cheques”), building societies, credit unions and other authorised deposit-taking institutions within the meaning of the Banking Act 1959, where the Financial Institution is both the drawer and drawee. General requirements for the layout of Financial Institution Cheques are described in Section 2.2.14. 2.1.4 Cheques for Machine Printing Renumbered, effective 31/08/2002 These are documents completed by accounting machine or computer printer and are usually of the business variety. The positioning of the details is in many cases determined by the requirements of the particular equipment or software package used. If a non-impact printer is used, please also refer to the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Technical Specifications, Section 4.3 – Non-impact MICR printing. Customers designing their own documents to suit the requirements of a particular system must still observe the principles of layout detailed in this section and procedures for approval in Section 2.3.13. Amended, effective 19/05/08 Australia Post’s requirements for the four-state delivery bar-code are not compatible with the design and security requirements for cheques as detailed in this Publication. The four State delivery bar-code is therefore not to be printed on cheques, nor should the payee’s address. See also Section 7.1. Amended, effective 19/05/08 Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 21 AusPayNet September 2017 2.1.5 Continuous Cheques for Machine Printing Renumbered, effective 31/08/2002 Documents, usually of the business variety, which are printed on continuous stationery must be guillotined or burst before issue to remove the sprocket hole selvedges. Only slit perforations or micro-perforations are permissible on any edge (see Section 5). Cutting devices, used for the removal of sprocket holes and for document separation, must allow for the correct positioning of any encoding in relation to the reference edges of the document and give clean edges to vouchers. When the selvedge on continuous documents is not perforated, guide marks must be provided to indicate the correct guillotining position. Australia Post’s requirements for the four-state delivery bar-code are not compatible with the design and security requirements for cheques as detailed in this Publication. The four State delivery bar-code is therefore not to be printed on cheques, nor should the payee’s address. See also Section 7.1. 2.2 General Requirements for the Layout of Cheques Cheques have been divided into a number of "areas" which provide for insertion of information to assist with both manual and electronic processing by Financial Institutions. Except where specifically stated, dimensions of areas are dependent on the amount of information to be entered, whether by handwriting, typewriter or other machines. A suggested document layout showing placement of various details is illustrated in figures 2 and 3. Many variations to design are acceptable, subject to the specifications contained in this publication and the approval of the relevant Financial Institution. The following data elements (described below) are designated as Areas Of Interest (AOI), therefore the foreground must be printed as scan readable: * Financial Institution Name and domicile * Customer Name * Account Title and/or Trading Name (if applicable) * Payee * Amount in Words * Signature(s) * Date * Amount in Figures and $-sign * Not Negotiable Crossing (if applicable) * Stamp Duty Panel (if applicable) It is recommended that printing of data in the AOIs should be in a sans serif font. Text must be in a size of not less than 8 points and preferably 10 points or larger. The Amount in Figures must be in a size of not less than 10 points and preferably 12 points or larger.

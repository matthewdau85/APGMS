With the International Payments Service, participating financial institutions can process the final domestic leg of an inbound international payment via the NPP. The data richness of the underlying payment message enables the inclusion of additional data when processing an international payment, which is not possible using the Direct Entry and RTGS systems. Data such as the full legal account name of the sender and other identifiers can be carried from the country of origination through to the receiving bank in Australia, supporting full transposition of data without any truncation. This means participating financial institutions can perform necessary due diligence and meet AML/CTF compliance requirements, hence, enabling safer and faster processing of inbound international payments. All NPP participating organisations are obliged to join the International Payments Service to receive the inbound international payments via the NPP. The mandatory compliance requirement to subscribe to the service is 1 December 2023 for Participants and 30 April 2024 for Identified Institutions.

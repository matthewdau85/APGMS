Upon receipt of such notice, QSA will be entitled to control, and will assume full responsibility for, the defense of such matter. PCI SSC will cooperate in all reasonable respects with QSA, at QSA's expense, in the investigation, trial and defense of such claim or liability and any appeal arising there from; provided, however, that PCI SSC and/or its Members may, at their own cost and expense, participate in such investigation, trial and defense and any appeal arising therefrom or assume the defense of any PCI DSS Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) Agreement December 2017 Copyright © 2008–2017 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

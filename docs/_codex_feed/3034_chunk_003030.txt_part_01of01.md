scans on its own and provide evidence of compliant scans to the merchant; or o The hosting provider can undergo an ASV scan as part of each of its merchants’ ASV scans.  Determine whether the service provider will provide scan reports and whether the service provider will assist with any vulnerability corrections/remediation. Ultimately, it is the merchant’s responsibility to ensure its hosted environment receives a passing result on a quarterly basis from appropriately scoped ASV scans. 7.6 Penetration Testing of E-commerce Environments PCI DSS Requirement 11.3 for external and internal penetration testing applies to e-commerce environments as well. As with ASV scans, a merchant may not have control over the penetration testing process. The following best practices apply to merchants using third-party e-commerce solutions:  Ensure the service provider is conducting the annually required penetration tests per PCI DSS Requirement 11.3.  Understand and be notified when the test will be performed to ensure minimal downtime for customers.  Understand whether the service provider will assist with any remediation necessary to correct findings or whether the merchant is fully responsible for correction.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 57  Ensure the service provider provides enough information on the systems to be tested to cover those services and systems provided to the merchant.  Additional information on penetration testing can be found on the PCI SSC website document library. 7.7 Best Practices for Securing e-Commerce  Use TLS 1.1 or higher when transmitting cardholder data internally (for example, at cardholder data ingress and egress points) throughout the network per PCI DSS Requirement 4.1.  Due to the dynamic nature of e-commerce environments and frequent changes to websites and web applications, consider implementing a web application firewall (WAF) per PCI DSS Requirement 6.6 or additional intrusion-detection technologies per PCI DSS Requirement 11.4.  It is also recommended that firewall rules be configured to ensure unwanted traffic does not access (both ingress and egress) the network per PCI DSS Requirement 1.2. It is important to understand the type and nature of any firewalls installed in a service provider environment that controls access to services or environments provided to the merchant.  Follow PA-DSS when internally developing and implementing payment applications/shopping carts to help ensure that the application will follow good coding practices and support PCI DSS compliance per PCI DSS Requirement 6.3 and PA-DSS Requirement 5.  Consider using third-party payment applications that are PA-DSS validated and noted on the List of Validated Payment Applications as “acceptable for new deployments” (see the PCI Council website for the current List of Validated Payment Applications). o Note that some payment brands require the use of PA-DSS validated payment applications where third-party payment applications are in use. Merchants should consult with their acquirers or the payment brands to understand applicable requirements. o The correct installation of a payment application is critical to the protection of card data. The payment application’s PA-DSS Implementation Guide (obtained from the payment application vendor) should be followed when installing and configuring the payment application to ensure that the product is implemented securely and in a manner that supports PCI DSS compliance.  Regularly review any links (such as URLs, iFrames, APIs etc.), from the merchant’s website to the payment gateway to confirm the links have not been altered to redirect to unauthorized locations.  Per PCI DSS Requirement 5, it is recommended the merchant check with its service provider to ensure anti-virus/anti-malware software is running on the systems provided to the merchant. If the service provider is not running AV software on the merchant’s behalf, it is recommended the merchant understand why and implement a solution of its own for those systems. It is also recommended a merchant have AV software running on the systems it manages.  PCI DSS Requirement 10 details that a change-detection solution be in place. Typically, existing logging and monitoring tools can be configured to comply with PCI DSS requirements but it is worth explicitly asking the service provider whether a change-detection solution is in place. Information Supplement • Best Practices for Securing E-commerce • April 2017 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 58  Merchants are advised to ask their service providers about the intrusion-detection/prevention systems and file-integrity monitoring in place according to PCI DSS Requirement 11.4 and 11.5. They are also advised to ensure their own systems are being monitored for intrusions. 7.8 Implement Security Training for all Staff  Ensure all staff are trained to use systems securely and to follow defined procedures. Training should include awareness of potential security threats per PCI DSS Requirement 12.6 and the appropriate action to take in the event of a suspected breach per PCI DSS Requirement 12.10.4.  Train technical staff to manage properly security including firewalls, digital certificates, and encryption. (PCI DSS Requirement 12.6.1)  Train all internal staff to be aware of general security issues such as social engineering techniques used by unauthorized individuals to gain access to areas with cardholder data. 7.9 Other Recommendations  Assign a specific team member(s) to monitor and report on all security alerts issued by the card brands and other security

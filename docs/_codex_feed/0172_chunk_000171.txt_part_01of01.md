across borders data related to payment processing, risk management, or fraud and financial crime prevention.” The second paper is the ‘ Final report: Recommendations for Regulating and Supervising Bank and Non-bank Payment Service Providers Offering Cross-border Payment Services ’. It provides six recommendations for authorities to consider with respect to payments service providers operating in cross-border payments within their jurisdictions in order to assess risk and develop appropriate strategies to deliver consumer protections and oversight of licensing, registration and compliance with AML/CTF compliance programs. Similar to the CPMI PIE Taskforce, in December 2024, the FSB invited firms that offer cross-border payment services and relevant industry associations to nominate senior representatives to serve on the FSB’s Taskforce on Legal, Regulatory, and Supervisory matters. AusPayNet was successful in its nomination and looks forward to working with the FSB on its implementation of its policy recommendations, as well as to addressing any other legal, regulatory and supervisory frictions that have been identified as significant impediments to achieving the goals of the G20 Roadmap. Data Exchange and Message Standards The FATF will be holding its Private Sector Collaborative Forum (PSCF) in Mumbai on 25-27 March 2025. This will include the uplift to Recommendation 16, Wire Transfers. In January 2025, CPMI announced further steps to promote the adoption of its harmonised ISO 20022 data requirements for more efficient processing of cross-border payments. Firstly, CPMI will maintain the harmonised data requirements at least during the G20 cross-border payments programme until end-2027. Secondly, to support maintenance and encourage global adoption of the harmonised data requirements, CPMI will establish a joint panel with members from the ISO 20022 global market practice groups. Finally, CPMI will promote and support industry efforts to develop global ISO 20022 market practice guidelines for fast payments based on the harmonised data requirements. Other In terms of monitoring the KPIs that underpin the targets set out by the Roadmap, the FSB committed to reviewing the methodology annually. In December 2024, the FSB published its Annual Progress Report on Meeting the Targets for Cross-border Payments: 2024 Methodology document . The FSB has revised the methodology to calculate the speed and transparency KPIs for retail payments. The change is to the calculation methodology for speed. The FSB methodology is complex, but the change is designed to remove any skew of speed data within a corridor by a single payment service provider. The BIS Innovation Hub continues its innovative exploratory work on cross-border payments. They have released their Interim report; Project Rialto - Improving instant cross-border payments using central bank money settlement . This Interim Report demonstrates the technical feasibility of retail cross-border payments using interlinked FPSs together with an automated foreign exchange wholesale conversion layer that allows the use of central bank money as a safe settlement asset. We look forward to working with you through 2025.

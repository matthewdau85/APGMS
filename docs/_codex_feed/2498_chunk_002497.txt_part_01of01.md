Long Time Payment Security Expert to Lead the PCI SSC WAKEFIELD , Mass., 17 January 2024 – The PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) announced today that Gina Gobeyn has been named Executive Director for the PCI SSC effective January 8, 2024. As Executive Director, Gina will drive the organization’s strategic direction and oversee the PCI SSC senior leadership team and staff in implementing it. Gina will be succeeding Lance Johnson who is retiring after successfully leading the PCI SSC as Executive Director since 2017. Gina comes to the PCI SSC after a successful nearly 18-year career at Discover where she most recently served as the Chief Risk Management Officer, Payment Services. During her time at Discover, the payments industry has undergone dramatic changes, and she held several leadership positions responsible for payment data security. Prior to Discover, Gina worked in Information Security for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. “We are thrilled to welcome Gina Gobeyn as our new Executive Director,” said Lib de Veyra, Chair of the PCI SSC Executive Committee. “Gina knows the PCI SSC, our industry stakeholders, and the many challenges that the payments industry is facing every day. Having served in a senior role at Discover, she brings a level of payment security expertise that will be of tremendous benefit to the PCI SSC. She was the ideal pick for this role. We also would like to thank Lance Johnson for his guidance over the past 6 years. His steady leadership during COVID and this period of remarkable change within the payments industry has put the PCI SSC on a path to continued success.” “I am excited and deeply honored to be leading the PCI SSC,” said Gobeyn. “I have had a front row seat for nearly 18 years in seeing the incredible value the PCI SSC has brought to the payments industry throughout the world. Payment data is safer today because of the great work that has been done by the PCI SSC. Around the globe, the PCI Security Standards are recognized as the gold standard for securing payments. We are a shining example of what can be accomplished when an industry comes together to lead and works together towards a common goal. As the payments industry changes at a lightning pace, it is more important than ever that payment security standards and supporting programs keep up with that change. I look forward to leading the future direction of the PCI SSC and our industry during this exciting time.” Gina is a graduate of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and is in the process of completing an Executive M.B.A from the prestigious Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern. She lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota with her husband Barrett and their two children. In her free time, Gina enjoys traveling and exploring new places with her family, hiking and CrossFit training.

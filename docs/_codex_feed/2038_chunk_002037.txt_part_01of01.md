Customers provide their explicit authorisation for payments to be processed from their bank account in advance of any payments being processed. This authorisation is captured in the creation of a digital payment arrangement, referred to as a ‘PayTo agreement’. Customer experience Guidelines and prototypes are available to assist in the design and delivery of a consistent customer experience. The CX guidelines focus on the authorisation process and also take into account the relevant experiences from those designed for Consumer Data Right. How PayTo works A PayTo agreement serves as a record of the customer’s authorisation for payments to be initiated from their account by a specified third party. It is typically authorised within the customer’s internet or mobile banking environment, benefiting from the bank’s secure authentication practices in place today. Illustrative customer experience (authorisation in payer customers’ banking app): 7 | PayTo Service Overview v2.0 PayTo agreements are stored centrally and securely All PayTo agreements are created, stored and maintained in a central database, the Mandate Management Service, or ‘MMS’. The MMS is owned and operated by NPP Australia. Payment initiation Once a PayTo agreement has been created and authorised by the payer customer, the relevant third party, via its sponsoring institution, can request a payment initiation message to be sent to the payer customer’s financial institution. Business rules for the PayTo service provide assurance that the payment initiation messages will be acted upon by the financial institution holding the payer customer’s bank account. These defined rules include provisions relating to risk and liability. Third parties using PayTo to initiate payments can easily access PayTo agreements that they are a party to via APIs with the financial institution or Connected Institution providing them with PayTo services. PayTo agreements can also be accessed by the payer customer’s financial institution. • Customer authorisation of PayTo agreements • Payment initiation requests by third parties • Maintenance of agreements APIs New Payments Platform Mandate Management Services Addressing Service Clearing Service Settlement Service Payment Initiation Service NPP Participants/ Connected Institutions/ Identified Institutions* *If offering PayTo services Customers & Third Parties Merchants Customers FinTechs Corporates • Creation of PayTo agreement records • Payment processing • Maintenance of agreements NPP PAG Overview of PayTo connectivity: 1.

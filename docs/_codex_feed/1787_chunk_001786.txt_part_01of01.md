Australian Payments Plus (AP+) will partner Australia’s leading drinks and hospitality business Endeavour Group and LAB Group to bring a new digital identification service to Endeavour Group customers across its retail brands including Dan Murphy’s, BWS, Jimmy Bring’s and Shorty’s online services. The solutions being provided by AP+’s digital identity solution ConnectID and LAB Group will enable Endeavour Group to meet the new identity verification requirements for same-day alcohol delivery. AP+ will be working with Endeavour over the coming months to integrate ConnectID into the online Endeavour infrastructure, which will provide an easy and safe digital identity solution for consumers purchasing products through Endeavour Group’s online retailers. ConnectID Managing Director, Andrew Black said his team was delighted to be working with Endeavour Group on a solution that would meet legislative frameworks and benefit consumers. “We have invested much time and effort to safely and securely reducing the need for the oversharing of data and providing consumers with the ability to reuse their Digital ID - giving the individual more confidence and control of their own data,” Mr Black said. ConnectID is aimed at creating ‘digital trust’ between customers and business and the ability to seamlessly combine identity with payments transactions and provides a simple and secure way of complying with the upcoming changes to NSW Liquor Act. “ConnectID acts as an exchange between identity providers – organisations such as banks that securely hold identity data on behalf of their customers - and merchants or government departments and other relying parties such as the Endeavour Group and their brands that need to verify who they are dealing with or receive identity information that they can trust,” Mr Black said. “While ConnectID securely facilitates the identity verification or data exchange, it does not ever see or store the identity data. Identity providers store consumer identities and take responsibility for providing this secure information only under the consent of the identity owner. In this way, the identity owner – the consumer – controls who receives and uses their identity data,” he said. ConnectID, was the first non-government operator of a digital identity exchange to be accredited under the Australia Government’s Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF) in September 2021. Australian Payments Plus has been working closely with all four major banks which strongly support ConnectID. Liquor & Gaming NSW introduced regulatory reform in June 2021 for same-day alcohol delivery after the COVID-pandemic further accelerated demands for greater convenience with customers opting for contactless delivery. Retailers who deliver liquor on the same day are now required to electronically verify the identity of the purchaser at the point of purchase or account creation.

This Strategic Working Group (SWG) session was held online on 28 May 2025. Key outcomes Summary Below is a summary of key outcomes. Note: The full key outcomes and presentation materials are available in online services for DSPs . Welcome The meeting commenced with an Acknowledgement of Country and a Maori welcome. It was noted that ATO Co-Chair Elissa Walker was unavailable, and Fawad Abro would be co-chairing the meeting from the ATO. Ecosystem Scan An update was provided on the expected Parliamentary sitting calendar for the remainder of 2025, with discussion focusing on the potential legislative timelines affecting Payday Super and other tax-related measures. The group acknowledged that legislative schedules could influence the speed at which reforms are introduced and enacted. Future of Work The group covered the Future of Work report on AI in employment, which categorises AI use in these processes as high-risk. Broader implications for tax data and the regulation of AI technologies were discussed. Members explored the risks associated with AI across tax processes and the need for robust governance. A proposal emerged to form a working group to explore the applications of AI interacting with tax data, with the intention of working in conjunction with any changes to the Operational Security Framework (OSF). Concerns were raised about potential limitations placed on DSPs using AI compared to tax agents, prompting discussions on regulatory clarity and consistency. Security, Privacy & AI This agenda item explored how a suite of ISO standards (27001, 27017, 27701, 42001) could streamline DSP compliance by providing a unified framework for security, privacy, cloud, and AI system governance. Members discussed how these standards can be mapped against the OSF and Consumer Data Right (CDR) obligations to reduce complexity and audit burdens. eInvoicing Updates were shared from both the New Zealand and Australian Peppol Authorities about eInvoicing adoption. New Zealand’s adoption strategy focuses on scaling up volume, with new procurement rules driving agency uptake and expectations for requirements on large suppliers to be introduced. Australia is targeting onboarding of large businesses and there are interim targets to hit by December 2025 in anticipation of a mandate. Both MBIE and ATO emphasised the importance of DSP support and shared their commitments to their ongoing communications strategies as part of their adoption plans. Rethinking Collecting Identity Documents The group discussed new approaches to handling identity documents to address privacy concerns and data breach risks. A legislative proposal was shared that would require identity documents to be deleted within 72 hours, with organisations instead relying on metadata to demonstrate compliance. The idea received support, particularly in the context of expanding verification obligations. Members considered the roles of legislation, best practice guidance and digital identity in changing organisational behaviours. A further update from ATO on digital identity development was actioned for a future meeting. Any Other Business An update was given on recent discussions regarding the future of tax administration. The importance of transparency and collaboration between the ATO and DSPs was emphasised to ensure aligned messaging. Next meeting date The next face to face SWG meeting will be held in Brisbane 26 June 2025. Participation is available to those Digital service providers listed as SWG members for the 2025 year.

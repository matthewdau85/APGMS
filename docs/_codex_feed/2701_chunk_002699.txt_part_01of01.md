component of the call is handled by a different technology pathe.g., IVR or some type of redirection to a web payment process. In terms of technology dependency on the entity’s telephone infrastructure, technologies can be further classified as either:  Telephony based – Where the technology application is wholly dependent on the entity’s telephony infrastructure, effectively using voice or DTMF tones, through the use of the telephone keypad, to facilitate the transaction.  Digital based – Where the technology application sends a message or email to the customer with a link to a PCI DSS compliant web-based payment page where the customer is invited to input their PAN and SAD using a connected device such as smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer. Both telephony-based and digital technology-based types are capable of supporting both attended and unattended customer-experience options. In addition, all four classifications of technology type (Telephony Attended, Digital Attended, Telephony Automated and Digital Automated) have the potential to reduce the scope of the PCI DSS, devalue the account data, and potentially ensure no CDE exists. Note: See Appendix C, “Payment Call Environment-identification Tree,” for a chart that allows the reader to identify their telephone environment and consider the type of scope-reduction technology that is appropriate. 6.2.1 Attended Transactions The terms “attended” and “unattended” transactions are used generally in the face-to-face/card-present payment channel and work equally well when describing telephone-based transactions. A typical “transaction journey” for “attended” transactions might be:  When telephony-based technologies are deployed (pause-and-resume, see Section 6.5.1): 1. The customer and order details are spoken by the customer to the agent. 2. The agent enters the customer and order details into a system.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 30 3. The agent initiates the pause-and-resume system to temporarily halt the recording and informs the customer to provide their CHD and SAD verbally. 4. Using the desktop application, the agent enters the customer’s details. 5. The recording is resumed and the agent confirms this to the customer. The agent completes the transaction, supporting verbally as appropriate. 6. The agent hears all the CHD and SAD. 7. The agent then receives confirmation that the payment is authorized and communicates that, or any other outcome returned from the PSP, back to the customer.  When telephony-based technologies are deployed (DTMF): 1. The customer and order details are spoken by the customer to the agent. 2. The agent enters the customer and order details into a system. 3. The agent initiates the DTMF masking (also known as “clamping”) application and informs the customer (to keep their data secure) to input their PAN and SAD using their telephone keypad. 4. Using the desktop application, the agent monitors the customer’s progress to complete the transaction, supporting verbally as appropriate. 5. The agent hears flat tones and sees asterisks depicting the payment card numbers appear on their screen, perhaps only displaying the last four digits, putting the agent in a position to support the customer. 6. The agent then receives confirmation that the payment is authorized and communicates that, or any other outcome returned from the PSP, back to the customer.  When digital technologies are deployed: 1. The customer and order details are spoken by the customer to the agent. 2. The agent enters the customer and order details into a system. 3. The agent initiates the digital application and sends the customer a link to a secure internet payment page. 4. The customer validates the URL, confirms the transaction amount and the delivery address, submits card account data into the payment page and provides the 3DS authentication parameters (where required). 5. The agent monitors the customer’s progress to complete the transaction, supporting verbally as appropriate. 6. The agent and customer then receive confirmation that the payment is authorized, or any other outcome returned from the PSP. 6.2.2 Unattended Transactions A typical “transaction journey” for an “unattended” transaction might be: Information Supplement • Protecting Telephone-Based Payment Card Data • November 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 31  When telephony-based technologies are deployed: 1. The customer and order details are spoken by the customer to the agent. 2. The agent enters the customer and order details into a system. 3. The agent informs and transfers the customer (to keep their data secure) to an automated call- handling system (or IVR). 4. The agent has the option to terminate the call whilst the customer progresses the transaction independently. The type and related scripting of the IVR system used will be different for each entity. Within the IVR journey the IVR then asks the customer to input their PAN and SAD using their telephone keypad. 5. The IVR application receives confirmation that the payment is authorized and communicates that, or any other outcome returned from the PSP, back to the customer. An option to return to the agent may be implemented.  When digital technologies are deployed: 1. The customer and order details are spoken by the customer to the agent. 2. The agent enters the customer and order details into a system. 3. The agent initiates the digital application and sends the customer a link to a

Data Requirement 3: Protect stored cardholder data. Requirement 4: Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks. ▪ Where are the known data storage locations? Where are data centers located? ▪ Which legal jurisdiction(s) applies to Customer data? ▪ Does the Provider have any business, legal or regulatory requirements that could affect retention of Customer data? ▪ How is access to Customer data restricted to only that Customer’s users and applications? ▪ How are VM images, snapshots and backups managed to prevent unnecessary capture of sensitive data? ▪ How is data securely deleted from memory and stored images? Will data remnants exist in terminated VMs? ▪ If cryptographic keys are provided by Provider, are unique keys generated for each Customer? ▪ Where are encryption/decryption processes being performed? Who controls each process? ▪ Where are cryptographic keys stored, and who controls the keys? Are data-encryption keys stored and managed separately from the data they protect? ▪ Where is encrypted data stored, and who has access to the keys and encrypted data? ▪ How are security and access defined for the virtualized resources used for generation of cryptographic keys? ▪ What process is followed in the event of a suspected key compromise? ▪ Is all Customer data securely purged from all Provider systems upon termination of the agreement? ▪ How are communications secured between Customer and other environments? How are communications secured within the cloud itself? ▪ Are APIs configured to enforce strong cryptography and authentication? ▪ Is mutual authentication implemented between Provider and Customer systems?

Requirement 6: Develop and maintain secure systems and applications. ▪ Are VMs protected from within the VM or from the hypervisor? ▪ How is it ensured that VM images (including inactive and replicated VMs) have up-to-date anti-malware and patches before they are enabled for use? ▪ How are patches managed (e.g., prioritized, tested, approved and deployed), for both underlying Provider systems and provisioned Customer environments? o What is the process for each layer of the cloud servicee.g., physical network devices, firmware, host operating systems, hypervisors, virtualized components (including VMs, virtual network devices), applications, etc.? ▪ How are APIs and web services protected from vulnerabilities? ▪ Are standardized interfaces and coding languages used? ▪ How are development/test systems and data prevented from being inadvertently migrated into production environments, and vice versa (e.g., through virtual replication, imaging or snapshot mechanisms)?

Requirement 8: Identify and authenticate access to system components. Requirement 9: Restrict physical access to cardholder data. ▪ How is user authentication applied at different levels? ▪ How are layers of access controls managed to ensure that the aggregate access is not more than intended? ▪ Which Provider personnel have ability to access Customer data? ▪ How are Provider privilege assignments reviewed and monitored? ▪ How is segregation of duties maintained (for example, between administrative and auditing functions)? o Is administrative access to systems or hypervisor separate from access to Customer VMs and data stores? o Are separate credentials used for different security functions? ▪ How are least privilege and need to know determined for Provider personnel? ▪ How are credentials de-provisioned? o Does de-provisioning apply across all geographically distributed locations? o Could de-provisioned credentials be retained in offline images? ▪ Is remote access for Provider personnel permitted from untrusted networks? ▪ Are controls in place to prevent the capture of passwords in active memory, and to ensure that virtualized images do not contain authentication credentials? ▪ Is two-factor authentication required for Customer access? ▪ Does the Provider use any shared passwords (e.g., for maintenance)? ▪ Does the Provider maintain direct ownership and control over all data storage systems and facilities? ▪ Who has physical access to data centers and systems? ▪ How are data-storage systems protected from physical or direct console access? ▪ How are backups of VMs and data secured? ▪ How is physical media inventoried, secured, monitored, and tracked? ▪ Is media reused? How is data permanently removed from end-of-life or reusable media?

Requirement 11: Regularly test security systems and processes. ▪ How are activities traced back to individual Customer personnel or individual Provider personnel? ▪ Can the specific system components used by a Customer at a particular time be identified? ▪ What types of events are recorded in audit logs? ▪ How are audit logs correlated between Customer environments (such as a VM image) and Provider infrastructure (such

spacing, horizontal and vertical alignment, plus skew. Additionally, the characters must be printed with material of suitable magnetic strength, as measured by “signal strength” and the quality of the printing is specified by various tolerances. These specifications are detailed in sections 2.1.3 to 2.1.5 and 2.2.10. The MICR characters are contained in various “fields” which represent values for specific data strings. The data in these fields identifies such details as the Financial Institution, its branch and the number of the account to which the transaction is being processed. Details of the construction and positioning of these fields are contained in sections 3.1.1 to 3.1.7. 1.2 Definitions Aligning edge: The bottom edge of the document when its face is viewed. Amount field: The right-hand field of the MICR line. It is a fixed field that contains the value of the transaction and, if used, is normally completed by the collecting Financial Institution. Auxiliary Domestic field: For cheques this field contains the serial number of the cheque. When used with deposit forms, no pre-printing may occur as this is used to record the Item Count (number of cheques deposited) during the proofing process. Average edge: An imaginary line that divides irregularities on the edge of printed characters such that the sum of the inked areas on the non-inked side of the line equals the sum of the non-inked areas on the inked side. Used for defining both vertical and horizontal edges of printed MICR characters. Background: The basic colours and patterns that appear on a document, apart from lines and information printed on it. These must be printed in scan non-readable ink. BSB field: A field that contains symbols and numeric values identifying the Financial Institution and depending upon the individual Financial Institution, the State and Branch where the account is held or the processing centre and the State in which the processing centre is located or administration point of the Financial Institution. The symbol that opens the field (BSB symbol) is always the reference point for measuring character positions. Amended, effective 22/03/06 Capture: The gathering of data from the MICR line during processing, to enable further electronic processing of the captured information. Character space: The space in which one printed numeric character or symbol can appear. It is measured horizontally, from the right hand average edge of the character to the right-hand average edge of the adjacent character immediately to the left. There are eight character spaces per inch. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 9 AusPayNet September 2017 Cheque: A cheque is an unconditional order in writing that: (a) is addressed by a person to another person (being a Financial Institution); (b) is signed by the person giving it; and (c) requires the Financial Institution to pay on demand a sum certain in money. An instrument that does not comply with these rules or that orders any act to be done in addition to the payment of money, is not a cheque. Clear bands: Areas within which printing is restricted, these are the optical clear bands for Image Capture and the MICR clear band. Convenience amount: The Amount in Figures on cheques and the Total Amount on deposit forms. Deposit form: A deposit form is a summary of the cheques or cash being lodged to a specific account at a Financial Institution. Debossment: A physical impression of the typeface into the paper surface causing a depression below the surrounding paper surface. Designated peak(s): The peak or peaks of a waveform which is (are) used for the purpose of determining signal strength of a character/symbol. Document processing system: The series of processing steps performed on a cheque from initial lodgement through to return to the Financial Institution on which the cheque is drawn. Domestic Field: This field contains the account number of the document. The format is determined by the relevant Financial Institution. Embossment: As used in this specification, a physical buildup of toner on paper causing the characters to sit above the surrounding paper surface. Extra Auxiliary Domestic Field: Mainly used on deposit forms to identify depositors, hence the alternative name “Agent Number”. Extraneous ink: Magnetic ink, toner or other ink not intentionally printed which is located within the MICR clear band. E-13B: The designation given to the type of font used as the basis for the MICR system in the US, Canada, Australia and many other countries. Field: A sub-unit of the MICR line consisting of one or more MICR characters. Fields are either fixed format, such as the BSB and Amount field, or variable format such as the Domestic and Auxiliary Domestic fields. Image Capture: A process which captures a digital image of a document as it passes through a reader/sorter. This image may be used simply for storage and retrieval or for analysis by intelligent optical character recognition to read the written dollar value of the document. Leading edge: The right hand edge of a cheque when its face is viewed. It is used as the MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 10 AusPayNet September 2017 reference edge by mechanised reading equipment which reads the MICR code line from right to left. Magnetic ink/toner: The ink/toner used to print the E-13B code line. It is formulated by introducing iron oxide particles into the ink or toner materials, allowing the characters printed to be read by magnetic readers designed for this purpose.

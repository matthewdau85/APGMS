▪ Cloud Service Provider ("Provider"): It is the entity providing the cloud service. It acquires and manages the infrastructure required for providing the services, runs the cloud software that provides the services and delivers the cloud services through network access.2 ▪ Cloud Service Customer ("Customer"): The entity subscribing to a service provided by a Provider. May include merchants, service providers, payment processors and other entities utilizing cloud services. ▪ Cloud Service User: Person, or entity acting on his or her behalf, associated with a Customer that uses cloud services. Note: Examples of such entities include devices and applications.3 ▪ Multi-tenancy: Allocation of physical or virtual resources such that multiple cloud tenants and their computations and data are isolated from and inaccessible to one another.4 ▪ Cloud Tenant: One or more Customers sharing access to a set of physical and virtual resources. 2 Fang Liu, Jin Tong, Jian Mao, Robert Bohn, John Messina, Lee Badger, and Dawn Leaf, Cloud Computing Reference Architecture, NIST Special Publication 500-92 (Gaithersburg: National Institute of Standards and Technology, September 2011). https://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.500-292. 3 Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology  Cloud computing  Overview and vocabulary ISO/IEC 17788. http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html. 4 Ibid Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

It is therefore crucial that, prior to migrating payment card operations into a cloud environment, the Customer engage its technical, legal, due diligence, information security and compliance teams to work together to define its needs and evaluate potential cloud service offerings against those needs. Ensuring that cloud services are designed, maintained and used securely is a shared responsibility between the Provider and the Customer. It is important to note that all cloud services are not created equal. Clear policies and procedures should be agreed upon between the Customer and the Provider for all security requirements. Responsibilities for operation, management and reporting should be clearly defined and understood for each requirement and acknowledged, in writing, in contractual agreements. Regarding third-party or public clouds, Customers should consider that while they can outsource the day-to- day operational management of the data environment, they retain responsibility for the data they put in the cloud. Customers are encouraged to "shop around" until they find a Provider who can provide the level of security and assurance they require. The following steps should be followed by any organization looking to migrate to or evaluate cloud services: ▪ UNDERSTAND your risk and security requirements first. ▪ CHOOSE a deployment model that aligns with your and your industry's security and risk requirements. ▪ EVALUATE different service options. ▪ KNOW what you want from your Provider. ▪ COMPARE Providers and service offerings. ▪ ASK questions of the Provider and verify the responses; for example: o What does each service consist of exactly, and how is the service delivered? o What does the service provide with respect to security maintenance, PCI DSS compliance, segmentation and assurance, and for what is the Customer responsible? o How will the Provider provide ongoing evidence that security controls continue to be in place and are kept up to date? o What will the Provider commit to in writing? o Are other parties involved in the service delivery, security or support? ▪ DOCUMENT everything with your Provider in written agreements - for example, Service Level Agreements (SLAs)/Terms of Service contracts, etc. ▪ REQUEST written assurances that security controls will be in place, and periodic verification (e.g., compliance reports) that controls continue to be maintained. ▪ REVIEW the service and written agreements periodically to identify whether anything has changed.

Both parties should be willing to maintain open communication and monitoring to avoid any misunderstandings or gaps in security responsibilities. If account data is stored, processed or transmitted in a cloud environment, PCI DSS will apply to that environment, and compliance will typically involve validation of both the Provider’s environment and the Customer’s usage of that environment. Even though a Provider may claim to be PCI DSS compliant, the Customer should confirm that all the consumed services and locations were included in the Provider PCI DSS compliance validation, and that the services are used in a compliant manner. Moreover, the allocation of responsibility between Customer and Provider for managing security controls does not exempt a Customer from the responsibility of ensuring that their cardholder data (CHD) is properly secured according to applicable PCI DSS requirements. Customers should define what PCI DSS requirements are shared among the Customer, Provider and any intermediaries (e.g., a payment gateway) and confirm their compliance. Customers have final responsibility for security of their cardholder data.

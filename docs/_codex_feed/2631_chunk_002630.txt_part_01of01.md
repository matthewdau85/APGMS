(see 3.6.7, “Maintaining Evidence ,”) to demonstrate that the periodic PCI DSS scope review was conducted, as this may be required during the annual PCI DSS assessment. For more information, refer to the Information Supplement: Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation, which is intended to provide a further understanding of scoping and segmentation principles as applicable to the PCI DSS environment.11 3.6.2 Review of Compensating Controls PCI DSS requires that compensating controls are reviewed and validated by the assessor on an annual basis. The assessor is required to thoroughly evaluate compensating controls during each annual PCI DSS assessment to validate that each compensating control adequately addresses the risk the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to address. To maintain compliance, processes and controls must be in place to ensure compensating controls remain effective after the assessment is complete. The process should include a periodic: ▪ Review of the technical or business constraint precluding implementation of a security control documented in the original requirement. ▪ Identification of risk posed by the lack of the original control. This will require the organization to perform a periodic risk assessment to ensure up-to-date and accurate risk analysis. ▪ Evaluation of implemented compensating control to confirm it addresses both the objectives of the original control as well as any additional security weakness identified as part of the risk analysis. ▪ Collection and retention of evidence to demonstrate the implemented compensating controls are in place, effective, and operate as expected. 3.6.3 Automated Control Monitoring The use of automation in both security management and security-control monitoring can provide a tremendous benefit to organizations in terms of simplifying monitoring processes, enhancing continuous monitoring capabilities, and minimizing costs while improving the reliability of security controls and security-related information. Automated control monitoring could consist of simple scripts for monitoring system status or include large commercial products performing a variety of monitoring and alerting functions. The use of automation provides capabilities to assist security practitioners with recognizing patterns and relationships that may otherwise be difficult to detect 11 PCI Security Standards Council, Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation (PCI SSC, December 2016), https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Guidance-PCI-DSS-Scoping-and- Segmentation_v1.pdf.

Automated tools such as intrusion-detection, vulnerability-management, patch-management, asset-management, and configuration-management systems⎯many of which may be used as security controls themselves⎯also include status consoles, alerting mechanisms, and reporting engines that can be used to monitor the status and effectiveness of other security controls over time. The output from these tools can be used to generate evidence of compliance, on demand. For example, the output of automated vulnerability-management tools to satisfy internal vulnerability-scanning requirements (PCI DSS Requirement 11.2.1) can validate whether an automated patch-management solution is deploying critical security patches within the required 30-day window (PCI DSS Requirement 6.2) or when patching is performed at more frequent intervals (for example, weekly or daily). Another example is the use of file-integrity monitoring tools (PCI DSS Requirement 11.5) to confirm the effectiveness of change control procedures in PCI DSS 6.4.5. Specifically, unauthorized changes to critical systems or applications alerted by file integrity monitoring can be an indicator that change-control procedures are not functioning as intended. In software development, management tools such as Jenkins, GitLab, or others may include automation of various controls. For instance, if automated code review (PCI DSS Requirement 6.3.2) is built into the development process, reports from the management tools could be used to confirm the effectiveness and consistency of this control. A network security policy management system is another type of automated tool that can be used to review the rules of a variety of network devices including routers and firewalls across several data centers or sites, allowing a global view of all segments in scope. These tools often feature “out-of-the-box” PCI DSS compliance reports, which compare the rules and settings with specific requirements (e.g., detection of any to any rules, unused protocols, allowed insecure services, etc.) and can help detect violations of compliance. To identify suitable solutions, an entity can consult with its assessor or acquirer, as well as refer to industry publications (e.g., SC Magazine and Gartner). The use of automated security tools requires appropriate configuration, coverage (i.e., scope), as well as manual review and oversight to maximize their effectiveness. If individuals managing and operating these tools do not carry out their oversight responsibilities adequately, the value of such tools—and automation in general—is minimized. Further, violations in compliance may go undetected.

For many organizations, it may be impractical to manually collect and assess security-related information for every aspect of security controls deployed across an organization at all times. For example, it is ineffective to manually perform daily log reviews because it is time- consuming and prone to human error. A more practical approach is to rely on automation and establish

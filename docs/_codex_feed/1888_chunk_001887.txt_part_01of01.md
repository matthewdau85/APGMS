through processing. Finally, the fact that significant numbers of ASX Payment Providers are also already participating in the NPP, and NPP’s open access architecture, presents an opportunity to realise synergies between the two platforms. Corporate Actions – Electronic acceptance and payment of entitlement offers With its real-time payment and data rich capabilities, the NPP can be used by the ASX to deliver an automated electronic process for the acceptance and payment of entitlements, which will generate considerable operational improvements for the ASX and its stakeholders. Transactions can occur in a more timely manner (effectively with no settlement risk), reconciliation effort will be reduced and the quality of data will be enhanced. Interoperability between CHESS and NPP through ISO20022 messaging means detailed entitlement acceptance data can be passed across the infrastructure alongside the payment. This provides the holder’s settlement participant and the issuer with the ability to easily reconcile payment with the specific entitlement offer. NPP also offers the capability for payments to be addressed by a PayID such as an email address, ABN or Organisational identifier rather than using a BSB and Account number which could further improve the payment process for both shareholders and participants. The ability to enable acceptance and payment processing to occur any time of day, any time of the year, may also provide broader benefits across the securities ecosystem for issuers, participants and shareholders as well as other stakeholders such as custodians. For example, facilitating overseas sourced acceptances to meet a local record date processing cut-off. How it could work The diagram below illustrations how the entitlement payment process could work: Payment initiation messages could be sent from the ASX, containing holder details and data such as holder number, entitlement number, shares accepted, etc. These structured data elements are carried through into the clearing message or referenced via a url to an external data source Payments can be cleared and settled in close to real-time 24×7, 365 days of the year The Issuer would receive both the payment confirmation and customer investment data linked together The Issuer could pass on a corporate statement with investment confirmation NPPA would be happy to work with the ASX and its stakeholders to develop an automated electronic payment process to support entitlements. mFund – Sharing investor details, automation of regular payments and switching between funds As with the entitlement acceptance processing, the NPP can facilitate improvements to the manual processing issue for mFunds. With enhanced data capabilities and interoperability between the systems utilising ISO20022, as well as its real-time availability, the NPP can provide the benefits the ASX is seeking to deliver to mFunds customers and stakeholders. Future capability currently under development, including the ability to support recurring payments linked to a customer consent authorising those payments, could be used by the ASX to deliver a more streamlined and automated payment process. About the NPP The NPP was developed and funded collaboratively by thirteen Financial Institutions (ANZ, ASL, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, Citigroup, CBA, Cuscal, HSBC, Indue, ING, Macquarie Bank, NAB, RBA Banking and Westpac). NPP Australia Limited ( NPPA ) was formed in December 2014 to oversee the build, operation and management of the platform.

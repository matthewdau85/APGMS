(c) All Revocation appeal proceedings will be conducted in accordance with such procedures as PCI SSC may establish from time to time for the QPA Program, PCI SSC will review all relevant evidence submitted by QPA and each complainant (if any) in connection with therewith, and PCI SSC shall determine whether termination of QPA Program Qualification is warranted or, in the alternative, no action, or specified remedial actions shall be required. All determinations of PCI SSC regarding Revocation and any related termination or appeals shall be final and binding upon QPA. If PCI SSC determines that termination is warranted, then effective immediately and automatically upon such determination, QPA’s QPA Program Qualification and this Agreement shall terminate. If PCI SSC determines that such termination is not warranted, the Revocation shall be lifted, such Qualification shall be reinstated, and the listing of QPA that was removed from the QPA List as a result of such Revocation shall be reinstated. If PCI SSC determines that remedial action is required, PCI SSC shall notify QPA and may establish a date by which such remedial action must be completed; provided, however, that unless otherwise agreed by PCI SSC in writing the Revocation shall not be lifted, and QPA shall not be reinstated on the QPA List, unless and until such time as QPA has completed such remedial action; and provided, further, that if QPA fails to complete any required remedial actions by the date (if any) established by PCI SSC for completion thereof, PCI SSC may terminate QPA’s QPA Program Qualification and this Agreement, effective immediately as of or any time after such date.

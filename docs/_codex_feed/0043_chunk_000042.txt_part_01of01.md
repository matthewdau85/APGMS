This financial year, we saw payments evolve in ways that is accelerating change and likely to shape our industry for decades to come. Such rapid change can be overwhelming, but our industry has embraced the challenge. Highlights this year include: In collaboration with transport authorities, we developed a national Open Loop Transport Payments Framework. Ramping up the fight against online card fraud, our Accelerator event brought together the e-commerce community to tackle CNP fraud. We lodged submissions to Government to help shape the future of payments regulation. Supporting new technologies, we contributed to the development of local and international industry standards. We invite you to read our 2018 Annual Review below.

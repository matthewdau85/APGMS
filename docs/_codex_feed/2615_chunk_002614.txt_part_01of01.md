All rights reserved. Page 1 1 Introduction The PCI SSC Internal Security Assessor Program (ISA Program) provides an opportunity for employees of qualifying organizations to receive PCI DSS training and qualification to improve the organization’s understanding of the PCI DSS; facilitate the organization’s interactions with QSAs; enhance the quality, reliability, and consistency of the organization’s internal PCI DSS self- assessments; and support the consistent and proper application of PCI DSS measures and controls. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth in Section 4. The ISA Qualification Requirements document should be used with the following additional PCI SSC publications available through the Website:  Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures (defined in Section 4)  PCI SSC Code of Professional Responsibility 1.1 Qualification Process Overview This document describes the conditions under which an eligible organization or individual may qualify to participate in the ISA Program as a “Sponsor Company” or “ISA” (as applicable). The qualification process involves the following three primary steps (described further below): 1. Sponsor Company Qualification: The candidate organization must apply for qualification as a Sponsor Company. Applying for qualification requires submission of a complete Sponsor Company Application Package (defined in Section 1.2.1 below), including executed Sponsor Attestation. Sponsor Company qualification occurs once the above has been processed and the applicant has been notified by PCI SSC. 2. ISA Qualification: The process whereby employees of Sponsor Companies may be trained, tested, and ultimately qualified as PCI SSC-approved “Internal Security Assessors” or “ISAs.” ISA qualification registration on behalf of the ISA candidate is achieved by its supporting Sponsor Company employer (by submitting a training request through the Portal), payment of applicable ISA Program training fees by the Sponsor Company (see Website for ISA Program Fees), successful completion of ISA training and examinations, and the ISA candidate accepting the ISA Attestation through the Portal. 3. Annual Re-Qualification and Good Standing: To maintain “Good Standing,” a Sponsor Company must satisfy the requirements in Section 2.2, including but not limited to payment of applicable ISA training fees. To maintain “Good Standing,” an ISA must satisfy the requirements in Section 3.3, including but not limited to successful completion of all required ISA requalification training and exams.

Page 2 Note: Any full-time employee of a Sponsor Company may be qualified as an ISA by completing all required training and examinations successfully and by satisfying all other ISA requirements. Due to the technical nature of the training materials, and to increase the efficiency of ISA training sessions, PCI SSC generally recommends that ISA candidates possess the ISA experience described in Section 3.4. Individuals with significantly less experience or who are looking for a more general overview of the PCI DSS may wish to consider a different PCI SSC training program. ISA qualification signifies only that an individual has met all applicable ISA requirements as set forth in the ISA Qualification Requirements document, including successful completion of required ISA Program training and passing all required ISA Program examinations. ISA qualification may not entitle an ISA to perform special functions or conduct PCI DSS Assessments. ISA qualification is not transportable, and qualification as an ISA or Sponsor Company is not assignable or transferable. For the purposes of the ISA Program, an individual’s ISA qualification applies only for his or her Sponsor Company (and not for any other organization), and only while that individual remains employed by the Sponsor Company that employed him or her when initially qualified as an ISA

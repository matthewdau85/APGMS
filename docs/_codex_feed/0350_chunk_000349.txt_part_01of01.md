Infill Cheques Infill Cheques Infill Cheques Infill Cheques The areas in a cheque where the amount and payee are to be added are known as “in-fills”. In- fill may be completed by hand or by machine printing. If in-filling is printed by laser printer (or similar technology), then the level of toner adhesion, which determines the permanance of the printing, must be acceptable to the customer’s Financial Institution. (Inserted January 07) Care must be taken when infilling cheques, to deter fraudulent alteration and the likelihood of theft. Some points to note are: • Toners should fuse well with paper, making the characters difficult to remove • When using window-faced envelopes for mailing cheques, ensure that the window face and the envelope itself does not reveal the contents • If your design incorporates the use of boxes for the cheque amount, infill all of the boxes with “zero” to “nine”, or asterisks (‘***’) where it’s inappropriate to insert words • The Australia Post four state bar code is not compatible with the design and security requirements for cheques, and must not be printed on cheques. If you want to use the Guidelines for the Purchase and Use of Specially Printed Cheques P a g e | 5 bar code, you can print it on the accompanying remittance advice, cover letter, or envelope. Security and Control Procedures For your own protection, you should implement basic security measures associated with cheques, such as keeping blank cheques in safes or secure cabinets. For more information about cheque design, refer to “Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms” (Publication 11.5.2). (Amended December 05)

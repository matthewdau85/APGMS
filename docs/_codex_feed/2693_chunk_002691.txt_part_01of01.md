the third-party equipment resides on the entity’s premises, there may be a split PCI DSS responsibility between the entity and the service provider. The process used by the entity or a service provider to demonstrate compliance with PCI DSS, including for controls that rely on a third-party service provider, is discussed in detail in the Information Supplement: Third- Party Security Assurance.4 2.5 Systems and Networks Mistakenly Excluded from Scope Telephony environments are only as secure as their weakest link. Risks may not be considered when systems or networks are wrongly excluded from PCI DSS scope; this is often the result of two scenarios:  Improperly secured access from a third party or an application residing outside the CDE: Components that are often improperly secured include networks and systems not directly involved in the payment process, but that have connectivity to payment systems or the telephony environment where payment card data is stored, processed, or transmitted. Examples include corporate intranets, finance systems, human resource (HR) and other personnel-management systems, shared network directory serverspossibly the entire corporate network.  Inadequate segmentation and systems incorrectly considered to be out-of-scope: Any entity, system component, network, and third-party service provider with access to the CDE must be identified and that access must be secured with applicable PCI DSS controls. Alternatively, adequate segmentation must be implemented to avoid bringing other sections of the business into PCI DSS scope. Achieving viable network segmentation when a single VoIP phone system links in-scope and out-of-scope systems may prove very challenging. PCI SSC has published the Information Supplement: Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Segmentation. See Appendix G for a list of PCI DSS references and how to find them. Beyond the general scenarios above, the entity’s business continuity and recovery plan should be reviewed to assert if people, processes, and technology on the plan are in scope for PCI DSS. This is particularly relevant when offsite recovery facilities are involved whether they are hot, warm, or cold sites. 4 https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_V3.0_Third_Party_Security_Assurance.pdf Information Supplement • Protecting Telephone-Based Payment Card Data • November 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 16 2.6 Compliance validation Any entity operating a telephony environment for processing card-payment transactions should understand that while the PCI SSC manages the PCI DSS, card-payment brands and acquirers have their own compliance programs. Entities should understand their compliance-reporting obligations before conducting scoping activities by consulting with their acquirer or the payment brands to confirm their validation requirements. Once the need to validate compliance has been confirmed and the methods in which compliance must be validated (e.g., via SAQ or third-party assessment), the PCI DSS scoping exercise can begin.

Insider threat occurs when a person with legitimate access misuses his privileges and compromises the operations and security of a company… when an insider who has rightful access to the data is involved, it can often go undetected. There has been a steady rise in the number of cases of insiders’ threat related incidents in recent years.5 3.1 Risks and Guidance in Simple Telephone Environments The telephone environment, whether large or small, provides significant opportunities for payment card data to be compromised from outside the organization by criminals gaining access to systems and software. Compromises can also originate inside the organization from personnel who handle the calls or have access to systems and processes that support telephone-based payments. One of the best ways to mitigate that risk is to create and maintain a culture of security within the organization. In terms of people, the following should be highlighted:  All personnel having access to payment card data are in scope of PCI DSS and should be trained as per Requirements 12.6.1 and 12.6.2 and screened as detailed in Requirement 12.7.  As per Requirement 9.9.3, entities using points of interactions (POI) should provide training for personnel so they can identify and report any attempted tampering or suspicious behaviors.  A policy should be in place to ensure that payment card data is protected against unauthorized viewing, copying, or scanning, in particular on desks. Exposing personnel to spoken account data brings a number of risks to the organization that can be mitigated through adequate processes and technologies, but organizations should also be aware of the risk their staff face in being approached and threatened by organized crime. It is recommended that training should include awareness of those risks and understanding how the entity would support those personnel should that situation exist. 3.2 Additional Risks and Guidance in Complex Telephone Environments The key area of risk within complex telephone environments is personnel. This would include customer service representatives, the operators or agents that take account data and customer details over the phone, as well as their supervisors and managers. For example, front-line staff and their supervisors receiving account data through a headset or via a computer screen could use a variety of techniques to acquire and record this data, from simply writing the details into a book or mobile device to utilizing

PCI Security Standards Council, LLC 401 Edgewater Place, Suite 600 • Wakefield, MA USA 01880 www.pcisecuritystandards.org CASE STUDY PCI Corporate Training As a member of the PCI Security Standards Council Board of Advisors, BKM of Turkey is a significant stakeholder in the Turkish payments industry, aimed at improving the card payments system for all member banks with efficient, cost-effective and secure solutions. Founded in 1990, BKM’s core business is to operate a Message Switching System and perform clearing and settlement. Along with clearing and settlement, BKM sets and oversees application of domestic rules in the local market. The role of BKM both as a payment service provider and as a rule maker is a distinctive feature of the Turkish payment industry. BKM invited merchants to participate in a two-day Internal Security Assessor (ISA) training class held in Istanbul. Berna Sirel, Vice President – IT Security, Compliance, Risk & Quality, discusses the benefits of this educational event. Why did you choose to offer PCI SSC training to your merchants? There is still room for improvement in awareness and understanding of the PCI DSS across the globe. This is also applicable for Turkey – and the CEMEA region in general. Merchants need help in understanding what they need to do to secure their data and become compliant, so we decided to offer the Internal Security Assessor (ISA) training program to them. We chose the Council’s program because we feel that providing our merchants with direct access to the creators of the PCI Standard in this way provides them with insights unavailable anywhere else. What types of merchants attend the training? IT and security professionals from different industry sectors (insurance, e-commerce, retail, telecom, electronics) came together in this class. Security is different than marketing, sales, finance. If you work in marketing you don’t want to share your experience or your strategy with another person out of your company but security experience should be shared. This information sharing was achieved through the ISA classroom training. THE COMPANY Bankalararası Kart Merkezi A.Ş. (BKM) Nispetiye Cad. Akmerkez E3 Blok Kat:3,5 34337 Etiler İstanbul – TURKEY THE OBJECTIVE • For BKM to be a leader and role model for merchants in Turkey in terms of payment security. • To create awareness around payment card security in the region. • To enable Level-2 merchants to accurately and competently complete their Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ). THE STRATEGY We are endeavoring to increase the number of PCI DSS compliant merchants in Turkey. As part of this initiative, BKM initially provided SAQ consultancy services for level 2 merchants. The next logical step was to empower these merchants to confidently submit their own SAQs – and to facilitate that, BKM hosted an ISA training class delivered by PCI SSC’s expert instructors. THE RESULTS Through this one training event, 23 new ISAs have been qualified. Previously there was only 1 ISA in Turkey and while there is still work to do – this is a huge improvement. This was a huge leap forward for the CEMEA region. There has been an increase in the number of ISA companies in CEMEA in 2014 and 80% of this increase came from Turkey. Berna Sirel How does this training benefit your merchants? During the two-day class, merchants were able to share their experiences and create a “security network” to help make PCI DSS part of their business-as-usual practices. They got a clear understanding of the spirit and intent of the PCI requirements and had access to an expert industry instructor. Upon completion of the training, merchants know what is expected in terms of inspection, validation, documentation of each control, substantiation measures, and what is and is not acceptable for a given control. Merchants come away with a sense of clarity on the standards that they didn’t have before. How does this training benefit BKM? To be a role model for merchants, I personally attended this training and now I possess the ISA qualification in addition to being a member of the PCI SSC Board of Advisors. Merchant success in the PCI compliance arena is critical to BKM’s mission – so it is in our best interest to help merchants gain the necessary tools to accomplish that in their own organizations. With 20 new ISA companies coming out of this training class, this event was a huge success and something that we would like to repeat in the future. What feedback did you get from training attendees? We got an overwhelmingly positive response to this training class: • 100% of attendees felt the course was taught in an effective manner • Nearly 98% of attendees felt the training content was clearly presented • 95% would recommend the training to a colleague • The course materials and having access to the instructor were also cited as key reasons for overall satisfaction with the training class.

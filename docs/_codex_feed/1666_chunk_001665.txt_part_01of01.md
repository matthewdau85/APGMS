We oversee the Australian Paper Clearing System (APCS) for cheques. This system co-ordinates and facilitates the exchange and settlement of cheques and other paper-based payments between participants. We also maintain standards and specifications for MICR encoding and the design of cheque and deposit forms in consultation with APCS participants, equipment suppliers and the printing industry. These standards include security features, accreditation procedures and design specifications to reduce fraud, and assist processing accuracy and efficiency.

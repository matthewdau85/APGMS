Note: A list of pre-agreed Tier 2 Participants will be available from the AusPayNet Extranet site such that during a HVCS Fallback Period, it is clear that other Participants should not expect to receive payments from those on the list. HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 143 5.2.3 SWIFT Connectivity Participants must remain connected to the SWIFT PDS during the HVCS Fallback Period. That is, a Participant must not disable its connection to the SWIFT network via physical or logical means or deliberately undertake any action that would result in them being unable to send or receive payments via the SWIFT PDS. 5.3 Entering HVCS Fallback The key checkpoint times for declaring and entering a HVCS Fallback Period are set out in the RITS Outage Runsheet. In summary, where a Disabling Event prevents RITS from settling HVCS payments the priority is recovering RITS in order to resume normal system operations. As such, a decision to declare a HVCS Fallback Period is unlikely to be taken ahead of the checkpoint times outlined. However, if the RBA rule out a recovery of RITS ahead of the checkpoint times, then minimising the delay to payments becomes the priority and a HVCS Fallback Period could be declared earlier. If a Disabling Event occurs after 15:00, the RBA would not normally expect to declare a HVCS Fallback Period, but would assess the conditions and potential systemic impact on the day of the event. In all cases, a decision to declare a HVCS Fallback Period will not be taken within one hour of a Disabling Event occurring in order to allow for sufficient system investigation by the RBA. The following instructions apply once a HVCS Fallback Period has been declared. 5.3.1 Participant Preparation Time Participants should begin preparing for a potential HVCS Fallback Period when a Disabling Event occurs, but will be given a minimum lead time of 30 minutes from the decision to declare a HVCS Fallback Period to its implementation. AusPayNet or the RBA will instruct SWIFT to close the FIN-Copy Service and effect the change to T-Copy no earlier than 30 minutes from the time that the HVCS Fallback Period was declared to Participants. Transition to SWIFT T-Copy AusPayNet or the RBA inform SWIFT of the incident by phone call and foreshadow the impending action to change the SWIFT FIN-Copy Service from Y-Copy to T-Copy mode. The instruction is formally lodged with SWIFT using the SWIFT Secure Channel.471 Upon instruction, SWIFT commence the procedure to switch the FIN-Copy Service mode. Switching modes takes up to 45 minutes during which time the FIN-Copy Service will close for up to 15 minutes. The impact on payments during the transition to T-Copy is as follows: • Before: Payments sent before the SWIFT FIN-Copy Service closes, including those that were deferred in RITS or In-Flight when the Disabling Event began, will remain stored in the SWIFT FIN-Copy Service. When the SWIFT FIN-Copy Service closes, SWIFT will immediately forward the stored payments to the Receiver. The messages delivered to the Receiver will contain an empty PAC trailer in block 5 of the message and will not contain a Digital Certificate 2 from RITS. This indicates that the message was sent when the FIN-Copy Service was in Y-Copy mode, and has subsequently bypassed RITS due 471 Information available at https://www.swift.com/myswift/secure-channel HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 144 to the mode change. The Sender will not receive MT012 or MT019 responses for these payments. • During: Payments sent while the SWIFT FIN-Copy Service is temporarily in a closed state will receive a NAK from SWIFT with error code X09. The Sender can resend these payments when the SWIFT FIN-Copy Service reopens. • After: Payments sent after the SWIFT FIN-Copy Service reopens in T-Copy mode will immediately be forwarded to the Receiver by SWIFT. The messages delivered to the Receiver will not contain a Digital Certificate 2 from RITS. This indicates that the message was sent in T-Copy mode and has bypassed RITS.472 The Sender will not receive MT012 or MT019 responses for these payments. 5.3.2 Notifying Participants The RBA will notify Participants upon receiving confirmation from SWIFT that FIN-Copy Service mode has been changed. Service notifications will be sent to RITS Operational Contacts via email and SMS.473 5.3.3 Confirmation of ESA Balance If possible, the RBA will provide Participants with confirmation of their last known ESA balance prior to entering the HVCS Fallback Period. This may not be possible if the Disabling Event prevents the RBA from accessing this information, in which case, Participants must use their own internal records. 5.3.4 Payment Status Participants must use their internal system records to determine the status of payments sent prior to and during the HVCS Fallback Period. Note: As previously described, receipt of a MT012 or MT019 response from RITS indicates that a payment has been processed by RITS. Once the FIN-Copy Service has reopened in T-Copy mode, the absence of a MT012 or MT019 response from RITS indicates that a payment has bypassed RITS. For the avoidance of doubt, payments sent prior to the Disabling Event for which the Sender has received a MT012 or MT019 have been settled or rejected and their processing can

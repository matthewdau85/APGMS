Australian Payments Plus’ digital identity solution, ConnectID, is the first non-government operator of a digital identity exchange to successfully achieve the annual accreditation process under the Australia Government’s Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF), since officially being accredited in September 2021. Andrew Black, Managing Director ConnectID, said the accreditation marked a significant milestone for industry reinforcement on the robust safeguards that have been adopted in the ongoing development process for ConnectID. “ConnectID is delighted with the outcome of the accreditation process, reaffirming our highly trusted status. We have invested much time and effort in building a solution that not only safely and securely reduces the need for the oversharing of data but provides consumers with the ability to reuse their Digital ID - giving the individual more confidence and control of their own data,” Mr Black said. ConnectID acts as an exchange between identity providers - organisations that securely hold identity data on behalf of their customers - and merchants or government departments and other relying parties that need to verify who they are dealing with or receive identity information that they can trust. The accreditation doesn’t extend to other businesses within Australian Payments Plus. While ConnectID securely facilitates the identity verification or data exchange, it does not ever see or store the identity data. Identity providers store consumer identities and take responsibility for providing this secure information only under the consent of the identity owner. In this way, the identity owner – the consumer – controls who receives and uses their identity data. “ConnectID is aimed at creating ‘digital trust’ between customers and business and in the future will be able to seamlessly combine identity with payments transactions. Our successful annual accreditation is a key marker for industry adoption of digital identity to drive security and productivity in the digital economy and we look forward to continuing to work with the Digital Transformation Agency,” Mr Black continued. To date Australian Payments Plus has been working closely with all the four major banks who strongly support ConnectID. Additionally, work is underway with a number of businesses including insurance, ecommerce, real estate and employee verification. The TDIF sets standards, rules and guidelines for digital identity providers and is based on international best practice and industry standards. Organisations, government agencies and private-sector businesses like Australian Payments Plus and ConnectID can apply for TDIF accreditation and undergo a series of strict assurance evaluations.

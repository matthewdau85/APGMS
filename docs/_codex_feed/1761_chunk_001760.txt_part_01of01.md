At AP+, we are committed to fostering an inclusive and equitable workplace where all employees are valued and fairly compensated. We have made significant strides in closing the gender pay gap, and our ongoing efforts ensure that we remain at the forefront of pay equity within our industry. Our progress in gender pay equity Our latest Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) report demonstrates our continuous commitment to pay equity and the meaningful progress we have achieved: Average Total Remuneration Gender Pay Gap: Reduced to 1.6%, marking an 8.1% improvement from the previous year and significantly outperforming the industry midpoint of 25.6%. Median Gender Pay Gap: Currently at 8.7%, with continued focus on middle and senior management roles to further reduce disparities. Workforce Composition: Women make up 50% of Key Management Personnel (KMP), 45% of management roles, and 41% of non-management positions, a testament to our commitment to gender balance at all levels. Executive Leadership Team (ELT): Women represent 62.5% of our ELT, highlighting our commitment to strong leadership diversity. Parental Leave and Flexible Working: We provide paid parental leave with superannuation contributions, aligning with industry best practices. Our flexible working arrangements are widely adopted and actively tracked to ensure accessibility and effectiveness. Board Composition: Women represent 23% of our governing body. While this is below the recommended 40% target, we continue to advocate for increased gender diversity within the constraints of our our largely member-appointed board structure. Strong Results in Key Areas: We have achieved a negative gender pay gap in several departments (meaning women are on average paid more than men), including ELT, Legal, Risk, Finance, and People, Culture & Change, demonstrating our commitment to driving our leadership pipeline and fair compensation across diverse business functions. December 2024 quarterly gender pay gap update Fixed Remuneration Gender Pay Gap: Maintained at 2% overall, rising to 5.76% when excluding the Executive Leadership Team (ELT). Total Annual Remuneration Gender Pay Gap: At 2.19%, with a median of 9.15%. Excluding the ELT, the average gap is 6.28%, and the median is 10.09%. Workforce Composition: Women represent 42% of our total workforce and 45% of leadership roles. Departmental Pay Gaps: While gender pay gaps are neutral or even favoring women in areas such as the ELT, Legal, Risk, and People, Culture & Change departments, disparities persist in Open Payments, Identity, Commercial, and Technology. Addressing these gaps remains a priority. Key focus areas moving forward Despite our significant progress in closing the gap, we recognise that achieving complete pay equity requires continuous effort. We are committed to: Targeted Initiatives: Partnering with our Executive Leadership Team and Senior Leadership Group to address departments/hotspots with higher gender pay gaps. Refining Recruitment Practices: Enhancing our hiring processes to eliminate biases and promote equitable pay structures. Strategic Communication: Clearly articulating our long-term gender parity strategy, ensuring alignment with WGEA recommendations. Ongoing Monitoring and Transparency: Conducting regular gender pay gap analyses and reporting to leadership to drive informed decision-making. Leadership Accountability: Engaging our executive and governance teams to be champions of gender equity and hold ourselves accountable for continued progress. At AP+, we take pride in our advancements and remain dedicated to fostering a workplace where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. Our commitment to equity, transparency, and continuous improvement ensures that we stay ahead in building a more inclusive future for all employees.

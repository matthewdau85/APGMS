to address critical security controls while installing merchant payment systems. QIRs reduce merchant risk and mitigate the most common causes of payment data breaches by focusing on critical security controls. Check here to see whether the vendor is listed: List of PCI QIRs. 6. Regardless of whether the vendor is a QIR, if the vendor is installing a payment application or system, ask: • Does the vendor support me during installation and ensure installation is done securely? • Does the vendor provide an implementation guide to help me set up the application securely? Improper installation can make your system vulnerable to compromise. The vendor should either install the application or system in a secure manner or help you by providing you with implementation guidance. The implementation should cover, at a minimum, how to change default passwords and establish strong ones, how to manage patches and updates, and a description of how the vendor uses remote-access software to access your business (and what your role is with such software). More detail about each of these three areas is included at Questions 7-9 below. 6 Data Security Essentials for Small Merchants: Questions to Ask Your Vendors | August 2018 Copyright 2018 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved. Questions Ask: Analyzing Vendor Answers − Helpful Steps and Additional Information for Merchants Does the vendor help me securely install or set up the product or solution? 7. Does the vendor provide support during installation or set-up of the product/solution to help me change vendor-supplied default passwords? • Does the vendor help me set up strong passwords? Weak passwords and vendor-supplied default passwords comprise one of the three leading causes of merchant data breaches (the other two are covered at Questions 8 and 9 below). Vendor-supplied default passwords are those that come with a product or solution, such as the first-time password for a new system or application, a merchant hosted e-commerce website, or hotel booking application. These vendor-supplied default passwords are often simple and commonly known to hackers (like “admin,” “password,” or the vendor company or product name). These passwords should be changed to a strong password when the product is installed or set-up for the first time. If you change it to a simple password (like “12345”), it will make it easy for a hacker to get into your payment systems. If the vendor does not change default passwords when installing or setting up the application or system, they should provide you with implementation guidance that explains how to change these passwords and how to establish strong passwords. Does the vendor securely support and maintain the product/solution? 8. To understand patches (software security “fixes”) and updates for the product/solution, ask the vendor: • What support and guidance does the vendor provide to my business during the patching/ updating process? • Are patches and updates provided and installed automatically by the vendor? • Am I expected to obtain and install those patches/updates? • How does the vendor notify me when patches/ updates are available or have been automatically applied? • For hosted e-commerce websites, web applications, or payment applications, does the vendor take responsibility for patching/updating the solution they provide to me? Unpatched applications and systems comprise one of the three leading causes of merchant data breaches (the other two are covered at Questions 7 and 9). Unpatched systems often contain vulnerabilities that hackers use to gain access to your payment card data. The vendor should provide on-going maintenance and support for their applications or systems via software updates and security patches (software security “fixes”). For example, the vendor should send you patches when needed, notify you when they are available, and provide guidance about how to install them. It is in your best interest to have vendors/suppliers that fully support their products/solutions and either take responsibility for or assist you with patches and updates to ensure any changes keep your business secure. 7 Data Security Essentials for Small Merchants: Questions to Ask Your Vendors | August 2018 Copyright 2018 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved. Questions Ask: Analyzing Vendor Answers − Helpful Steps and Additional Information for Merchants Does the vendor securely support and maintain the product/solution? 9. Does the vendor require remote access into my payment application or system to support the vendor product or solution? • Does the vendor require remote access to be always active? • What steps does the vendor take to secure remote access? • Does the vendor use the same or a different password for each of their customers? Always available or “always on” remote access is one of the three leading causes of merchant breaches (the other two are at Questions 7 and 8 above). Remote access provides a path from outside a merchant network into the merchant network, which a hacker can easily use to compromise your system (or hosted system) and gain access to cardholder data. This can include remote access into a merchant network, used by the vendor to support a payment terminal or application, or to support a third-party hosted merchant environment or web application. To protect yourself, you should make sure that vendors help you by: • Limiting remote access to brief periodic use • Disabling remote access when it is not being used • Using multi-factor authentication (a way of verifying the identity of a person accessing a system using two or more factors, such as something they

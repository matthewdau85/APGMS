the facility (e.g., room) where the KGD/KID operates has sufficient supervision and controls to prevent any unauthorized access to that device that would allow alteration to that device or disclosure of any key or other sensitive data without detection; the KGD/KID is stored, under dual control, in a safe that cannot feasibly be penetrated without detection, and each incident of opening or closing the safe is recorded under dual control. 18 & 20 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 35 KIF Requirements Ref B.2.19 Any physical keys used to secure, unlock or operate a KGD/KID are carefully controlled, and available only to authorized persons. 22 B.2.20 The KID is used to inject a plaintext key into a cryptographic device only under the direct supervision of at least two authorized people, both of whom ensure that there is no “bug” or other disclosing mechanism on the path that the key traverses from the KID to the target device. 50 B.3 Procedures for Handling Target Devices The target devices referred to in this Part are either PEDs or Terminals. Requirements for Key Loading Devices (KLDs) which do not have key generation or PIN handling functionality are covered in clause B.4. It is important to ensure that no unauthorised access to the device remains undetected from the time of manufacture through to it being put into use.79 Prior to an initial key being loaded, the target devices require only tamper evidence because the device retains no information that, if revealed, could disclose any key that had been injected into the device prior to the compromise. Terminals or PEDs that have a public key (or key pair) installed as part of the manufacturing process shall be in a tamper responsive state once the public key (or key pair) has been installed. These keys may be for authenticating subsequent application loads and/or key loads.80 79 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 80 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 36 KIF Requirements Ref B.3.1 Keys shall not be installed in any SCD until it has been visually inspected by staff, who are trained to detect a non-authentic or tampered device, and a reasonable degree of assurance has been reached that the SCD is an authentic device and has not been subject to any unauthorised physical or logical modifications, or substitution. This assurance may take the form of, but not limited to, one or more of the following methods using appropriate guidelines provided by the supplier on how this is to be done: Physical inspection and/or testing of the equipment immediately prior to key loading; and Physical protection of the equipment (e.g., bonded carrier, device authentication code injected by Terminal vendor and verified on receipt, tamper evident packaging, etc.); The device is delivered with secret information to allow the KIF to ascertain that the device is genuine and not compromised providing the secret information has not been erased. 37 B.3.2 Any device, once it has been injected with keys, is controlled so as to prevent or detect unauthorized access to it, with records kept and audited so as to detect and report unauthorised substitution, theft or loss. 39 B.3.3 Controls are in place to ensure the destruction of any existing keys in a device returned to the KIF prior to the injection of new keys into that device. B.3.4 The distribution and loading of keys into a PED shall be performed under dual control using one of the following techniques: manual, e.g., key component entry via a key pad when device is in a sensitive state; or electronic direct loading, e.g., direct key injection via a cable from the originating device. 41 & 43 B.3.5 The action of loading a key puts the device in a mode that activates all tamper protection mechanisms within the device unless it is in that mode. 42 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 37 KIF Requirements Ref B.3.6 KIFs shall ensure that unique symmetric and/or private keys are loaded into each device. The same key(s) shall not be loaded into multiple devices. Public keys (certificates) may be common to a group of devices. 8 B.3.7 Where keys are derived for injection into various types of devices, the same key should not be derived for multiple devices, except by chance. 8 B.3.8 Controls are in place to detect the unauthorized replacement of a Terminal or PED previously removed from a facility.81 31 B.3.9 Upon inspection of a device, where there is any evidence of tampering or doubt about tampering, the acquirer shall be notified immediately. B.4 Key Loading (KLD) / Key Transport Devices (KTD) A KLD is an SCD used to load plain text keys into an SCD outside of the KIF, i.e., load keys into a PED in the field. A KTD is an SCD used to transfer keys between an SCD in the KIF and an external SCD. The keys may be moved in either direction. KIF Requirements Ref B.4.1 Keys shall not be installed in any KLD/KTD until it has been inspected by qualified staff and a reasonable degree of assurance has been reached that

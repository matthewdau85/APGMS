What are acceptable formats for truncation of primary account numbers? Acceptable truncation formats vary according to PAN length and Participating Payment Brand requirements. A maximum of the first 6 and last 4 digits of the PAN is the starting baseline for entities to retain after truncation, considering the business needs and purposes for which the PAN is used. When more digits of the PAN are necessary for business functions, entities should consult the table below for the acceptable formats for each Participating Payment Brand. PAN / BIN Length Payment Brand Acceptable PAN Truncation Formats 16-digit PAN (with either 6- or 8-digit BIN) Discover JCB Mastercard UnionPay Visa At least 4 digits removed. Maximum digits which may be retained: 'First 8, any other 4' 15-digit PAN American Express At least 5 digits removed. Maximum digits which may be retained: 'First 6, last 4' <15-digit PAN Discover Maximum digits which may be retained: 'First 6, any other 4' When using truncation formats for purposes other than storage, or for PAN lengths not covered within this FAQ, entities should confirm that their format is compatible with each of the applicable Participating Payment Brands.

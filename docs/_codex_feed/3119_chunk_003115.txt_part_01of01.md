PCI Security Standards Council, LLC 401 Edgewater Place, Suite 600 • Wakefield, MA USA 01880 www.pcisecuritystandards.org CASE STUDY PCI Corporate Group Training WPM Education is the UK’s leader in providing payment solutions to universities and colleges, through the WPM Payment Platform. This enables an organization to take card payments for anything from tuition fees, through to incidental charges and services. Over 150 organizations in the sector use WPM’s systems to improve customer service, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and grow their revenues. WPM helped create the sector’s PCI DSS SIG (Special Interest Group) following a need and opportunity for the wider sector to come together and pool their resources and efforts to find collective solutions to the challenges posed by PCI DSS specific to their types of organization. The PCI DSS SIG is comprised of circa 65 UK HE/FE institutions. Why did you choose to offer PCI SSC training to your members? WPM Education works closely with the UK universities’ and colleges’ PCI DSS SIG to provide them with foundation and practitioner level PCI DSS training. While this training is essential to providing a baseline of understanding around PCI DSS, and its application within a tertiary education organization, it can only go so far. WPM Education chose the PCI SSC to help provide the highest tier of training to the sector and ensure that organizations can support themselves better through having a qualified ISA. We received such positive feedback following our 2013 training; we decided to use the Council for our 2014 training also. Who attends the training? The organizations which attend this training are generally quite large and the need to address PCI DSS has a high priority for them. So the training is attended by one or two representatives from each member institution. The background of attendees is mixed; it can often be IT, Finance or from some type of audit function. What were the benefits to your members? The training provides institutions the opportunity to further build their internal PCI DSS expertise and strengthen their approach to payment data security, as well as increase their efficiency in compliance with the PCI Data Security Standards. And attending training with other institutions allows participants to share their experiences, discuss solutions and ask sector specific questions. The training also offers a valuable personal development opportunity to the members that partake. Becoming an ISA allows many institutions to tackle areas of PCI DSS compliance using internal resource, rather than always having to engage external consultants. THE COMPANY WPM Education 26 Victoria Way, Burgess Hill West Sussex, RH15 9NF, UK THE OBJECTIVE To help institutions to focus on achieving PCI DSS compliance as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. THE STRATEGY To offer Professional Development training to PCI Special Interest Group members that provide them with solutions to challenges specific to the higher education market - through hosting a PCI Council ISA training class delivered on site, by PCI SSC’s experienced instructors. THE RESULTS Over the past two years, students consistently rate the topics of scoping and testing procedures as most useful to them. In addition, the case study exercise as well as the real life scenarios presented during the class was also very valuable. Through this initiative 60 ISAs have been qualified in two years. In general, the course, venue, staff and trainers were excellent. I can’t think of any way that you could make it any better! I will definitely recommend the training to my colleagues in other universities. Thoroughly enjoyed the course. I have improved my knowledge and understanding The training covered all of the exam content well, and the training was very well informed Do you personalize this experience in any way? To help speed up the registration process, we have created a registration instruction manual which outlines how they can complete their ISA registration. To encourage training registrations we communicate the training offering via a number of marketing campaigns targeted at PCI SIG members but also to the wider sector as a whole (via client communications and publicised at our Payment Acceptance and Security Conference) We create a training registration webpage for members to subscribe to the training and send out a number of emails to registered delegates in the run up and post training. Have you done any surveys? How do attendees feel about the training experience? Feedback 2013: • Most attendees felt the content armed them with the information they needed to pass the exam. • Attendees left the training with increased confidence in their knowledge of PCI security and compliance. • 100% agreed that they felt more confident in their knowledge of PCI security following the training, able to apply the knowledge learned in the course and that they could help with PCI DSS compliance in their institution moving forward. • 92% agreed that they would like to develop further skills in this area. • 100% agreed the trainer was knowledgeable about the subject matter and that the trainer met the training objectives. Feedback 2014: • 100% agreed that the content was well organized and easy to follow and suited to their level of understanding. • 100% would recommend the training to others. • 100% found that the PCI Fundamentals pre-requisite course and test was worthwhile and the majority also agreed that they had sufficient time to complete the ISA examination. • 100% felt the quality of instruction was good. • 94% intend to renew their qualification.

The CVC1 and iCVV (or equivalent CSC) must be verified as correct for all transactions from 1 January 2026. Next page is Part 3 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 3 PIN USAGE OVER OPEN NETWORKS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 9 PIN USAGE OVER OPEN NETWORKS9 This Part 3 contains the principles and best practice recommendations as well as the minimum requirements for PIN usage in Issuer functionality offered over open networks which don’t employ SCDs for PIN entry. This includes, but is not limited to, PIN change and delivery mechanisms, internet banking registration systems, and other internet product offerings by an Issuer. (See also clause 2.6 of this Volume 2).10 Where the new PIN is derived or generated by the Issuer (Issuer assigned PIN), delivery to the Cardholder is supported using Internet based mechanisms (e.g., browser based PC or smartphone) or using SMS messaging based mechanisms. Where the new PIN is to be provided by the Cardholder (customer select PIN), only Internet based mechanisms are supported. 3.1 Minimum Requirements for Open Network PIN and PAN Functions11 Where an Issuer chooses to implement functionality, which involves open network transmission of the PIN, and where the principles and recommendations set out in clause 3.7 cannot be met, then: the requirements set out below must be followed: Concurrent existence of clear text PIN and PAN must be kept to the absolute minimum possible consistent with the functionality being implemented. Identification of the Cardholder must use additional identifying data other than that contained on or in the Card itself. Issuers must provide Cardholders with a means to determine that the dialogue with the Issuer is genuine. Issuers must use calling-line identification only as a confirmation, not proof, of a Cardholder’s identity, and must implement additional Cardholder authentication. Note: authentication via a mobile app on the phone and the phone itself are considered as different verification methods. All systems transporting PIN data or PAN data, or both, over open networks must provide mutual assurance to the Issuer and Cardholder that they are both genuine e.g. using a separate channel to deliver acknowledgements. Note: messaging via a mobile app on the phone and the phone itself are considered as different channels. All events involving the PIN or PAN, or both, back to the Cardholder must be acknowledged using an out-of-band mechanism i.e. through the use of two separate channels working simultaneously to 9 Amended effective 29/4/16, version 003 r&p 001.16 10 Last amended effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 11 Inserted effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 3 PIN USAGE OVER OPEN NETWORKS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 10 authenticate a Cardholder. Note: messaging via a mobile app on the phone and the phone itself are considered as different channels. Issues must provide Cardholders with the means to confirm the outcome of events involving a PIN or a PAN or both. Issuers must consider threats arising through device convergence resulting from technological change in selecting acceptable out-of- band mechanisms e.g. browser capable smartphones; and It is also strongly recommended that: The PIN should be encrypted immediately at the earliest point possible using an Issuer approved device. Identification of the Cardholder should occur prior to the entry of the PIN. 3.2 Recommendations for PIN and PAN registration systems over open networks12 Preferred model 13 Open network PIN and PAN registration systems leverage a customer’s PAN and associated PIN for one time user identification and authentication credentials. The following principles should be applied to any PIN and PAN customer registration system over open networks (e.g., Internet, mobile phone etc.): The PIN and PAN customer registration system for internet banking should protect the PIN at all times it traverses the Issuer’s system through strong encryption14. The PIN should be passed as an approved encrypted ISO format PIN block, either format 0 or 3, with format 3 preferred. Each PIN should be encrypted on the Cardholder's device to produce unique cipher text, (except by chance) to avoid the possibility of the construction of a rainbow15 table. Except for on the Cardholder's device all decryption, translation, and re- encryption of PINs should occur within an approved SCM/HSM. The Cardholder’s device should protect the PIN by forming an approved encrypted ISO format PIN block, either format 0, 3 or 4 immediately after PIN entry. 12 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 13 Inserted effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 14 E.g. TDEA (112 bits of security), AES (128 bits and higher), RSA (2048 bits and higher), ECC (160 bits and higher), and ElGamal (2048 bits and higher). See NIST Special Publication 800-57 Part 1 (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/) for guidance on cryptographic key strengths and algorithms. 15 A rainbow table is a pre-computed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, usually for cracking password hashes. IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 3 PIN USAGE OVER OPEN NETWORKS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 11 The registration system should re-encrypt the customer’s PIN block with a different PIN encrypting key as soon as it is received from the customer.16 In summary these principles are illustrated below.

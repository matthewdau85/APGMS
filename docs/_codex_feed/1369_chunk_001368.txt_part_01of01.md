Single Touch Payroll (STP) is a government initiative to streamline employer reporting obligations. Using STP, employers can report their employees’ salaries and wages, pay as you go (PAYG) withholding and super information to us from their payroll solution, at the same time they pay their employees. STP reporting started on 1 July 2018 for employers with 20 or more employees. It was extended to include small employers (with 19 or less employees) from 1 July 2019. Some exceptions may apply, for more information, see Single Touch Payroll on ato.gov.au. STP phase 2 The government announced in the 2019-20 Federal Budget that it would expand the data collected through Single Touch Payroll (STP) by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). The STP phase 2 changes are now law and are reflected in: Building on STP’s first phase of streamlining the way employers report payroll and superannuation information to the ATO, STP phase 2 will assist in the administration of social security for citizens in a more efficient, accurate and timely manner. This will be delivered through the new PAYEVNT.0004 2020 service. The technical service design artefacts for PAYEVNT.0004 (2020) (STP phase 2) are now available. Message Structure Tables and validation rules have been published on the Standard Business Reporting website and the service is available in our External Vendor Testing Environment (EVTE) and Production.

KiwiSaver Scheme Provider Accounts (KSPA) specification v1.0.0 Original Published Date 09/08/2022 - 9:48am Description The final Electronic reporting specification KiwiSaver Scheme Provider Accounts report specification v1.0.0 has been released. This specification is to be used in the development of software for receiving and lodgment of electronic versions of the KiwiSaver Scheme Provider Accounts (KSPA) verification and payment file in a Comma separated values (CSV) format, effective from November 2022. Eligible New Zealand residents will be able to claim their ATO-held USM directly from the ATO without needing to become a member of an Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) fund. The ATO will be able to reduce its USM credit balance and reunite individuals with their superannuation. The intent of the measure is to improve the operation of the Trans-Tasman retirement savings portability arrangement between Australia and New Zealand by allowing the ATO to directly transfer USM of New Zealand residents to KiwiSaver scheme providers. All versions No previous versions available. Last modified date 31 Aug 2022

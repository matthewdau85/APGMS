This is a critical artefact in order to understand the relationships of messages to services, formats and deployment platforms. PCN: Documents the contents of a service/suite package zip, the status of the artefacts, limited change history and key issues (essentially a high level release note). 1 3 4 MST(s): Defines the basic technical attributes and construct of a given message (contract schema). Relevant associated business data is also included to facilitate the end user to understand requirements at an elemental level. VR(s): Defines the validation rules for a given message (contract schema), along with links to error codes. These artefact s are a sub-set of the technical (XML) Message Repository - containing all messages for the ATO. These are linked to their corresponding technical rule implementations (Schematron and/or C#). Functional Design Build High Level Design Test Support 2 3 1 4 5 3 4 SBR ebMS3 WIG: Describes common technical components and services that are re- used by all business services, with messaging based on the ebMS3 standard and AS4 Conformance Profile. Provides guidance regarding the provision of taxpayer declarations in association with approved forms lodged to the ATO via SBR. It addresses the declaration to be given by the taxpayer to their tax agent prior to the Tax agents' submission of the approved form to the ATO. cBIG and TP Guide Forms part of the broader suite of documents used by the ATO to describe the business context and client usage of the web services offered by the ATO through the SBR platforms. SBR Core Services WIG: Describes common technical components and services that are re-used by all business services on this platform. Service BIG: Describes the business context and client usage of particular web services or a suite of services offered by the ATO through the SBR platforms. 2 SBR Core Services WSDL: Describes the service, the information exchanged and the technical protocols used for the exchange. SBR ebMS3 SDK Guide: Identifies the key components of the SDK solution. Some of these components are re-used from the previously released SBR Core Services SDK. For new components, this document will outline the usage details and the API specification (where applicable). 3 1 4 5 XBRL API: Provides functionality for creating, validating, and consuming XBRL business documents. Note: this API is no longer given DSPs who had not registered prior to June 2014. Sample contract schemas: Provided where test instances are in a later delivery cycle in order to show how an instance may look. 2 3 1 4 6 7 8 6 9 14 13 8 SSL Certificates: Contains SSL certificates that can be used for the various SBR environment endpoints. 14 Contract Schemas: Service/Suite specific schemas/message contracts in the formats of XBRL, XML or JSON. MR: Contains the majority of ATO response messages. Some services have response messages packaged separately and these can be found within the service zip package. Rules - Schematron: Provides the technical consumable VRs in Schematron for legacy implementations. Rules – C#: Provides the technical consumable VRs in C# for new implementations. 4 Artefacts and location: Contains links to artefact packages/documents and a short change description. Site and Document Maps: Contains site and document information. 3 Conformance PCN: Detailing artefacts within the package, their status, history and any known issues. Conformance Test Cases: Defines the test cases used to self-certify against for a given service. Test instances: Instance documents for use in self-certification testing. 2 1 3 4 Conformance Key Store: Containing credentials for a DSP to use when testing their product. 2 1 4 3 SBR Core Services SDK: Contains reference client showing how to call the Keystore and STS with a UI. SBR ebMS3 SDK: Contains reference client showing how to call the Keystore and STS (without a UI); the embeddable client which allows ebMS3 base communication. Release Plan: Provides a visual summary of expected services and environment deployment dates for a given period and release information. Pending! 2 ATO Service Characteristics Risk Chart: Describes the way in which the ATO classifies wholesale service actions and needs to be read in conjunction with the Service Registry. Service Versioning:Outlines the endorsed strategy for life cycle states of a service, principles for supporting versions and the decommissioning process. 1 2 Package Content Note (PCN) 2 ATO Taxonomy Architecture and Naming Conventions Message Structure Tables (MSTs) 3 Validation Rules (VRs) 4 Service Registry (SR) 1 Artefacts and Location 1 Site and document maps 2 5 Release Plan 5 Pending!

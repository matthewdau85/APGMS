(d) The period of permitted use in the IAC may be revoked by the Company as provided in the Device Approval Process and if revoked will be published in the revocation section of the AusPayNet-Approved Devices List. 3.4 Approval of Devices [Deleted]14 3.5 Approved Evaluation Facilities [Deleted]15 3.6 Evaluation Costs [Deleted]16 13 Inserted effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 14 Deleted effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 15 Deleted effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 16 Deleted effective 1/1/19, version 008 r&p 002.18 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 4 - DEVICE REQUIREMENTS AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT PART 4 CRYPTOGRAPHIC STANDARDS AND KEY MANAGEMENT Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 8 3.7 Agreements [Deleted]17 3.8 Evaluation Facility Accreditation Process [Deleted]18 Next page is Part 4 17 Deleted effective 1/1/19, version 008 r&p 002.18 18 Deleted effective 1/1/19, version 008 r&p 002.18 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 4 - DEVICE REQUIREMENTS AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT PART 4 CRYPTOGRAPHIC STANDARDS AND KEY MANAGEMENT Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 9 CRYPTOGRAPHIC STANDARDS AND KEY MANAGEMENT 4.1 Cryptographic Key Management – General Unless specifically detailed elsewhere, the following key management practices must apply. All cryptographic key management practices must conform to AS 2805.6.1. 4.2 Transport Keys 4.2.1 Approved Encryption Algorithms for Transport Keys DEA2 and DEA3 are the only approved algorithms for the protection of keys in transport. 4.2.2 Minimum Key Length for Transport Keys (a) DEA2 keys of less than 2048 bits are to be treated as single use keys and their use is deprecated. (b) DEA2 key lengths of less than 1024-bits are unsuitable for general use. Preferred DEA2 key lengths are equal to or greater than 2048 bits in length and should be used in all new implementations where hardware constraints do not exist. (c) Triple DES (DEA3) may use either 128-bit or 192-bit key sizes. 4.2.3 Key Life Cycle Practices for Transport Keys (a) DEA3 Key Transport Keys are single use keys only. (b) Symmetric Key Transport Keys must be freshly generated to protect keys in transport and then securely destroyed after use. (c) At the time of publication, DEA2 keys of size equal to or in excess of 2048 bits are deemed acceptable for a key change interval (life time) of

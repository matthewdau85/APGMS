the cooperation required between the public and private sectors to deliver the targets, not just within the G20 but beyond. The April edition of Cross-Border Payments Round-Up provides a summary of the FSB’s activities, responses to consultations and other actions being undertaken to support and successfully implement the roadmap and domestic cross-border payment priorities. The safety of mobile payments A Daily Mail article published last month warned Australians of “the dangers of saving their credit card details on their mobile phones so they have digital tap-and-go convenience”. In response to that article, we published a blog post that considered the purported dangers of mobile payments and demystified them, concluding that these payments are safe. AusPayNet remains committed to ensuring that end-users of the Australian payments system are well-informed about the safety and security of the payment options available to them. Stakeholder engagement update Stakeholder Advisory Council AusPayNet’s Stakeholder Advisory Council met for the eighth time in May. As a reminder, the Council acts as an advisor to our Board as we seek feedback from key stakeholders of the payments system who are not members of AusPayNet. We have welcomed two new stakeholder organisations: Consumer Action Law Centre (replacing Financial Rights Legal Centre) as one of our consumer advocacy stakeholders, and Victoria State Government. We now have Federal Government (Treasury) and state government representatives on the Council, with NSW Treasury acting as Victoria’s alternate. The Council discussed three main topics: Treasury’s regulatory reform agenda Our proposed Governance Model as an ASSB Our role as an insights body for the ecosystem (including stakeholders). As always, the feedback received was very valuable, and it will be shared at our next Board meeting. Cheques We recently held a member session on AusPayNet’s Customer-Led Decline of Cheques program. Almost 100 individuals from our member organisations attended the session that updated Members on the rate of decline of cheque usage, changes AusPayNet has made to its framework to enable choice, community outreach, and advocating for payment neutrality in legislation. AusPayNet Summit 2023 We are excited to announce that the AusPayNet Summit will return to International Convention Centre Sydney (ICC Sydney) on Tuesday, 12 December 2023.

web application (e.g., a SaaS application) that stores, processes, transmits or affects the security of cardholder data, the application should be either protected by a web application Firewall (or similar solution) or tested by the Provider, and this should be reflected on the Provider’s AOC and responsibility matrix. Providers that expose APIs to their Customers should also perform testing and reporting on those APIs. For applications that are supplied by the Customer (e.g., a microservice running on a PaaS or IaaS service), it is the Customer’s responsibility to perform the web application vulnerability security testing as a part of its PCI compliance program. Providers should recognize this requirement and support these required testing activities (e.g., by supporting the ability to disable controls that would impede controlled testing, by supporting applications that may perform these operations or offering a service to perform these services). 6.5.2 Network Vulnerability Scanning The Customer is responsible for ensuring that network vulnerability scans (PCI DSS Requirement 11.2) are performed in a compliant manner, although this requirement may be met by the Provider or another qualified third-party service. The entity that maintains the physical systems, networking devices, operating systems, and networked applications would generally be responsible for performing the scans necessary to ensure that these services are free from known vulnerabilities. For example, a Provider providing a SaaS service would generally be responsible for performing these scans and addressing the vulnerabilities found in the operating systems and applications it maintains. In PaaS and IaaS delivery models, there may be shared responsibility, as each entity must scan the devices, guest operating systems, hypervisors and applications for which it has responsibility. 6.5.2.1 Internal Network Vulnerability Scanning All connected systems or services within the CDE must be scanned for vulnerabilities from within the internal network on a quarterly basis, or when significant changes have been made to firewall rules or network topology (e.g., virtual networks, security groups, access control lists (ACLs)). This operation may require the initiation of a VM or application within the network to perform the scanning service, or the Provider may wish to offer a qualified scanning service to support these activities. 19 Penetration Test Guidance Special Interest Group and PCI Security Standards Council, Penetration Testing Guidance, (PCI SSC, September 2017), https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1.pdf. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 41 6.5.2.2 External Network Vulnerability Scanning All publicly addressable external IPs to the CDE must be scanned for vulnerabilities by an Authorized Scanning Vendor (ASV) on a quarterly basis, or when significant changes have been made to firewall rules or network topology (e.g., virtual networks, security groups, ACLs). Where virtual networks route across public IP space, these IP addresses must be included in this requirement, even if these IPs are considered private due to network controls (e.g., peering). 6.5.3 Penetration Testing To meet the intent of PCI DSS Requirement 11.3, penetration testing of the CDE should include both the infrastructure (virtual network, security group, ACL, guest OS and above) along with application penetration testing where applicable. 6.5.3.1 External Penetration Test Penetration testing activities from an external source must be initiated across the public untrusted network. If desired, these can be initiated from virtual instances hosted by the same Provider, but these systems should traverse the publicly routed IP space, and not have direct access to the CDE in order to ensure simulation of an external attack. 6.5.3.2 Internal Penetration Test Penetration testing from within the internal network should be conducted from network segments that have sufficient access to critical systems. This test should simulate an attack by an entity against internal infrastructure (where permitted by the Provider), where the attacker has already gained access to the internal virtual network. Depending on the architecture of the virtual network, as well as on the security controls implemented, the internal penetration test could be conducted from within the CDE or from other internal virtual network segments (e.g., management VLAN). 6.5.3.3 Segmentation Testing Testing segmentation (PCI DSS Requirement 11.3.4) in the cloud may be challenging, as numerous segmentation controls may be used to isolate systems, including ACLs, firewalls, Software Defined Networking (SDN) and network routing. In order to limit scope, penetration testing must be performed to test the suitability of these controls to confirm that the controls are operational and effective. Validation testing should include tests between VMs/instances, between applications/microservices hosted in separate virtual networks. The Provider should perform penetration testing as part of its own PCI DSS assessment to demonstrate separation of client networks, in order to aid Customers in meeting this requirement. These should include tests between Provider management nodes and Customer systems, and between Customers on shared infrastructure. This testing should be used to verify that adequate restrictive network controls are in place to segregate the environments (e.g., assessing the effectiveness of the restricted network controls implemented at the security groups/firewall or ACLs).

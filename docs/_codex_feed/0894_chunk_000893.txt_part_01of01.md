The TNA, which is to be approved in accordance with the relevant TNA Issuer's internal requirements, authorises processing of a File up to the value of a specified processing limit, limit frequency and period and guarantees payment of the drawing for the total value of such File plus any charges levied by the Lodgement FI, as applicable.320 A TNA Issuer may temporarily increase the authorised amount of a TNA, in order to accommodate certain extraordinary payments (eg Christmas payroll). A temporary increase of the authorised amount of the TNA should be approved by the TNA Issuer in accordance with its internal requirements and entered via BECS Connect. 321 A TNA or a notice of temporary increase in authorised amount is activated upon the Lodgement FI’s acknowledgement of it via BECS Connect.322 Subject to clause 6.10, where there is any change to the instructions contained in the original TNA, a replacement TNA must be prepared and authorised via BECS Connect.323 318 Last amended effective 16/9/19, version 062 r&p 002.19 319 Last amended effective 16/9/19, version 062 r&p 002.19 320 Last amended effective 16/9/19, version 062 r&p 002.19 321 Last amended effective 16/9/19, version 062 r&p 002.19 322 Last amended effective 16/9/19, version 062 r&p 002.19 323 Last amended effective 16/9/19, version 062 r&p 002.19 BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES PART 6: DIRECT CREDIT SYSTEM Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 63 A TNA may be terminated by the relevant TNA Issuer, by notice given via BECS Connect.

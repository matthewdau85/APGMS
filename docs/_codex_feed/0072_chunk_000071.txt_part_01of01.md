CEO’s Corner Modernising Australia’s Payments System It is now two months since the Government made its announcement on modernising Australia’s payment system. It is therefore timely to review progress since our initial response . We do so by looking at the two consultations launched as part of that announcement, before concluding with some comments on three elements of Government’s Strategic Plan for Australia’s Payments System . Consultation on Reforms to the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998 (PSRA) The consultation proposes broadening the PSRA’s definitions of ‘payment system’ and ‘participant’. This is sensible to ensure that they capture all entities involved in the payments value chain. Developments in the Australian payments ecosystem over the past decade mean that the existing definitions no longer do so. This can create an uneven playing field between different providers of payment services, and undermine the RBA’s ability to respond to these developments. The consultation’s stated intention to retain the PSRA’s presumption in favour of self-regulation – for example, in the comment that, “being within scope of regulation does not mean a participant will be regulated … such a decision [to regulate] would typically only be made after considering whether non-regulatory solutions could address the relevant concerns” – is also sensible; it continues to serve Australia well. One idea AusPayNet raised in our submission to the consultation was whether, since the PSRA is the legislative foundation for the RBA’s powers on payments, Treasury could establish the RBA’s new powers to both develop common access requirements, and authorise and oversee industry standard-setting bodies as part of this review of the PSRA. Suitable caveats would be needed to link the exercise of these powers to the establishment of the PSP licensing framework. However, granting these powers now could enable some of the proposed rights and obligations associated with that framework to take effect as soon as it is established, rather than requiring an additional round of legislative amendments. Consultation on Licensing of Payment Service Providers (PSPs) – payment functions Similar to the point made above on the need for comprehensive definitions of ‘payment system’ and ‘participant’, a tailored licensing regime for all PSPs will help promote access and competition while appropriately controlling risk. Defining the payment functions that should be captured – the focus of this consultation – is a critical first step in establishing the foundations for this licensing framework. International experience shows that there are several ways of classifying the many different activities undertaken by PSPs. However, the proposed list of payment functions outlined in the consultation, including the high-level differentiation between stored-value facilities (SVFs) and payment facilitation services (PFSs) is a good approach, akin to best practice elsewhere (e.g. in Europe). In our submission, however, we suggest some amendments to the approach, as follows: Greater clarity for entities that are likely to fit into more than one functional category, such as payment system operators That the storage of payment and transaction data and the provision of security services do not appear to – but should – be captured within the proposed list of payment functions That while the consultation paper seeks feedback on whether PFSs that are not consumer-facing should be required to hold a licence, AusPayNet’s view is that all PSPs should be licensed, regardless of whether there is a direct consumer relationship or not. One of the stated objectives of the new licensing regime is to better align regulatory obligations to the level of risk posed by a PSP. AusPayNet’s preliminary view is that some level of tiering or gradation (of licences and/or obligations) is likely to be required to achieve the objective of balancing end-user and financial system protection with regulatory burden, and better aligning with the principle of ‘same risk, same rules’ regulation. The consultation also provides a useful high-level categorisation of the key risks associated with different payment functions. We suggested considering additional factors that may affect a PSP’s risk profile, such as scale, nature of business, customer base, transaction values and volumes, and enabling technology. We also suggested considering whether more detailed risk management requirements should apply to all PFSs, particularly around operational risk, as is the case in Canada, Singapore and the UK. A Strategic Plan for Australia’s Payments System In his presentation of the Strategic Plan, the Treasurer noted that “leaving cheques in the system is an increasingly costly way of servicing a declining fraction of payments” . He also noted that the “transition will be gradual, coordinated and inclusive” . This will start with a government consultation on the topic later in the year. Another priority outlined in the Strategic Plan was action on scams. Pleasingly, there has been real progress here, with the National Anti-Scam Centre (NASC) having launched on 1 July and immediately announced its first fusion cell, targeting investment scams. I am representing AusPayNet on the NASC’s Advisory Board. Finally, on cybersecurity, the Plan noted the need for an “uplift in system-wide security standards and practices relating to the security standards and encryption methods for card payment systems” and that, given this, “AusPayNet has commenced planning for an industry-wide program to migrate the Australian card payments system to the safer Advanced Encryption Standard” . This program is now in its mobilisation phase, which will continue until December 2024. This phase includes the preparatory activities to finalise the technical blueprint, testing strategy, and migration approach. top Update on payments reforms AusPayNet continues to engage with Government

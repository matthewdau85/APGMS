According to the 2025 Australian Payment Fraud Report , the total value of card fraud on Australian-issued cards increased by 20 per cent to $913 million in 2024, driven by an increase in overseas card-not-present (CNP) fraud. Overall, there was a 12 per cent year-on-year increase in the overall payment card fraud rate, from 70.2 cents per $1,000 spent in 2023 to 78.8 cents in 2024, also driven by the increase in overseas CNP fraud. Overseas CNP fraud increased by 25 per cent to $454 million in 2024 and occurred at a rate of $12.08 for every $1,000 spent. This rate of growth was well above the 15 per cent increase in spending overseas in the same period. In contrast, domestic CNP fraud increased by 11 per cent to $362 million, but this rate was slower than the 21 per cent increase in domestic card spending. The domestic CNP fraud rate declined to a record low of 97 cents per $1,000 spent in 2024. While only 3 per cent of the total card spend last year involved Australian cards used overseas, overseas CNP fraud accounted for 50 per cent of all card fraud and occurred at a rate more than 12 times that for the domestic equivalent.

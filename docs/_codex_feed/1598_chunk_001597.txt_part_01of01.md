The machine credential (M2M) renewal FAQs in Online services for DSPs provides information to help you integrate this into your software. If a renewal function is not available in your software, a new machine credential will need to be created using the same name as the existing one. To create a machine credential, follow the step-by-step instructions on how to install a machine credential in RAM. To ensure continued access: the new machine credential should be created before the existing one expires Note: If the new machine credential is on a different device and is given the same name as the first machine credential, then the 2 machine credential’s exist on both machines, both with the same name, but with different serial numbers. Both will display in RAM and the unused credential should be revoked ) cloud software developers need to create the new machine credential locally hosted or desktop software users need to create the new machine credential. You can check the expiry date of a machine credential in RAM. It is best practice to revoke any unused, unassigned or duplicate credentials that are not required. Additional information for Cloud software providers using the CAA model As a Cloud Software Provider (CSP) you need to create a machine credential in RAM and update the authentication service endpoint as documented in ATO SBR Physical End Points (DOCX, 286KB) . Once a machine credential has been created, downloaded and installed, you will need to 'prime' your credential for use with SBR. You are not required to do this if you are renewing the credential. The first time you send a message to SBR your machine credential appears in Access Manager. While a machine credential is created with full permissions by default, you still need to login to Access Manager. Select the machine credential for use in the hosted SBR services you provide. When this has been completed you are ready to transact with SBR. What your users need to know Information and advice you provide your users will vary depending on their technical knowledge. Your users need to: set up their myID and link their business in RAM to access government online services such as Access Manager and Online services for agents notify the ATO that they are using cloud hosted software by recording their Software ID provided by the DSP, in Access Manager they don’t need to install a machine credential. See also Additional information for Sending Service Providers (SSP) or Gateway providers If you are an SSP or Gateway provider, your processes are closely related to a Cloud Software Provider (CSP) for installing machine credentials. If your implementation does not fit the model described under CSP, contact us for assistance via Online services for DSPs . Additional information for Desktop software providers Desktop software users may need to use RAM to create and install a machine credential on their device. Not all desktop software users need a machine credential. If your users transact with the ATO through a Gateway, or Sending Service Provider they will sign transactions on your users’ behalf. If your users hold business appointments within Access Manager to report on behalf of other businesses, these permissions are not automatically applied to a new machine credential. Once they have used the credential for the first time, they will need to log in to Access Manager and assign the appropriate permissions to the credential. This will be necessary whenever a new machine credential is installed. What your users need to know The information and advice you give to your users will vary depending on their technical knowledge and whether they regularly transact with the ATO using a Sending Service Provider (SSP). Messages for your users may include: they need to set up their Digital ID, such as myID and link their business in RAM to access government online services such as Access Manager and Online services for agents add existing business appointments to their new machine credential. They need to check the details in Access Manager are correct after they send their first transaction. Additional information for Digital Service Providers and the Operational Security Framework (OSF) While the credential’s authentication service endpoint is defined in your software, your users also need a machine credential. Large businesses or entities using On-premise software Large entities may operate within private cloud-hosted software services, where the enterprise software provider host all or part of their software in the cloud. Where that tenancy remains under the control of the customer, this software is still considered to be ‘on-premise’. As a machine credential custodian, you can only upload your credential to a cloud tenancy that remains in the exclusive use and control of your company. Digital Service Provider and Operational Security Framework DSPs are required to undertake ATO’s DSP Operational Security Framework (OSF) to access ATOs Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and use their machine credential to sign transactions on behalf of their clients. The OSF is the ATO’s approach to recognise and respond to risks posed by exposure of ATO client data through APIs. What your users need to know The information and advice you give to your users will vary depending on their technical knowledge. If your users hold business appointments within Access Manager to report on behalf of other businesses, these permissions are not automatically applied to a machine credential. Once they have used the credential for the first time via an SBR transmission,

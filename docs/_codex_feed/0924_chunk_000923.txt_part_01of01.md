These requirements are set out in: • PART 10, clauses 10.10 to 10.13 of the BECS Procedures. Specifically, the Procedures documents require each Tier 1 Framework Participant to test its contingency exchange arrangement: • with a minimum of one other Tier 1 Framework Participant, • at least once each calendar half year, over a period of time that is no more than four calendar years apart, • using live data, and data received must be used to process actual live transactions, • either in accordance with the timeframes specified in the Contingency Exchange Testing Schedule, or during management of a production issue in the 12 month period before the end of the Testing Schedule period. Tests to be done each calendar half year should be with partners, to be arranged bilaterally. Framework Participants choosing to use physical medium for contingency exchange must test each bilateral arrangement at least once every calendar half year, until such physical medium is replaced with alternate electronic communication. After every test of contingency exchange arrangements, each Tier 1 Framework Participant is required to: • provide AusPayNet with a signed Contingency Procedures Testing Certificate; and • confirm that you have reviewed the contact details held on AusPayNet's Email File Exchange Contacts Database.

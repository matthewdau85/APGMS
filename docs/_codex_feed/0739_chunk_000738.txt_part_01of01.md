to be ported, which can be defined by the Schemes to support their Token Migration Services. These services are expected to facilitate the porting of TPANs when the FPAN is no longer held by a PSP. It is noted that the FPAN is only a mandatory field if it is held by the Sending Party. If it has been deleted and replaced by Scheme Tokens, those Tokens should be migrated using the processes defined by the relevant Scheme. How Scheme Tokens are considered by the Standard The Standard does not aim to define how Tokens are used within the broader payments ecosystem, nor does it impose a uniform approach to tokenisation across the different Scheme Token providers. Instead, its purpose is to support the transfer of Scheme Token-related information that may be required by the merchant’s new PSP. Such information becomes relevant where the original FPAN has been replaced by a Scheme Token, and the original FPAN is no longer available. In these cases, the corresponding Scheme Token-related information must be included in the data transfer. Since the scheme token-related information may differ by Scheme, the Standard accommodates this by providing placeholders in the data elements to be ported. Each Scheme is responsible for defining and communicating the required data points and the intended use of these placeholder data items to the Primary Parties involved in the transfer. By providing placeholders for data to be defined by each Scheme, rather than detailing these in the Standard, the Standard aims to mitigate future changes to the data elements the Schemes require to be transferred, and the Standard becoming out-of-sync with these changes. AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS NETWORK 6 Data Elements - Schema design key notes • The data structure in the JSON Schema, outlined in Annexure A of the Standard, consists of three distinct, independent entries: merchant records, customer records, and credential records. Each entry is optional, but they include ‘child’ relationship attributes for association where applicable, allowing the Receiving Party to use these associations. This structure is designed to accommodate the different approaches that may be used by the entity holding the data. For example, a file could contain only the ‘credentials’ data type without any CustomerID/MerchantID fields, or it could include a single MerchantID entry with associated credentials. Alternatively, it could feature a more complex structure with multiple merchants, each with their own customer set, and each customer having multiple credentials. • The Standard does not state the “additionalProperties = false” rule, allowing for additional customisation. This enables the base schema to be extended through bilateral agreement to include any additional data points that are mutually agreed by the Primary Parties. • Validation has been applied against the FPAN/FPANExpiryMM/FPANExpiryYY fields only, as the other data points are either free-form strings, or are of formats which may vary between organisations, and are thus unable to be standardised. • The only required parameter for a credential is the CredentialID, which is most likely to be the PSP’s internal unique identifier field. The FPAN, FPANExpiryMM and FPANExpiryYY fields were not made mandatory, to future-proof the standard, allowing for the potential migration of a token using the SchemeCustomData sets. • In Table 1: Data Elements, the CustomerID is shown as mandatory if the CustomerID forms part of the primary key of the Sending Party’s credential data. This is to accommodate the different data structures used across the PSP ecosystem for those scenarios; in particular, where entities use a primary key which includes the CustomerID as part of that key structure. For example, if the Sending Party uses a key structure that includes both the CustomerID and CredentialID (e.g. for merchants, customers and multiple customer credentials) while the Receiving Party uses a simpler, credentials-only list with a unique key based on CredentialID alone, the CustomerID is required to allow the Receiving Party to reconstruct unique identifiers in their CredentialID fields. REQUIREMENT #2: DATA TRANSFER MECHANISM – DATA ENCRYPTION Clause 3.2.1 requires that the entire data file be encrypted using the OpenPGP standard. Currently, the Standard does not specify field-level encryption for data points such as PAN. A future version of the Standard may incorporate this requirement if this additional security is considered necessary. In the interim, Sending and Receiving Parties may agree to use file-level encryption by mutual agreement under the current version of the Standard. Clause 3.2.2 requires that the Sending and Receiving Parties must either verify Public Keys used for encryption before use or ensure that they have been received through a trusted communications mechanism. The purpose of this clause is to prevent malicious parties modifying the Public Keys during electronic transmission which would result in the malicious AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS NETWORK 7 party being able to decrypt the message. Many options exist for addressing this clause, including: • Send the Public Key to the recipient over email. Sender and receiver verify fingerprint of the Public Key via a phone call. • Convey the Public Key in an encrypted zip file using AES encryption and a password with a minimum length of 12 characters consisting of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. The password shall be transferred using an out-of-band communication channel. • The Public Key is stored on a thumb drive and couriered to the recipient using a tamper evident package. The serial number of the tamper evident package is conveyed to the recipient using a separate communication channel (e.g. email). • The Public Key

processes are critical to addressing these questions. Asset- management tools and processes must be able to identify and track all in-scope assets, including all hardware and software that make up each asset. Asset-management tools and processes must also be able to quickly identify when patches are made available to address vulnerabilities within that hardware and software. If such capabilities are provided through manual reviews or other manual methods, it is critical that these methods be performed as frequently as possible, so that the acquisition and application of security patches occur as quickly as possible to minimize the amount of time that unpatched vulnerabilities exist on systems. If EOL for in-scope assets is concerned, the EOL event should be planned for and managed well in advance of any defined deadlines. This includes making sure the entity is aware of any upcoming EOL events well in advance. Plan to begin replacing assets in sets over time prior to the EOL event, so that all assets can be replaced once the EOL deadline is reached. It is not a good practice to wait until the EOL event occurs, and then start thinking about upgrading. This approach runs the risk of systems falling out-of-compliance with PCI DSS. If an asset cannot be replaced prior to the deadline, the entity will want to identify all compensating controls and prepare all appropriate documentation to capture those compensating controls. If compensating controls are developed and used for an emergency EOL situation, do not assume they can remain that way long term. Part of the compensating control should be a clear plan to upgrade systems within a reasonable period of time. If an annual risk assessment is not tracking EOL status and identifying upcoming EOL systems as a risk, the organization may be non-compliant to PCI DSS, with no options for resolution until the asset or assets can be replaced. Given the potential costs associated with replacing expiring assets that reach their EOL, it is imperative that the identification and management of any EOL events be factored into the procurement and deployment planning for any new systems or assets. No systems or assets should be deployed without understanding when the asset or any of its subsidiary components are expected to reach their EOL, and then defining an approximate replacement schedule. Planning for an asset’s replacement at the time of initial deployment is likely far more cost-effective than waiting for an asset to reach EOL.

These laws and regulations may extend beyond the country where a business is registered and may be impacted by legislation that affects services providers. Guidance should be requested from regional legal representatives within organizations before making decisions of a legal nature that may affect your organization's compliance. Many regulatory entities, such as the State Regulators for Money Services Businesses in the United States and the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, can have a significant impact on the payment processing industry and may directly affect the compliance of an organization. Any legal exceptions incorporated into part of an ongoing PCI DSS validation process should be reviewed regularly, as laws and regulations often change. An organization’s legal representatives should ensure they are aware of all necessary resources to identify any new or updated legislation and regulations in all regions that the organization or a supporting service provider operates. 10.1 Non-financial Regulations In addition to the financial regulations governing financial transactions, there are numerous legislative factors to consider while implementing compliance standards across a distributed environment. Examples of non- financial legislation and regulations could include, but are not limited to:  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), European Union From May 2018, there is one set of data-protection rules for all companies operating in the European Union (EU), regardless of where the companies are based. This regulation applies to entities that process personal data of European Union citizens and residents. The scope of GDPR is more comprehensive than PCI DSS; however, if an organization processes cardholder data for an EU citizen, it is likely that the organization will be in scope for GDPR.  Federal Trade Commission, United States The Federal Trade Commission is the principal agency that enforces U.S. privacy policy. In addition, individual state law can require further considerations.  Equality Act, United Kingdom Legislation in the United Kingdom involving accessibility makes it illegal to discriminate against people with disabilities when providing a service in the public, private, and voluntary sectors. As a result, organizations can have a legal obligation to provide services to individuals with accessibility needs. Some technologies introduced for payment security may exclude these individuals, and alternative mechanisms may need to be considered when implementing such technologies. The relevance and applicability of non-financial legislation and regulations may depend on the industry, environment, jurisdiction, and other matters. Accordingly, guidance should be requested from appropriate legal representatives before making decisions.

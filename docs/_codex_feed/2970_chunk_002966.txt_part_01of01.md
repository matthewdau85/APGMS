Segmentation Challenges Segmentation in traditional hosted environments can be applied via separate physical servers and security measures applied using known methods. The difference in a cloud environment is that there are common shared layers (such as hypervisors and virtual infrastructure layers), which can present a single point of entry (or attack) for all systems above or below those shared layers. The security applied to these layers is therefore critical not only to the security of the individual environments they support, but also to ensure that segmentation is enforced between different cloud tenant environments.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 18 Once any layer of the cloud architecture is shared by CDE and non-CDE environments, segmentation becomes increasingly complex. This complexity is not limited to shared hypervisors; all layers of the infrastructure that could provide an entry point to a CDE must be included when verifying segmentation. In a private cloud environment, one approach that may help reduce the complexity of segmentation efforts could be to locate all CDE virtual components on a dedicated CDE hypervisor, and ensure that all non-CDE virtual components are located on separate hypervisors, adequately segmented from the CDE hypervisor. The need for adequate segmentation of Customer environments in a public or shared cloud is underscored by the principle that the other cloud tenant environments running on the same shared infrastructure are to be considered untrusted networks. The Customer has no way of confirming whether other cloud tenant environments are securely configured or patched appropriately to protect against attack, or that they are not already compromised or even designed to be malicious. This is particularly relevant where a Provider offers IaaS and PaaS services, as the individual Customers have greater control and management of their environments. 4.4.2 Segmentation Responsibilities Ultimately, the Provider needs to take ownership of the segmentation between Customers and verify that it is effective and provides adequate isolation between individual Customer environments, between Customer environments and the Provider’s own environment, and between client environments and other untrusted environments (such as the internet). Applicable PCI DSS controls for the segmentation functions would also be the Provider’s responsibility (for example, firewall rules, audit logging, documentation, reviews, etc.). The Customer is responsible for the proper configuration of any segmentation controls implemented within its own environment (for example, using virtual firewalls to separate in-scope VMs from out-of-scope VMs), and for ensuring that effective isolation is maintained between in-scope and out-of-scope components. The Provider should test and report security controls that isolate networks from each other according to PCI DSS Requirement 11.3.4. Customers wishing to implement segmentation within their cloud environments also need to consider how the Provider’s environment and processes may affect the effectiveness of the segmentation. For example, Provider systems could be providing connectivity between the Customer’s own VMs that is not visible to the Customer. Customers should also consider how the Provider manages offline or dormant VMs, and whether in-scope and out-of-scope VMs could potentially be stored together by the Provider without active segmentation controls. 4.4.3 Segmentation Technologies Traditional network segmentation technologies consist of hardware devices such as firewalls, switches, routers and so forth. These physical components could be used to separate VMs hosted on the same or multiple hypervisors, similar to the manner in which systems could be segmented in a physical network. This would require hypervisors with multiple network interfaces and with configurations that meet PCI DSS requirements for the various types of network hardware. Additionally, virtual counterparts of firewalls, switches and routers now exist and can be incorporated into a virtual environment. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 19 As mentioned above, a key consideration is how secure the common layers (such as hypervisors, container implementations and shared physical components) are, and to what extent they represent a potential attack surface between zones or Customers. Examples of controls to be considered when evaluating segmentation options include, but are not limited to: ▪ Firewalls and network segmentation at the infrastructure level ▪ Firewalls at the hypervisor and VM level ▪ VLAN tagging or zoning in addition to firewalls ▪ Software Defined Networks (see Section E.4, “Software Defined Networking,” for additional information) ▪ Intrusion prevention systems at the hypervisor level, VM level or both, to detect and block unwanted traffic ▪ Data-loss-prevention tools at the hypervisor level, VM level or both ▪ Controls to prevent out-of-band communications occurring via the underlying infrastructure ▪ Isolation of shared processes and resources from cloud tenant environments ▪ Container-based system isolation based on industry standard, vetted technologies ▪ Segmented data stores for each Customer ▪ Strong, two-factor authentication ▪ Separation of duties and administrative oversight ▪ Continuous logging and monitoring of perimeter traffic, and real-time response Segmentation controls should be tested annually (for merchants) or semiannually (for service Providers) to confirm the effectiveness of isolation between Customers in a multi-tenant cloud environment. The Information Supplement Penetration Testing Guidance provides further guidance on segmentation controls and testing principles.10 4.5 Scoping Considerations Merchants or other organizations looking to store, process or transmit payment card data in a cloud environment should clearly understand the impact that extending their CDE into

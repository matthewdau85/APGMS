and responsibilities for each requirement. Effective project management is critical to a successful transition. This includes maintaining accurate project plans, defining achievable and timely milestones, and continually tracking your progress. Finally, document everything. Establish policies and procedures to support ongoing and consistent implementation of security controls. There are also some new documentation requirements in PCI DSS v4.0 that you might need to address. Step #6: Use Trusted Partners It's essential to educate and train your staff about their role in keeping your data secure and meeting PCI DSS. Identify any skills gaps and train your teams in any new technologies you are implementing. This is especially true for small businesses, where every team member will need to be trained and made aware of their role in the transition. When implementing security controls, partner with a trusted security team. Utilize qualified professionals such as Payment Card Industry Professionals (PCIPs) , Internal Security Assessors (ISAs) and Qualified Security Assessors (QSAs) . These qualified individuals can support the consistent and proper application of PCI DSS controls. Use technologies and solutions that have been tested and validated against security standards for the protection of payment data. PCI SSC maintains listings of products and solutions validated to PCI SSC standards, including Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE) Solutions, Validated Payment Software, and Approved PTS Devices. Step #7: Do Your Own Assessments The best way to prepare for a PCI DSS assessment is to do your own assessments. Preparing for an assessment should begin as soon as possible; the more time invested in preparation, the more efficient and successful your assessment will be. Performing gap assessments early and often will help you identify the areas you need to work on. Early planning is key to being able to address any gaps before a formal validation is required. Regular testing will also confirm whether your new or updated security controls are implemented across all your in-scope systems and areas. Finally, it’s important to establish open lines of communication with the assessment team prior to the assessment. This can help ensure that all documentation is ready and that any questions are answered prior to the assessment taking place. Step #8: Prioritize Security as a Continuous Process PCI DSS v4.0 is designed to support long-term, continuous processes to protect payment data. The additional flexibility provided in PCI DSS v4.0 allows organizations to choose security controls most suited to their business and security needs. Organizations focused on maintaining PCI DSS security controls year-round can more readily avoid recurring cycles of short-term compliance followed by security lapses and short-term remediation each time they have an assessment. Regular staff training and awareness sessions should be conducted to help employees understand the importance of PCI DSS and the role they play in keeping the organization’s payment data secure. Building security into business-as-usual practices and engraining them as part of organizational culture will help ensure that, if control failures occur, it can be quickly detected, reported, and corrected. By focusing on security as a continuous process, organizations will have greater assurance in their PCI DSS v4.0 implementations and reduce the risk of security incidents and breaches.

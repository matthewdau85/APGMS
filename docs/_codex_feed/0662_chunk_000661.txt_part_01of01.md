Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 21 KEY INJECTION FACILITY REQUIREMENTS [Informative] This Annexure will be used by the company in carrying out an assessment of a Key Injection Facility as set out in clause 3.6 of this Code. It provides the assumptions, scope references and definitions in support of the Key Injection Facility Requirements provided in Annexure B. A.1 Assumptions As only AusPayNet approved SCDs are used for key handling, i.e., HSMs, KLDs and Terminals, it is assumed that these devices will only perform in their accredited manner. Therefore, no requirements have been included here that would have been checked during the SCD approval process (i.e., key lengths, algorithms, randomness and uniqueness of keys). This also applies to the tamper responsiveness of the PEDs after key injection.61 KLDs have their own set of requirements which will not need to be rechecked by the facility. This includes how the device is handled once it has been securely dispatched from the facility, i.e., requirements on how keys are transferred from the KLD into a Terminal.62 A.2 Scope The Key Injection Facility is considered to be the entire facility that is responsible for generation of the keys for injection into a PED through to loading of these keys into the PED. Annexure B, sets out the minimum requirements for protecting these keys; however it is understood that the environment in which the KIF operates may provide suitable mitigation in the event the requirements are not fully achieved. The scope of this part is limited to those requirements (both physical and operational) necessary for a KIF to meet. It covers: (i) the generation of the initial cleartext keys or key components to be loaded into a Terminal or a KLD (used to transfer keys from the KIF to a Terminal);63 (ii) the secure loading of cleartext keys or components into Terminals or KLDs within the KIF;64 (iii) the secure management of any key generation device, Terminals or KLD during the time it is under the control of the KIF;65 61 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 62 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 63 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 64 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 65 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE A. KEY INJECTION FACILITY REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 22 (iv) the loading of a keys, as part of the manufacturing process, which are subsequently used by the KIF; (v) key management between KIF and manufacturer, if required; (vi) key management between the KIF and acquirer, if required; and the secure receipt and dispatch of PEDs or KLDs to and from the KIF; and (vii) CAs and RAs which operate under a PKI scheme and may be used as part of a remote key initialisation scheme. The types of keys subject to the requirements outlined in this part are application-level keys used by, or injected by, the KIF into a Terminal as part of injection and initialisation process associated with the device. Such key types include:66 (i) Asymmetric initialisation master keys, such as manufacturer, sponsor, and TCU public & private keys; (ii) Symmetric initialisation master keys, such as manufacturer, sponsor, and TCU master and derived keys; (iii) the initial keys that the KIF is responsible for are any keys generated by the KIF, or received and managed by the KIF, which lead up to the establishment in the Terminal of the initial key common to the acquirer and Terminal.67 This part does not cover: (i) the manufacturing process of Terminals, including any loading of firmware etc. by the manufacturer, except where the manufacturer generates and loads a key as part of the manufacturing process. In the latter case, the manufacturer’s key injection facility must comply with these requirements;68 (ii) any subsequent storage or dispatch of the device by the manufacturer to the KIF; (iii) the manual loading of the initial keys into remote Terminals by a KLD;69 (iv) network or transport-layer keys, such as those used to provide full stream encipherment of traffic independent from the devices payment application (e.g., SSL/TLS, IPSec, etc.,), nor does it address any application signing keys used to secure the payment application on the device. 66 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 67 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 68 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 69 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE A. KEY INJECTION FACILITY REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 23 There are three phases for a device from manufacture through to installation for its intended use. The first is the manufacturing process itself. The first phase is not covered by these requirements. The second is the phase is post-manufacturing, from the time that the manufacturing process has been completed until the installation of the first key into the device. The third phase is pre-use, the period from the time the device is loaded with its initial key until it is installed for use. These requirements only cover the device from the post-manufacturing phase through to the pre-use phase when it is dispatched from the KIF plus any device returned from the field for reinjection. The intention of these requirements is to ensure that no Terminal goes into operation with compromised keys which could lead to

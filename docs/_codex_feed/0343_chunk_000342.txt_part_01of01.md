reference samples at a confidence level of 90% or greater (this is determined by the application of a statistical method known as the Student T test). - If the results indicate that the Printing System is capable of producing complying MICR encoding, then this will be advised to the Applicant and the Printing System will then be recorded in AusPayNet's Register of MICR Printing Systems. If an interested party enquires as to the status of a Printing System they will be advised as to:  whether the Printing System is recorded in AusPayNet’s Register of MICR Printing Systems; and  if the Printing System is recorded in AusPayNet’s Register of MICR Printing Systems, that accreditation is not a guarantee that compliance will always be achieved;  of any assumptions and qualifications that were made in the testing process; and  of the Tier 1A Participating Members that conducted the testing. 1.7 Re-test Amended, effective 22/03/06 If the Printing System fails to pass the required number of independent field tests during field testing, the Applicant is entitled to have that Printing System re-tested by the Tier 1A Participating Member(s) which did not pass the Printing System. No fee is charged in respect to this re-test. If the Printing System passes the re-test and meets the threshold stated in section 1.5 of this Appendix, the Printing System will be accredited and recorded in AusPayNet's Register of MICR Printing Systems. If the Printing System fails the re-test, in order for the Printing System to be re-considered for accreditation, the Applicant must lodge a fresh application with AusPayNet and pay an application fee in accordance with section 1.4.2 of this Appendix. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 69 AusPayNet September 2017 1.8 Other Accreditations Inserted, effective 15/09/06 AusPayNet may, in its absolute discretion, accept existing accreditations with other bodies as meeting part or all of the requirements of the accreditation process outlined above. 1.9 On-Going Evaluation Amended, effective 15/09/06 If an APCS Participating Member is of the view that an accredited Printing System is resulting in an unacceptable level of rejects, such that it is no longer clear that the Printing System is capable of producing MICR encoding of an acceptable standard, then that Member may nominate the Printing System for retesting in accordance with section 1.4.1 of this Appendix. AusPayNet will advise the Applicant of the request for a retest. The Applicant may then decide to:  seek to have its Printing System withdrawn from the Register (without a retest);  submit to the retest; or  make a submission to AusPayNet to oppose the request for a retest. If the Applicant submits to the retest the Applicant must pay a fee of $2,500 (subject to indexation in accordance with section 2.0 of this Appendix) to AusPayNet. This fee is intended to assist Tier 1A Participating Members nominated to conduct re-testing to recoup their costs for out of pocket expenses incurred in conducting those tests. Such fee will be applied by AusPayNet towards the payment of costs and expenses of AusPayNet which would otherwise be borne by Tier 1A Participating Members pursuant to APCS Regulation 6.11. The Printing System will be temporarily withdrawn from the Register for the duration of the testing process. The reason for the temporary withdrawal (ie re-testing in process) will be noted in the Register and advised to any interested party who makes an enquiry in relation to that Printing System. If the Printing System passes the retest, the Printing System will be reinstated on the Register and the fee charged for conducting the re-test will be refunded to the Applicant. If the Printing System does not pass the retest, the Printing System will be permanently withdrawn from the Register. The Applicant must advise owners of installed systems of the withdrawal of the Printing System from the Register. If the Applicant makes a submission to oppose the request for a retest, the APCS Participating Member that made the request, and any other interested party, may make submissions to AusPayNet in respect of the request. After consideration of the submissions put to it, with any interested APCS Framework Participants not to participate in the decision making process, AusPayNet will make a decision as to whether:  it is reasonably unclear as to whether the Printing System is capable of producing acceptable MICR encoding, in which case the Printing System should either be withdrawn from the register or re-tested in accordance with sections 1.4 and 1.5 of this Appendix. If the Applicant does not consent to the re-testing, the Printing System will be withdrawn from the Register; or MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 70 AusPayNet September 2017  it is reasonably clear that the Printing System is capable of producing acceptable MICR encoding, in which case the Printing System remains on the Register. Nothing in this Appendix 3 in any way changes the requirements for regular evaluation samples to be submitted to Tier 1A Participating Members. Those samples must be submitted in accordance with the requirements of this Publication, section 6. 2.0 Charges and Indexation of Fees Amended, effective 15/09/06 In addition to the application fee in section 1.4.2 and the re-testing fee in section 1.9, AusPayNet may charge the Applicant for the cost of providing any reference samples provided to them under section 1.5.1.3. The application fee payable under section 1.4.2 and the

risk-assessment areas and services that are being managed by third-party service providers with the mindset that in order to achieve and maintain compliance with PCI DSS, the organization and its third-party service providers must meet all applicable PCI DSS requirements. 3.5.1 Risk Assessments The requirement for annual risk assessments in PCI DSS Requirement 12.2 necessitates that organizations “implement a risk assessment process that is performed at least annually and upon significant changes to the environment; identifies critical assets, threats, and vulnerabilities; and results in a formal risk assessment.” Risk assessments provide valuable information to help organizations with determining whether or not additional controls may be necessary to protect sensitive data and other important business assets, and to better understand risks and their impact on key business objectives. The output Compliance with industry standards or regulations does not inherently equate to better security.

Organizations need to be diligent in performing risk assessments to maintain an effective PCI DSS compliance program. However, organizations generally seem to misunderstand the importance of a proper risk assessment. This requirement is among most often failed controls when assessing PCI DSS compliance.8 When conducted regularly and upon any significant change, risk assessments allow organizations to keep up to date with pertinent business-process changes and also provide mechanisms to evaluate those changes against the evolving threat landscape, emerging trends, and new technologies. Entities should perform a risk assessment as a pragmatic process when the potential for risk arises such as in the case of a data breach, a new technology implementation under consideration, or any significant change. The risk assessment process should be aligned with organizational vulnerability-management and change-management policies and procedures. The PCI Security Standards Council has published the Information Supplement PCI DSS Risk Assessment Guidelines, which provides further guidance on implementing a formal process to identify threats and vulnerabilities that could impact the security of cardholder data.9 3.5.2 Risk Assessment Frequency The frequency of the risk-assessment function is often a determining factor in how effectively an organization is able to respond to significant changes in business or technological processes. An effective means for conducting risk assessments, beyond the annual risk assessment required by PCI DSS, is to build risk analysis into daily activities (e.g., business engagements, change management, user management, etc.) that inform management when events exceed pre-defined risk tolerances. Similarly, risk-assessment discussions should be included as part of business planning, execution, and evaluation meetings. Incorporating risk analysis into operational-level activities enables risk assessment to become an integral part of a process rather than an additional overhead. Furthermore, continuous risk analysis enables organizations to respond more quickly to changing threats. 3.5.3 Using Risk to Balance Business Priorities with Security Needs In an age in which efficiency is considered a main goal, many organizations may find it is necessary to articulate the benefits of improved security in terms that business leaders understand. Unfortunately, most organizations continue to focus on security program cost reduction as the primary metric to define the effectiveness or success of an information security 8 Verizon, 2018 Payment Card Industry Compliance Report (Verizon, September 2018), https://enterprise.verizon.com/content/dam/resources/reports/2018/2018_payment_security_report_en_xg.pdf. 9 Risk Assessment Special Interest Group and PCI Security Standards Council, PCI DSS Risk Assessment Guidelines (PCI SSC, November 2012), https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_Risk_Assmt_Guidelines_v1.pdf.

Risk quantification is a much more effective measurement for describing how security efforts contribute to an organization’s bottom line. When risk is used to measure the impact that security efforts have on the achievement of the organization’s key business objectives, it becomes much easier for business leaders to understand how security expenditures provide value. Articulating security in terms of risk reduction, particularly over time, is a more useful method for illustrating the effectiveness of an organization’s information security program. Maintaining compliance with PCI DSS requires resources and financial investment. Using risk as the basis for measuring security effectiveness can make it easier for security teams to justify the expenditures necessary for building a comprehensive security and compliance program. 3.5.4 Standardized Control Frameworks The most successful organizations develop their security programs based on security principles in conjunction with a particular industry or regulatory mandate, such as the PCI DSS. They develop high-level security objectives and control activities designed to address risks to the organization’s IT infrastructure. These organizations then integrate specific compliance-mandated controls under the umbrella of the larger security control framework, enabling adjustments where necessary. Integrating PCI DSS controls into a larger, common set of security controls facilitates ongoing PCI DSS compliance. A single, comprehensive, security framework allows security teams to focus on a single target rather than trying to accommodate multiple (and

“ BPAY Group has been at the forefront of collaborative innovation within the Financial Services sector and beyond for decades. Our more recent recognition such as one of Australia’s Best Workplaces, AFRs Most Innovative Companies, Best Product Innovation is a clear strategic advantage for the Board of NewCo as it transforms into an entity that can literally take on the world, should the ACCC agree that this is in the public’s interest or otherwise approve it. ” NPP Australia CEO Adrian Lovney said: “ The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the pace in which the payments system is evolving. The increasing trends away from cash to online and in-app purchasing highlight how important it is for Australia’s domestic payments players to work together and invest in the current and future needs of Australians and how they want to pay. ” The new structure A single Board of 13 Directors will govern the operation of NewCo – comprising four independent Directors including the Chair and nine representatives from the major banks, smaller banks and nonADIs (such as retailers and other payment processors). Each Director will have one vote, the major banks will have 4 out of 13 votes. While arrangements could evolve over time with the approval of the shareholders, a key feature of the proposal is that the individual interests of the three entities will be protected. Fundamental decisions about the operation, funding, or future of any of the three schemes would be subject to determination by those shareholders that use that particular system. Retailers and other users of the eftpos system, for instance, will retain specific veto rights over any proposals that would directly impact eftpos. The proposal also requires that each organisation’s existing payments-related work program remains unchanged until at least June 2022. This includes: Extending eftpos acceptance online and in-app, and broadening of Beem It use cases; Development of QR codes in accordance with an agreed standard and in coordination with relevant entities; BPAY Group roadmap including making BPAY fully available through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and the further development of its Osko service; and NPP Australia’s Mandated Payments Service which will enable authorised third-party initiated debits from more than 72m Australian bank accounts via a single connection. A formal authorisation application will be filed with the ACCC in March 2021. The application will provide full details of the proposal and rationale. It will be made publicly available and subject to broad public consultation before the ACCC makes a determination within 90 days. Notes Current structure vs proposed new structure

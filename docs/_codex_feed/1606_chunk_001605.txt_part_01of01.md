wholesale services that use the SBR channel, can use the AUSkey Software Developer Kit (or ‘ADK’) to manage the keystore and generate security tokens using the M2M credential . The ADK includes licences that outline restrictions to the distribution, sub-licencing, modification, or derivation of the source code of the SDK or the Software. Cloud Software Authentication and Authorisation (CAA) Software products that do not utilise your client’s M2M credential (such as Software as a Service) must implement the Cloud Authentication and Authorisation (CAA) solution . In addition to a Product ID which identifies your product to the ATO, each subscription or instance of your software also needs an ID to validate the authorisation between the reporting party, the DSP and the ATO. A Software Subscription ID (SSID), commonly referred to as a Software ID, is a unique ID that is used to identify each unique subscription or instance of software. SSIDs must be kept confidential and secure to ensure they are used only for the purpose of transmitting data securely between the ATO and the product. You should refer to the Software developer information kit (PDF 979KB) for the relevant policies, conditions, requirements, and further information around the implementation and use of SSIDs. Marketing and communications This section outlines what is acceptable and unacceptable when promoting your products or services in connection with ATO digital wholesale services. Software tools that do not connect to ATO digital wholesale services and do not meet the applicable requirements, are not covered under this guidance. The ATO does not approve, accredit, or endorse specific products. Instead, we confirm compliance with the necessary requirements for using ATO digital wholesale services. Non-compliance with these requirements may result in a takedown notice being issued. Acceptable: Use approved terminology Accurately describe your product as being an 'ATO registered software product', or 'software registered with the ATO' after successfully completing the required ATO processes. Product register guidelines The ATO lists compliant products on the Product Register . You may provide a brief product description for inclusion, ensuring it adheres to these guidelines. Note that the ATO does not recommend, endorse, or validate the accuracy of listed product descriptions. Follow branding guidelines Ensure that the ATO’s copyright licence and Australian Government Branding Guidelines are followed. Provide clear messaging Ensure your communications make it clear that whitelisting or compliance indicates eligibility to use ATO services, not ATO endorsement. Unacceptable: Avoid misleading claims Do not claim that your product is 'ATO Approved,' 'ATO Accredited,' or 'ATO Endorsed'. Do not misuse branding Do not use the Australian Government logo, Commonwealth Coat of Arms , or other government insignia outside the approved guidelines. Refrain from overstating benefits Do not imply that your product's whitelisting status provides competitive advantages or guarantees of performance. Avoid misrepresentation Ensure that you do not misrepresent ATO’s role in your product’s development or functionality. For detailed guidance on branding usage, refer to the Australian Government Branding Guidelines , the Commonwealth Coat of Arms guidelines , and the ATO copyright licence linked above. Service specific terms and conditions You must be aware of the terms specific to the service/s you are consuming or intend to consume. Many of these can be found on the corresponding SBR and ATO API Portal pages for these services and the appropriate business implementation guides. Super services have additional legislation and terms you must be aware of.

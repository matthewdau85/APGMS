SenderID Register and AUSTRAC’s AML/CTF Rules. The 16th Economic Crime Forum, to be hosted by the Queensland Police Service on 19 August, will advance two critical public-private initiatives: the Money Mule National Week of Action with confirmed AUSTRAC partnership, and the Forfeiture of Unclaimed Proceeds of Crime project. eConveyancing Payments Industry Code Earlier this year, AusPayNet concluded consultations with the Australian Registrars National Electronic Conveyancing Council (ARNECC), the RBA, prospective members and other significant stakeholders on developments in the e-conveyancing ecosystem. Given these consultations and, in particular, ARNECC’s publication of the Model Operating Requirements v 7.1, our CEO determined as at 21 March that the e -Conveyancing Payments Code be stood up. Since then, we have officially launched the membership application process, receiving strong interest from both ELNOs and financial institutions, with a number of application processes currently underway. We expect to establish the Management Committee for this new framework in the coming months, with an inaugural meeting to be held before the end of the year. AusPayNet events AES Open Days Last month, we held our first AES Open Day that was well attended by our Issuers and Acquirers Community, and a second Open Day – in Melbourne – will be held this month. The Open Days have been designed to provide insights into current threats, how the rest of the world is addressing these, and an update on the progress of AusPayNet’s important work in coordinating Australia’s migration of the encryption on Australia’s card payments to AES. Melbourne Member event This month, we look forward to hosting our second in-person Member event at Square’s office in Melbourne. This will be a valuable opportunity for us to spend time with our Melbourne-based Members, while hearing an update on the Strategic Plan for Payments, regulatory reforms and technical payment standards.

The updated device standard supports the development of PCI Software-based PIN Entry on COTS (SPoC) Solutions for merchants that enable EMV® contact and contactless transactions with PIN entry on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices, such as tablets and smartphones. A summary of PCI PTS POI Modular Security Requirements version 5.1 updates are available here. Key changes include: • A new device approval class for Secure Card Reader-PIN (SCRP), a critical component in PCI SPoC Solutions as outlined in the PCI SPoC Security and Test Requirements. SCRP devices will be evaluated by PTS Laboratories in accordance with PCI PTS POI Modular Security Requirements version 5.1 and if compliant, approved by PCI SSC and listed on the PCI Approved PTS Device list. • Updated PCI PTS Device Testing and Approval Program Guide with a new reporting requirement for both Hardware Security Module (HSM) and POI vendors to report their compliance with PCI requirements for firmware maintenance and modifications, including open protocols. “The new Secure Card Reader-PIN (SCRP) approval class builds upon existing account data confidentiality requirements for Secure Card Readers and adds significant security enhancements to successfully manage PIN data security,” said PCI SSC Chief Technology Officer Troy Leach. “We now get the benefit of leveraging off-the-shelf devices with payment technology designed to keep account data encrypted and confidential throughout the transaction using industry-grade PIN key management.” Vendors can begin using PCI PTS POI Modular Security Requirements version 5.1 now for payment device evaluations. All new POI version 5 evaluations (including deltas of existing approved version 5 devices) must now use POI version 5.1. PCI SPoC Solution evaluations must include approved SCRP devices. More information on PCI SPoC Solution evaluations will be included in the PCI SPoC Solution validation program and documentation to be published in April. PTS POI Modular Security Requirements version 5.1 and supporting documentation including PCI PTS POI Modular Derived Test Requirements, PCI PTS POI Modular Vendor Questionnaire, PTS Device Testing and Approval Program Guide, and PTS Attestation of Validation are available in the PTS section of the Document Library on the PCI SSC website.

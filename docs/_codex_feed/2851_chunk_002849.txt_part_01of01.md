Where can I find the current version of PCI DSS? The current version of PCI DSS can be found in the PCI SSC Document Library. All retired versions are also available as archived documents in the Document Library. Compliance questions, including questions about whether it is acceptable to submit a PCI DSS assessment report for a retired version of that standard, should be directed organizations that manage compliance programs (for example, payment brands and acquirers). Contact details for the payment brands can be found in FAQ #1142: How do I contact the payment card brands? Also refer to the following related FAQs: October 2024 Article Number: 1328

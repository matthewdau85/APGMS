When a consumer pays with a multi-network debit (MND) card, the transaction can be processed on either eftpos or an international card network. Most merchants can enable Merchant Choice Routing (MCR), which allows transactions to be routed through their preferred network. This is typically on the lower cost debit network (also known as Least-cost Routing or LCR). If MCR is not enabled, the transaction is processed on the default card network, which may be more expensive for the merchant. Additionally, if a consumer explicitly selects an account (such as SAV or CHQ on a terminal), or card network (which is available in some digital wallets), the consumer’s choice overrides the merchant’s routing preference.

ways for entities to leverage the NPP's functionality. ADIs can participate in the NPP by becoming either an ‘NPP participant’ to directly clear and/or settle NPP payments or an ‘identified institution’ by forming an agency arrangement with a ‘sponsor participant’, who clears and/or settles the NPP payments on their behalf. There are already more than 55 banks, credit unions and building societies that are able to offer fast payments to their customers via agency arrangements through ADIs specialising in providing such services. These organisations or NPP participants who provide institutional banking services can also provide access to third parties other than ADIs, such as fintechs or corporates. NPP participants can choose to connect to the NPP Basic Infrastructure by either installing their own payment gateway, arranging to use another NPP participant's payment gateway, or using a third-party payment gateway provider. In future, other classes of organisations without ADI licences called ‘Connected Institutions’, which otherwise satisfy the required criteria, could obtain their own payment gateway and submit non-value messages such as payment initiation messages that are processed by NPP participants. Operating principles, risk and resilience The NPP and FSS have been designed to meet the demands of real-time payments and continuous operations, including high standards in relation to availability, capacity and security. The Reserve Bank is targeting an availability of 99.995 per cent for the FSS. To support 24/7 operation of the FSS, the Bank extended the operating hours of the RITS Help Desk to 24/7. The FSS is monitored continuously so that any system problems can be promptly identified and managed. The FSS is designed to allow planned maintenance and upgrades to be carried out while the system remains in operation through the use of isolated components that can be upgraded independently. The FSS can also be operated from two geographically remote sites, which is required to meet very high levels of availability. In the event of a more extreme disruption to the FSS, the NPP has contingency arrangements in place such that the NPP Basic Infrastructure can continue clearing payments for up to 12 hours without settlement, storing settlement requests until the FSS is available again. RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA BULLETIN – SEPTEMBER 2018 10 For the Australian payments system as a whole, the NPP will contribute to improved resilience by providing a new means of making retail payments. Further, since it is an RTGS system, the NPP can, if required, be used as an alternative to the traditional methods of making wholesale interbank payments through RITS. The NPP and FSS also change the risk profile faced by participants in the Australian payments system, by reducing the likelihood of delays in receiving funds but increasing the importance of real-time behaviour monitoring as there is no delay for the recipient of a fraudulent payment to access the proceeds. For further information about the resilience features of the NPP and FSS, as well as the risks and associated risk mitigants for NPP payments, refer to Box D: The New Payments Platform and Fast Settlement Service of the Bank's April 2018 Financial Stability Review. Activity Post Launch Since the public launch of the NPP involving around 50 institutions in February 2018, more than 65 banks, credit unions, building societies and other ADIs have rolled out services to their customers. In the initial weeks after launch, payment volumes were constrained to allow participating institutions to fine-tune their systems and operational processes. ADIs have also taken a staged approach in their roll-out strategy, gradually introducing services, channels and customer segments such as business and corporate customers. Reflecting these staged roll-out strategies, initial adoption of the NPP by customers has been gradual. It is also expected that it will take time for customers to evaluate the NPP capabilities offered by ADIs and modify their payment habits. Nonetheless, there has been sustained momentum: registration of PayIDs has been steadily increasing – especially as ADIs have opened up services to additional groups of their consumer, business and government customers – with over 1.9 million registrations as at the end of August. Likewise, use of the NPP has continued to rise since its public launch, with the FSS having settled a total of 19.4 million interbank transactions amounting to $15.1 billion as at the end of August (Graph 1); intrabank NPP transactions and transactions made between Identified Institutions that use the same Sponsor are not routed through the FSS. RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA BULLETIN – SEPTEMBER 2018 11 Graph 1 The daily value and volume of settlements through the FSS is in line with expected weekday variations, with a mid week peak and a weekend trough (Graph 2). For example, there is a peak in transactions on Wednesday and Thursday, which may be the result of consumers making more NPP payments on days they receive their salaries. Differences in consumer and business payment behaviour may also be influencing the intraday FSS settlement patterns (Graph 3). The value of FSS settlements is elevated on business days between 9 am to 5 pm, reflecting the higher values involved in business-related transactions, whereas the peak volume of payments is spread more widely through the day until around 9 pm, with evening payments presumably mostly reflecting consumers making lower-value payments. The uptick in values early in the morning represents some payments that have been instructed by customers days in advance, and scheduled by ADIs to occur at times when customers are less likely to

In general, it governs the manner in which phone calls are initiated, conducted, and torn down. SIP Acronym for “session initiation protocol.” A multimedia communications protocol used for controlling communication sessions, including voice and video calls over internet protocol (IP) networks. A SIPS (session initiation protocol secure) URI* can be used to specify that the resource be contacted securely. This means, in particular, that TLS is to be used between the user-agent client (UAC) and the domain that owns the URI. * URI: Acronym for uniform resource identifier. It is a string of characters to identify a resource. The syntax is defined by RFC 3986. A URL is a type of URI.

VoIP Acronym for “voice over internet protocol.” A method that enables use of Internet Protocol (IP) as the transmission medium for telephone calls by sending voice data in packets over IP networks. VoIP uses signaling protocols such as SIP (or SIPS) as a session initiation and session control, and real-time media and data transmission protocols such as RTP or SRTP. In addition, VoIP relies on various open-source and proprietary audio and video codecs that optimize the media stream based on application requirements and network bandwidth.

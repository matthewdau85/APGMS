AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS NETWORK 2 INTRODUCTION Payment gateway services provided by Payment Service Providers (PSPs) enable secure online transactions between merchants and their customers. These services connect a merchant’s website or application to their payment processing system through a secure online portal. A PSP that is PCI DSS1 compliant can store certain items of cardholder data on the merchant’s behalf. This prevents customers from having to re-enter their card details each time they make an online purchase with the merchant. A PSP may also tokenise the Funding Primary Account Number (FPAN) to protect sensitive data by replacing it with random, non-sensitive alphanumeric data, known as a Token. If intercepted by an unauthorised party, the tokenised PAN holds no exploitable value or meaning, as it can only be reversed (detokenised) to the original data by the tokenisation system that created it. There are two main types of payment Tokens: • Scheme Tokens are issued by the domestic and international payment networks / card schemes that are registered with EMVCo, and are for use across the entire payments ecosystem. These are also referred to as Network Tokens. • Proprietary Tokens are issued by either a merchant or the PSP that provides the merchant with the ability to process online payments. These Tokens are limited to the merchant and/or PSP ecosystem and are not used for sending card-related data to the card schemes. The ‘Standard for Payment Service Provider Porting of Merchant Payment-Related Data’ [Standard] was developed in consultation with industry stakeholders to address friction faced by merchants attempting to switch PSPs that hold their customers’ sensitive card data. In some cases, this friction can be significant enough to prevent switching (i.e. it prevents merchants from moving away from PSPs holding the Merchant Payment-Related (MPR) Data). 1. PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS NETWORK 3 PART 1 PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS Capitalised terms used in these Guidelines have the same meaning ascribed to them in the ‘Standard for Payment Service Provider Porting of Merchant Payment-Related Data’ [Standard]. INTERPRETATION These Guidelines should be read in conjunction with the Standard and are designed to help Applicable Entities interpret the Requirements and comply with them. If there are any inconsistencies between these Guidelines and the Standard, the Standard will take precedence. PART 2 PURPOSE, APPLICATION AND SCOPE PURPOSE In the RBA’s Issues paper on ‘The Australian Debit Card Market: Default Settings and Tokenisation’2 the RBA stated in Section 3.1 that it: “expects tokenisation to be implemented [for online payments], since it can substantially reduce the amount of sensitive card details being stored – sometimes with minimal security – across the payments ecosystem. However, it needs to be implemented in a way that does not impede the adoption of LCR 3 or competition in the acquiring market more generally.” The Payments System Board’s (PSB) May 2024 update reiterated the need to improve the security of card transactions in the online environment. Based on feedback from an industry working group convened by AusPayNet, the PSB decided to adjust and clarify the RBA’s tokenisation expectations4 for the industry. The PSB also endorsed AusPayNet undertaking further work to develop potential technical standards to support token portability. Expectation 4.ii of the RBA’s tokenisation expectations states that “Gateways should ensure that their proprietary tokens do not impede merchants switching payment service providers”. Expectation 4.iii states that ”Token-holding entities should provide, in a secure way, any reasonable data to any ‘authorised’ third-party required to support token migration, and token migration should be executed in a timely manner.” Supporting the industry to meet the RBA’s portability expectations, the Standard aims to reduce the friction that can impede a merchant switching PSPs. An incumbent PSP being unwilling to send or sending incomplete customer payment-related data to a merchant’s new PSP may result in the merchant needing to recollect sensitive card payment details from their customers, or an increase in payment declines. The Standard prescribes a set of requirements for the Porting of MPR Data that: • details the mandatory payment-related data to be Ported between the Sending and Receiving Parties; 2.

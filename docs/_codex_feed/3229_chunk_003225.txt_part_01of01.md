PCI Security Standards Council Bulletin: PCI SSC Impersonation, Phishing, and Know Your Customer (KYC) Scams 13 July 2023 The PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) has learned that one or more unauthorized third parties have been sending communications to or calling PCI stakeholders, including merchants, Community Meeting sponsors and exhibitors, and others, purportedly on behalf of PCI SSC, seeking to elicit financial or other sensitive information and/or potentially sell unauthorized services. Examples are shown below. To the extent these or similar communications purport to be from PCI SSC, they are phishing attempts and are illegal. Although these requests often appear to be from PCI SSC, and in some cases include PCI SSC marks, logos, or contact information, they are not from or endorsed by PCI SSC. These communications may take the following or other forms:  Emails requesting “Know Your Customer” (KYC) information, “Merchant Member Business Information”, or similar information.  Emails requesting routing numbers, account numbers, or other sensitive or financial data.  Email offers for event attendance lists, purporting to be from or associated with PCI SSC.  Calls from individuals claiming to be PCI SSC representatives offering various services. PCI SSC will never send industry stakeholders unsolicited requests for routing, account, or similar financial numbers, data, or information. Some communications have also been purported to be arranging hotel rooms for or providing information about the PCI Community Meetings. We do not work with non-affiliated parties to manage hotel room blocks for these events. Should you or one of your customers receive unsolicited or unexpected communications purporting to be from PCI SSC and requesting financial or other sensitive data, we strongly encourage you to promptly report the incident to the appropriate authorities in your region. To confirm information about PCI SSC Community Meetings and other PCI SSC events, all details are available on the Event page of the website. Questions about information received via email may be directed to pcicm@pcisecuritystandards.org. PCI SSC publishes resources on defending against common scams and threats.

Following de-whitelisting, if all appropriate actions are taken by the DSP to rectify the issues, re-whitelisting may be considered. For a DSP to be re-whitelisted the following must occur: • The DSP must provide the DPO written assurance and appropriate evidence that they have rectified the issue which was the cause of their de-whitelisting • The assurance and evidence will be assessed by the ATO and a decision will be made to accept/refuse the re-whitelisting request • Where applicable, the DSP must complete the latest Security Questionnaire to make sure that they have the right security posture. This includes compliance with any outstanding requirements under the DSP Operational Framework • Where required, the DSP may need to perform Production Verification Testing (PVT) of their product to ensure correct execution of their code. In some cases, an abbreviated PVT process can take place, however this will be determined on a case by case basis Notification of de-whitelisting Re-whitelisting - considerations ato.gov.au

AI agents’ effectiveness depends on the quality of data it consumes. Build a unified customer view by connecting and harmonizing data sources to establish a “single source of truth.” This foundation ensures AI models deliver relevant and actionable insights. Proactively Manage Risks Stay vigilant about risks—particularly around data privacy and security. Implement safeguards such as data masking for personally identifiable information (PII), monitor AI agents’ outputs for bias or inaccuracies, and maintain human oversight throughout. Integrate AI and Iterate Continuously Drive measurable business value by embedding AI insights into existing workflows. Continuously evaluate outcomes, refine models, and evolve strategies to optimize performance over time. What AI trend (not limited to payments) are you most excited about? The rise of agentic AI and its potential to deliver personalized customer experiences at scale, while simultaneously strengthening security and compliance. AI agents that not only understand customer needs but also take proactive actions—ranging from generating customized content to automating complex service requests—are truly game-changing. At Salesforce, Agentforce enables these digital agents to continuously monitor and evaluate our security posture. They process vast volumes of data in real time to detect anomalies, uncover vulnerabilities, and even simulate attack scenarios. This proactive, scalable approach allows us to identify and respond to threats faster than ever before. Moreover, agentic AI accelerates Salesforce’s ability to adapt to evolving regulatory landscapes by automating policy reviews, compliance checks, and ensuring strict adherence to standards like PCI. Ultimately, it’s about creating seamless, personalized interactions while maintaining a robust, secure, and compliant environment across all systems. Interested in learning more?

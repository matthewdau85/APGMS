add, extend, replace, or supersede PCI DSS requirements. The PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) is not responsible for enforcing compliance or determining whether a particular implementation is compliant. Entities and third-party service providers should work with their acquirers and/or payment card brands to understand their compliance- validation and reporting responsibilities. This document focuses exclusively on securing telephone-based payment card data including an entity’s transition to voice-over-IP (VoIP) based communications. This is particularly relevant for entities in locations where established national carriers have announced transition plans to move away from Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN) and public switched telephone networks (PSTN) toward the exclusive provision of VoIP services. Where possible, the document uses simple language and diagrams to explain the risks and vulnerabilities associated with telephone-based payment environments and provides guidance on how to secure them irrespective of the size or capabilities of the telephony environment. This document does not provide guidance on the types of technology that should be used to meet an entity’s business requirements. A quick guide to navigating the document is provided in Appendix B, “Document Quick-reference Guide.” 1.1 Objective This Information Supplement provides guidance for today’s telephone-payment environmentswhether merchant, service provider, or vendorto better manage the risk of fraudulent activity in this essential payment-service area. Written for a wide range of merchants, from small businesses to large contact centers, it allows the reader to understand the risks and security challenges associated to their telephone environment. This document also provides many hypothetical scenarios to help clarify how PCI DSS requirements can be applied to telephony technologies and to illustrate appropriate methods to address identified risks and challenges. 1.2 Audience This document provides guidance for entities of all sizes and complexity that store, process, or transmit account data over the telephone. It is assumed that the reader has a basic knowledge of or experience in telephony and payment systems. A glossary of terms is provided in Section 1.4 for readers with limited knowledge or experience in these domains. The intended audience includes, but is not limited to:  Entities, such as merchants, that use telephony as a card-acceptance payment channel.  Entities such as merchants, customer-service centers, call centers or contact centers that outsource or are considering outsourcing telephony payment acceptance to a third-party service provider. Information Supplement • Protecting Telephone-Based Payment Card Data • November 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 2  Service providers that accept payments over the telephone or manage transactions on behalf of merchants or other entities.  Technology vendors providing, maintaining, and/or managing telephone payment systems.  Providers of telephony servicese.g., interactive voice response (IVR) or Dual-Tone, Multi-Frequency (DTMF) masking/suppressing.  Qualified Security Assessors (QSA) and Internal Security Assessors (ISA) that support these entities.  Acquirers, payment service providers, and payment gateways that support relevant entities.  Card issuers that support the secure distribution of payment cards to cardholders. 1.3 Using the document This document covers the fundamental principles associated with applying PCI DSS requirements and other best practices for securing telephone-based payment card account data in a telephony environment. More specifically, this document:  Considers why securing telephone-based account data is important.  Provides clear statements on PCI DSS scope in both simple and complex telephony environments. This approach is intended to support the full range of environments, telephony systems, and supporting technologies that entities use to accept telephone-based payments.  Provides guidance on documenting account data flows for a telephone-based cardholder data environment (CDE).  Considers applicability of PCI DSS requirements to simple and complex telephone environments.  Provides guidance on using third-party service providers for supporting telephone-based payments.  Provides guidance on using methods that may help minimize the amount of account data in each type of telephone.

of an organization’s information security program. Maintaining compliance with PCI DSS requires resources and financial investment. Using risk as the basis for measuring security effectiveness can make it easier for security teams to justify the expenditures necessary for building a comprehensive security and compliance program. 3.5.4 Standardized Control Frameworks The most successful organizations develop their security programs based on security principles in conjunction with a particular industry or regulatory mandate, such as the PCI DSS. They develop high-level security objectives and control activities designed to address risks to the organization’s IT infrastructure. These organizations then integrate specific compliance-mandated controls under the umbrella of the larger security control framework, enabling adjustments where necessary. Integrating PCI DSS controls into a larger, common set of security controls facilitates ongoing PCI DSS compliance. A single, comprehensive, security framework allows security teams to focus on a single target rather than trying to accommodate multiple (and sometimes conflicting) sets of requirements. It also provides a common set of terms and metrics that can help avoid confusion when articulating security and compliance strategies to key stakeholders. When PCI DSS is integrated into an organization’s overall risk-based security strategy, it becomes easier to incorporate PCI DSS activities into the normal day-to-day operations. This integration provides support to ensure these activities are conducted on a regular, ongoing basis, making PCI DSS compliance more manageable. Note: Some organizations may choose to develop their security frameworks internally. However, most simply adopt existing standardized security control frameworks such as those provided by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and ISACA. (See Appendix A, “Sample of Industry-Standard Security Frameworks,” for more information on these and other security control frameworks.) 10 Ponemon Institute, The State of Risk-based Security Management (Ponemon Institute, LLC, 2012 and 2013).

Those processes should: ▪ Be well aligned with the organization's business and security goals, ▪ Cover all in-scope facilities and locations, including retail outlets, data centers, and back-office locations, ▪ Ensure PCI DSS requirements are in place and operating effectively, ▪ Ensure personnel continue to follow appropriate security procedures, ▪ Consider any changes within the organization, operating environment, and implemented technologies, and ▪ Produce sufficient evidence to illustrate continued adherence to security requirements. To understand how an organization’s security program performs on a day-to-day basis, organizations should develop strategies to continuously monitor and document the implementation, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and status of all of required and defined security controls. 3.6.1 Scoping Review In order to ensure that security controls cover all in-scope facilities, locations, retail outlets, data centers, back-office locations, etc., it is important to accurately determine the scope of the cardholder data environment. There are a number of factors that can impact the scope of CDE including: changes to network infrastructure affecting segmentation controls, changes to the operational processes (e.g., additional backup/recovery site), implementation of new business processes (e.g., introduction of an e-commerce payment channel), insourcing and outsourcing, connected-to systems, and mergers and acquisitions. Continuous monitoring of security-control processes should identify any changes that have the potential to impact the scope of PCI DSS assessment and should confirm that the implemented controls adequately cover the people, processes, and technologies that store, process, or transmit cardholder data or sensitive authentication data, or can impact the security of cardholder data environment. As part of the process to confirm the accuracy of PCI DSS scope, an organization should: ▪ Review and confirm that all instances of cardholder data in the environment are documented and that no cardholder data exists outside of the currently defined CDE, using data-discovery techniques with manual validation. ▪ Review dataflow and network diagrams, system inventory, and implemented network- segmentation controls to confirm that the PCI DSS scope is accurately represented. All types of systems and locations, including backup/recovery sites and systems, should be considered as part of the scoping process.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 18 It is important for organizations to retain evidence (see 3.6.7, “Maintaining Evidence ,”) to demonstrate that the periodic PCI DSS scope review was conducted, as this may be required during the annual PCI DSS assessment. For more information, refer to the Information Supplement: Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation, which is intended to provide a further understanding of scoping and segmentation principles as applicable to the PCI DSS environment.11 3.6.2 Review of Compensating Controls PCI DSS requires that compensating controls are reviewed and validated by the assessor on an annual basis. The assessor is required to thoroughly evaluate compensating controls during each annual PCI DSS assessment to validate that each compensating control adequately addresses the risk the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to address. To maintain compliance, processes and controls must be in place to ensure compensating controls remain effective after the assessment is complete. The process should include a periodic: ▪ Review of the

a saying where software ate the world and now there's a saying where AI is eating the software which is eating the world. And I think we're going to enter an era where AI agents are going to perform a lot of tasks that once were performed by humans. And so, from a knowledge work perspective, what sort of things can we start to outsource to agents? Or first of all, I mean, just educating the audience, what AI agents are and what type of tasks can they take on? What sort of agent tools can we build internally versus find a vendor to outsource to. So, that's a lot of the parts of the presentation and the takeaway is that the evolution of how AI is going to replace traditional apps and become the new interface and how payments will become more invisible, automatic and embedded. And also, a view on what the future consumer expects. We're so spoiled as consumers where if something is delivered even a couple of days late, we're either canceling the order or looking towards a competitor, but our consumers are going to be more and more demanding with speed, with the way that we want our services to be personalized to us. And so, what can vendors and companies do in this new ecosystem, in this new environment? Alicia Malone: Your keynote sounds so exciting, and I cannot wait to hear it! I know that the payments industry is one of those areas that is constantly changing and innovating. So, I can't wait to hear how your findings and your expertise really fit into knowing what the future holds for us in the payments industry. And since you're on Coffee with the Council , we like to ask our guests how they take their coffee or if you're not a coffee drinker, what do you prefer instead? Sharon Gai: I'm absolutely a coffee drinker. However, I also, I don't know where you live, but I live in New York and recently we just had a lot of Chinese bubble tea shops open up. And so, that's also with this wave of Chinese companies that's, you know, at first, they outsourced sort of physical goods and then they outsource all the apps like the TikTok, the Shein, the Temu. Now this next trend or this next wave of export is going to be these F&B, food and beverage, type of models. There’s this tea brand that is gaining popularity. It's called HeyTea, like H-E-Y-Tea. They'll probably be coming to a city near you in the U.S. because they have very ambitious plans in following suits in the footsteps of Starbucks and having a store around every major shopping mall and busy intersection. So, I'm drinking a lot of that these days: HeyTea. Alicia Malone: I love it. Well, I'm based in the Pacific Northwest. I'm in Oregon. And so, we take our coffee and our Starbucks very seriously. But I also really, really love bubble tea. And you've sold me on this HeyTea. I can't wait to try this. Sharon Gai: Yeah, I wonder, I know it's definitely in L.A. on the West Coast. I don't know about Oregon. I feel like the coffee stronghold might be very strong for HeyTea to break into. So, maybe Oregon might be one of the last places. Alicia Malone: It might be. Sharon Gai: Since coffee culture is so strong there, who knows? Alicia Malone: That's so true. Well, thank you so much for joining us on Coffee with the Council , Sharon, and we look forward to seeing you at the Community Meeting this fall. Sharon Gai: Thanks so much! I look forward to the event that's coming up very soon as well. Alicia Malone: You can catch Sharon on stage as the keynote speaker at PCI SSC's Asia-Pacific Community Meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, November 5th and 6th.

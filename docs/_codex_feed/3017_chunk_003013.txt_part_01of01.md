DSS compliance and which reporting method they should use.

The merchant may operate other payment channels and there may be other cardholder data flows related to or supporting the e-commerce payment channel that need to be taken into consideration when scoping the merchant’s PCI DSS environment. The diagram below illustrates some of other payment methods and cardholder data flows that may be present: Figure 7 – E-commerce in Conjunction with all Card Data Flows and Payment Channels By considering all payment methods and cardholder data flows, the merchant may find that despite the fact that the e-commerce website is set up to redirect the consumer to a hosted payment page, it is not eligible for SAQ A. For example, because of the following payment card handling activities, other PCI DSS requirements may be applicable:  Telephone orders: o The merchant’s call center staff provide support for consumers having difficulty ordering online. The call center can take orders and payments for these consumers. In this example the call center uses a mail order/telephone order (MOTO) portal (web application) supported from the same e-commerce infrastructure as the consumer storefront. (See PCI SSC FAQ Information Supplement • Best Practices for Securing E-commerce • April 2017 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 26 1439 for more information.) The MOTO portal is also configured to redirect to the PSP’s hosted payment page. The merchant will need to consider the scope implications of taking payments on corporate PCs, through a VoIP telephone system (transmitting CHD), and whether they are recording the calls. In all cases, they may be capturing cardholder data and sensitive authentication data. o Call center staff also have a back-up payment terminal for use when the website is out of service. The merchant will need to consider how is this connected, and whether the receipts contain the full card number.  Refund requests: o The merchant’s customer service team process refunds for online orders. In this example, they manually rekey the customer card details into the PSP’s virtual terminal. The merchant should consider whether there is an alternative method that allows it to refund a transaction without re-entering the cardholder data; if not it will need to consider the scope implications as with the call center.  Retrieval requests and chargebacks: o The merchant’s finance team may receive retrieval requests and chargeback letters from its acquirer. Typically, these contain the full card number. The merchant will need to consider how these letters are handled. Are the letters retained in hard or soft copy? Are the letters scanned or e-mailed? Scanned chargeback letters containing the full card number (instead of only the last four digits or a replacement token) would be considered electronic storage of cardholder data, negating eligibility for any SAQ other than D. The acquirer may offer alternative methods for the merchant to eliminate handling of full card numbers, such as an acquirer extranet chargeback notification service. From these examples, we can see that although the merchant has outsourced the handling of e- commerce payment card data to the PSP, merchant PCI DSS compliance assessment using only the SAQ A is no longer appropriate as is does not cover all of its payment card handling activities. 2.11 Additional Considerations It is one thing to look for the best or most innovative e-commerce technology on the market; however, this does not guarantee that the customer’s card data will be protected. Many businesses are searching for SPs to provide various security features along with the “seamless” payment processing solution offered in order to make the most informed decision. In this section, we will discuss the features that merchants may also want to consider when selecting the most appropriate e-commerce implementation for their CHD processing environment while not compromising on the integrity of the solution’s security features. 2.11.1 Anti-Fraud Considerations As a standard business practice, companies must implement and consistently manage some level of an adequate governance program. This would include the execution of compliance, training, and audit programs in order to protect a company’s assets—the most important being the consumer and the Information Supplement • Best Practices for Securing E-commerce • April 2017 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

Consequently, many aspects of an entity’s governance program can be outsourced to minimize scope and exposure. If a company decides to manage its own anti-fraud program with respect to CHD and has CHD in the clear (instead of a replacement token), this may mean that its scope has been expanded to include its corporate structure. Therefore, companies must determine whether and how they will conduct their own anti-fraud programs. Some service providers manage the overall processing, transmitting, and/or storage of cardholder data along with anti-fraud tools and analytics as a value-added

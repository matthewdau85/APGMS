has been included that supplement existing guidance. This information may be especially relevant to merchants who are evaluating the use of a service provider to provide secure e-commerce payment processing solutions through APIs, redirects, and Direct Posts (see Section 2). Common Security and Fraud Control Services Service Description Instant Merchant Notification A feedback loop from the PSP to the merchant ensures that the merchant is immediately informed of transactions, and can raise alerts when suspicious activity is observed that is not otherwise detected. Where this notification is passed programmatically to a merchant API endpoint (e.g., “postback”), the PSP should provide a mechanism to ensure that the destination is not changed by a malicious user or that the postback does not contain account data. Authentication It is recommended that PSPs support the use of a limited-use token that can be retrieved or generated. This method may be used to authenticate the source of the transaction. Data Verification PSPs may support the use of cryptographic hashes to verify that important data passed from the merchant to the PSP remains unaltered in the hand-off (e.g., shipping information). Verification failures should be logged to alert merchants to possible man-in- the-middle attacks. Address Verification Service (AVS) AVS is a system supported by the card brands, where numeric address information from the street address and postal code are passed to the issuing bank for verification. This control may be very effective for preventing fraud or redirected shipping information from a man-in-the-middle. CVV2 Verification CVV2 verification is the recommended cardholder verification method for card-not- present merchants. Card data stolen from card-present merchants should not contain this value, and thus should be unusable online if proper verification is performed. Note that CVV2 is considered sensitive authentication data (SAD) and should never be stored by the PSP after authorization. Transaction Amount Floors/Limits Blocking or reviewing transactions that fall outside minimum and maximum transactions amounts can prevent carding, where fraudsters attempt to identify which of their stolen cards are still active.

Granular configurations often exist to measure similar transactions within a short time frames (e.g., transactions per second, transactions per hour) based on common source, type, or other attribute. These features are often called “velocity controls.” Brute Force / Trial- and-error Detection Duplicate transactions with altered information (different source IP, different expiration date, or different CVV2) should be cause for suspicion. These may indicate attempts to bypass other fraud tests or verify stolen card data that may be incomplete or expired. E-mail Verification Some PSPs may offer verification services to confirm whether an ISP e-mail account originates from the IP of the ISP itself or whether fraudsters commonly use that e-mail domain. This test is insufficient to identify fraud but may be used in fraud scoring. Geographic Verification Common geography verifications include comparing the provided physical address with the geographic region associated with the source IP, or the area code of the provided phone number. IP Blacklisting Manual blocking of IPs and IP ranges allows the merchant to prevent abuse from known sources. Some PSPs offer access to known sources of suspicious activity, such as proxies or regions known for malicious activity. IP Whitelisting For merchants who send transactions to the PSP via API, an IP whitelist is crucial to confirm that the transactions originate from the trusted system(s), and not from a man-in- the-middle attacker. HTTP Header Verification For merchants who use redirect (including iFrame), Direct Post, or JavaScript methods to pass customer data from the browser to the service provider, the PSP may monitor the incoming HTTP headers to ensure that the customer originated from the expected e- commerce site or is using a common browser. Some browsers will hide this information for privacy reasons so it cannot be relied upon with full accuracy, but an increase in missing referrer information or non-standard browsers can be an indication of fraud or compromise. Identity Verification While somewhat more expensive than other verification methods, confirming the identity of the customer against third-party sources such as credit files or public records can reduce fraud. Verification may also include checking the validity of address information against postal system databases or validating phone numbers through text or voice confirmation. Prohibited Data Blocking specific cardholder name, credit card BINs, card types, e-mail domains, phone numbers, addresses, etc. may be useful for merchants that need to block transactions manually based on known customer characteristics or history of abuse. PSPs may also offer access to databases with known abuse data. Other Proprietary Filters Some fraud detection may occur based on algorithms or heuristic transaction evaluation that is based on proprietary methods. While the approach itself may not be disclosed to the merchant, these services can vary in their effectiveness at identifying fraud.

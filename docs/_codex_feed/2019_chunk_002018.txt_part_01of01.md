NPP community has a common reference of key API design considerations and how they may be approached by the industry; and • Identify applicable standards for NPP data transfer, data constructs and security NPP API Framework – Publication Version 5.0 Page 6 Sample APIs To provide Third Party Service Providers and software developers with an understanding of how to utilise the NPP API Framework, sample NPP APIs have been included as part of the framework documentation. The sample NPP APIs include usage guidelines in .pdf and excel format as well as a JSON example. The samples include the following: • Look up of a PayID which will validate that the PayID exists and if valid return the associated short name and status - API: pain.a11.001.04 (Get Account Servicer by Alias); Please note that this API will be amended in the next version of the NPP API Framework as the BIC of the Payee Participant will no longer be returned in the API response. • Submit a payment initiation request to process a payment - API: pain.a09.001.05 (Submit Payment); • Confirm completion of payment - API: pain.a10.001.03 (Get Payment Status); • Submit a request to return a previously submitted payment – API: camt.a09.001.02 (Cancel Payment); • Confirm the status of the previously submitted Cancel Payment – API: pain.a48.001.01 (Get Cancellation Status) • Submit a request to return a previously received payment – API: camt.a10.001.02 (Return Payment); • Fetch payment details of a debit or credit from/to their account – API: camt.a11.001.04 (Payment Event Details); and • Send notification of a payment event, debit or credit, from/to an account – API: camt.a12.001.03 (Event Notification). • Initiate one or more interbank payments as individual debits or as a single batch debit – API: pain.a46.001.03 (Batch Payment Initiation) • Confirm completion of batch payment – API: pain.a47.001.01 (Batch Payment Status) • Fetch details of a batch of debits from their account – API: camt.a13.001.03 (Batch Payment Event Details) PayTo APIs: The following sample APIs can be used to perform certain functions related to the NPP PayTo service. The term ‘mandate’ refers to a PayTo agreement that is authorised by the Payer customer. • Submit a request to create a Mandate – API: pain.a12.001.01 (Create Mandate) • Get details of a specific mandate – API: pain.a13.001.01 (Get Mandate By ID) • Submit a request to amend an existing mandate – API: pain.a14.001.01 (Amend Mandate) • Confirm the validity of a mandate – API: pain.a15.001.01 (Validate Mandate) • Retrieve the current status of a mandate – API: pain.a16.001.01 (Get Mandate Status) • Submit a request to change the status of a mandate – API: pain.a17.001.01 (Change Mandate Status) • Fetch details of a specific action performed on a mandate – API: pain.a22.001.01 (Get Mandate Action) NPP API Framework – Publication Version 5.0 Page 7 • Provide a resolution to a pending mandate action – API: pain.a23.001.01 (Resolve Mandate Action) • Query on the MMS to retrieve a list of mandates that match a selection criteria – API: pain.a36.001.01 (Mandate Enquiry) API Method API Name Description pain.a09.001.05 POST /payment/submit Submit Payment pain.a10.001.03 GET /payment/{transaction_identification }/status Get Payment Status pain.a11.001.04 GET /accountServicer/alias Get Account Servicer by Alias camt.a09.001.02 POST /cancelPayment/submit Cancel Payment camt.a10.001.02 POST /returnPayment/submit Return Payment camt.a11.001.04 GET /paymentEventDetails/{notification_i dentification}/event Payment Event Details camt.a12.001.02 POST /paymentEventNotification/submit Event Notification camt.a13.001.03 GET /BatchEventDetails/{notification_ide ntification}/event Batch Payment Event Details pain.a46.001.03 POST /payment/submitBatch Batch Payment Initiation pain.a47.001.01 GET /payment/batch/status Batch Payment Status pain.a48.001.01 GET /cancellations/{case_id}/status Get Cancellation Status PayTo APIs API Method API Name Description pain.a12.001.01 POST /Post/mandates Create Mandate pain.a13.001.01 GET /get/mandates/{mandateId} Get Mandate By ID pain.a14.001.01 PATCH /patch/mandates/{mandateId} Amend Mandate pain.a15.001.01 GET /get/mandates/{mandateId}/validity Validate Mandate pain.a16.001.01 GET /get/mandates/{mandateId}/status Get Mandate Status pain.a17.001.01 PATCH /patch/mandates/{mandateId}/statu s Change Mandate Status pain.a22.001.01 GET /get/mandates/actions/{actionId} Get Mandate Action NPP API Framework – Publication Version 5.0 Page 8 pain.a23.001.01 PATCH /patch/mandates/actions/{actionId} Resolve Mandate Action pain.a36.001.01 POST /post/mandates/details Mandate Enquiry Approach This document describes a development framework and refers to other related reference material. To facilitate use of the document, each section has sub-sections to highlight key themes or processes NPP Participants and third parties should consider in their development of API solutions for NPP. It is intended to be of use to both existing and prospective NPP Participants, Third Party Service Providers and software developers. The use of the API Framework document as a source of information does not affect or alter: (a) any rights or obligations of NPP Participants under the NPPA Regulations and NPP Procedures. For the avoidance of doubt, where there is any inconsistency between this document and the NPP Regulations and Procedures, or an NPPA-approved NPP design document, those documents prevail to the extent of the inconsistency; or (b) the rights or obligations of NPP Participants as data controllers, to comply with privacy laws and to establish their own permission frameworks and requirements for secure data transfer. 1.4. API Sandbox NPPA in conjunction with SWIFT have developed an API sandbox to help Third Party Service Providers and software developers to learn and test the NPP’s capabilities via the available sample NPP APIs. External parties can build and test NPP based solutions in this independent environment.

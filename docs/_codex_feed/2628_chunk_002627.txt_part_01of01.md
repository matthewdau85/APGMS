Ongoing compliance benefits from centralized coordination of numerous technologies, processes, and people. An individual responsible for compliance (a Compliance Manager) should be: ▪ Assigned overall responsibility for these activities, ▪ Qualified to perform such functions⎯e.g., have knowledge and experience managing compliance programs, ▪ Knowledgeable in the organization’s business structure and payment processes, ▪ Given adequate funding and resources (e.g., tools, education, budget, etc.), and ▪ Granted the proper authority to effectively organize and allocate such resources. Note: Compliance Managers might also benefit from industry certifications⎯for example, those managed by the associations such as ISACA, the International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium ((ISC)²), and the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC). Smaller organizations may need to look at choosing someone who is familiar with the cardholder data environment and credit card processes and may want to work with the acquiring bank (i.e., acquirer) or engage a Qualified Security Assessor for additional guidance. The Compliance Manager should be responsible for securing management support (see 4, “Commitment to Maintaining Compliance”), coordinating the implementation and monitoring of the security controls (see 3.6, “Continuously Monitor Security Controls”), and engaging key personnel or functional groups (see Appendix B, “Common Assessment Roles & Responsibilities” for more information on common functional resources frequently consulted during PCI DSS assessments) with appropriate expertise and skill sets as part of the efforts to ensure all necessary security functions are performed as required (see Appendix D: PCI DSS Compliance Program Activities,” for a list of recommended activities). Additionally, the Compliance Manager should be responsible for collecting, collating, and storing evidence to demonstrate that required PCI DSS security controls are operating effectively on a continuous basis. While the Compliance Manager is not typically tasked with generating all of the evidence, the individual in this role could be responsible for making certain the evidence is prepared, indexed, and stored in a central repository for use during assessments or internal reviews (see 3.6.7, “Maintaining Evidence ”). It is also important that the Compliance Manager be aware of organizational changes in business process and the evolution of PCI DSS requirements, to identify changes to the scope the cardholder data environment and ensure that appropriate security controls are maintained and modified as Information Supplement • Best Practices for Maintaining PCI DSS Compliance • January 2019 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

Finally, an organization should provide reasonable assurance that the goals and objectives of its compliance program are consistently achieved despite changes in program ownership (i.e., employee turnover, change of management, organization merger, re-organization, etc.). Best practices include proper knowledge transfer, documentation of existing controls and the associated responsible individual(s) or team(s), PCI DSS compliance history, etc. 3.5 Emphasize Security and Risk Management to Attain and Maintain Compliance PCI DSS provides a minimum set of security requirements for protecting payment card account data. PCI DSS controls alone may not be sufficient to adequately mitigate all the risks associated with other types of sensitive data organizations may possess, and should therefore not be used as a comprehensive checklist for addressing all security needs. It is likely that additional controls may be needed depending on the size, complexity, and business model of an organization. Compliance with industry standards or regulations does not inherently equate to better security. Organizations that focus solely on compliance often do so to the detriment of security. A more effective approach is to focus on building a culture of security and protecting an organization’s information assets and IT infrastructure, and allow compliance to be achieved as a consequence. Using a risk-based approach for selecting security controls allows organizations to tailor specific security controls to meet varying levels of organizational risk. Note: Utilizing a risk-based approach or framework as part of the organization’s information security program does not imply that organizations can consider applicable PCI DSS requirements or related compensating controls as “low risk” and avoid implementing the required PCI DSS control. Furthermore, the organization should include in its risk-assessment areas and services that are being managed by third-party service providers with the mindset that in order to achieve and maintain compliance with PCI DSS, the organization and its third-party service providers must meet all applicable PCI DSS requirements. 3.5.1 Risk Assessments The requirement for annual risk assessments in PCI DSS Requirement 12.2 necessitates that organizations “implement a risk assessment process that is performed at least annually and upon significant changes to the environment; identifies critical assets, threats, and vulnerabilities; and results in a formal risk assessment.” Risk assessments provide valuable information to help organizations with determining whether or not additional controls may be necessary to protect sensitive data and other important business assets, and to better understand risks and their impact on key business objectives.

annual statement for that card type. However, some merchants may have other costs of accepting a particular type of card that they would like to include in their surcharge. These may include: • gateway fees paid to a payment service provider IAC CODE SET VOLUME 1 - INTRODUCTION AND MEMBER OBLIGATIONS ANNEXURE F NOTICE OF STANDARD MERCHANT PRICING FOR CREDIT, DEBIT AND PREPAID CARD TRANSACTIONS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 68 • the cost of fraud prevention services paid to an external provider • any Terminal costs paid to a provider other than the merchant’s acquirer or payments facilitator • the cost of insuring against forward delivery risk. This applies to agents (such as travel agents) who pay an external party to insure against the risk that the agent will be liable to a customer for the failure of a principal supplier (such as an airline or hotel) on payments accepted via cards. If those costs meet the requirements for inclusion and can be documented, merchants will be able to add them to the costs charged by their acquirer or payment facilitator over the previous year and, based on their total costs, calculate their average percentage cost for that card system. Merchants may not surcharge above this average cost. END

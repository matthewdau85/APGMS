stopping scams at source than the – structurally reactive – reimbursement model used in the UK. Nonetheless, the opportunity here is to learn from the best of breed internationally: Australia will be watching the UK – and countries like Singapore and Malaysia (which have both banned SMS with links) – in the same way that increasingly they are looking to Australia for best practice. My travels to the UK coincided with the Global Fraud Summit, where a number of countries including Australia signed a four-part communique to tackle scams. This is an important step in building international collaboration, to identify and pursue the criminal syndicates behind the scams and to repatriate funds. Ultimately scams are a crime, and a multinational one at that. In preventing that crime, we truly are better together. top Update on payments reforms In the last Payments Monitor , CEO Andy White outlined three major Government consultations that we responded to in early 2024: the payments licensing framework, the wind-down of the Australian cheques system, and mandatory industry scam codes. At this stage, Treasury continues to review stakeholder submissions and determine the path forward on all of these policy issues. We will engage with Members once Treasury releases its conclusions and next steps for each of these consultations. top Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) migration program update In April, the fifth Standards and Requirements Working Group meeting was held, where Members endorsed the latest version of the AES Technical Blueprint Handbook, representing the target state that could be used for migrating to AES. The handbook will be taken to the Issuers and Acquirers Forum (IAF) for approval. The third Migration Planning Working Group was also held in April. Members were presented with a proposal on the principles, approach, and assumptions to be adopted for the AES Migration Plan (as set out in the Migration Strategy (Approach and Plan)). Following approval of the Industry Testing Working Group Terms of Reference at the IAF meeting in March, a testing consultancy has been engaged to deliver the following plans in 2024: Industry Testing Assessment of requirements for the migration Industry Testing Strategy (Approach and Plan) for the migration Industry Testing Inputs for assurance of the AES Migration Program. The Member nominations for the Industry Testing Working Group were requested in April, with the first meeting due to be held in June. A Member Readiness Survey was issued to the Issuers and Acquirers Community in April. The survey results will provide an understanding to AusPayNet of Member readiness for an AES migration and confidence in the AES Migration Program; they will be anonymised, summarised, and provided to the IAF in due course. Further surveys will be issued in August and November, and the results will provide input to development of an overall Change Management Plan for the AES Migration Program. top Authorised standards-setting body (ASSB) program update Treasury’s response to its second consultation on the new payments service provider (PSP) licensing framework is expected to be released later this year. In the interim, AusPayNet is continuing to develop the supporting processes to facilitate standards-setting and a potential standards pipeline. The Standards Pipeline and Process Consultation will be released following Treasury’s conclusions. One of the proposed test case topics on the standards pipeline relates to addressing frictions to merchants in the porting of gateway tokens, an area the RBA identified in its Expectations for Tokenisation of Payment Cards and Storage of PANs . The initial discovery phase for this is underway; it has included consultation with 30 entities involved in the end-to-end tokenisation value chain and the convening of a Tokenisation Industry Working Group (TIWG). The TIWG acknowledged that the current lack of standardisation in information ported between gateways can cause lock-in for merchants if the merchant does not hold the PAN, and there is merit in addressing this problem statement and improving token portability. Further exploration, as part of the standards scoping process, is now underway to establish whether a minimum set of technical standards for gateway token portability could address the identified issues. top Cross-border payments update Technical assistance Recognising the need to extend the benefits of the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-Border Payments for both G20 and non-G20 countries, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) will collaborate on providing technical assistance , particularly to those payment corridors of emerging markets and developing economies which face urgent issues, to address cross-border payment challenges. Interlinking fast payment systems In April, the RBA published a study group report, Interlinking Fast Payment Systems for Cross-Border Payments . A full business case assessment for interlinking the New Payments Platform was outside the scope of the study group, but the findings show clear benefits for end-users including speed, price and non-price transparency, and access. Industry participants and jurisdictions will be able to consider a range of new opportunities, such as those presented by interlinking of fast payment systems, as they strive to improve the cross-border payments global targets. Cross-Border Payments Round-Up In March, we published the latest edition of the Cross-Border Payments Round-Up , a biannual newsletter providing updates on the progress of the G20 Roadmap. Read the newsletter on AusPayNet’s website . top Economic crime update In April, the ECF met on the Gold Coast, coinciding with national law enforcement meetings. ECF working groups continue to consider how providing requested payments data to police can become more efficient. Law enforcement agencies briefed the ECF

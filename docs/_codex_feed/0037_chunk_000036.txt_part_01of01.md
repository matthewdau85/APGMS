Welcome from our Program Sponsor Welcome to the first edition of The Quantum Leap , your quarterly update on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Migration Program. The migration to AES will be the most significant security upgrade for Australia’s national card payments system in the last 25 years. Each quarter, we will bring you a high-level update on the progress of the program and what’s ahead. We will also provide updates on developments in Australia and globally, and will focus on cyber security, cryptography and the impacts of classical and quantum computing. Your suggestions for topics in future publications and feedback on our first edition are welcomed. Please feel free to contact us by email at aesmigrationprogramteam@auspaynet.com.au . We hope you enjoy this first edition. Riaz Hussain Program Sponsor & Head of Security & Standards, AusPayNet What is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)? AES and the Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES) are cryptographic algorithms that protect sensitive card payment data during transmission and storage. TDES is currently widely used in the Australian payments system. However, advances in computing technology, including the increasing power of classical computing and quantum computing, present a material risk to the effectiveness of TDES. Compared to TDES, AES is widely recognised as a more secure cryptographic algorithm that is resistant to the fastest, currently identified quantum algorithms. AES was specifically established by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001 to replace TDES, offering much greater security and efficiency. The key differences between AES and TDES, include: AES involves multiple and longer key lengths (which contribute to the security strength of algorithms), all of which are more secure than TDES. Longer key lengths contribute to stronger protection. AES also employs a more elegant encryption process with a more complex set of operations, which makes it significantly more resistant to cryptographic attacks. AES is faster and more efficient than TDES, which is important for processing large volumes of payments quickly. Adoption of AES would substantially reduce the likelihood of an attack on payments data, increasing the security and integrity of the card payments system as a whole and benefitting consumers and businesses. AES and Government’s strategic plan for payments In June 2023, the Australian Government released its Strategic Plan for Australia’s Payments System , setting out key priorities to support a safer, more efficient, and future-ready payments landscape. One of the key priorities of the Plan is promoting a safe and resilient payments system that protects end-users and safeguards their ability to transact safely and securely. This includes ensuring the payments industry is well-placed to protect against cyber-attacks and requiring the industry to continually uplift system-wide security standards and practices, including encryption methods for card payments systems. The Plan requires the Australian cards payment industry to begin migration to AES in 2025. This process necessitates the design, development, and delivery of a program to migrate our card payments system from TDES to AES cryptography standards. AES Migration Program scope AusPayNet is leading an industry-wide program to migrate the Australian card payments system to AES. The program is planned for completion in 2030/31, subject to any necessary regulatory approvals. The project has a broad scope, bringing together 55 issuers, 25 acquirers, the card schemes, and almost one million payment terminals and ATMs, with the purpose of moving to a more secure and efficient card payments system. Image: Typical card transaction flow We are managing the program through the Issuers and Acquirers Community. This has broad representation across the industry and is the natural framework for this kind of program. The following illustrates the program’s journey to date. Early 2022 AusPayNet surveyed Issuers and Acquirers Community Members to understand the appetite to migrate to AES and received strong support for the migration. September 2022 – June 2023 AusPayNet commissioned a plan of work to develop a Program Initiation Document for the AES migration, which was approved by the AusPayNet Board in mid-2023. This document foreshadowed an 18-month initiation and mobilisation phase, which we commenced in July 2023. July – December 2024 This phase delivered the initial versions of the foundational documents for the program, including: The Technical Blueprint, outlining the target state for the migration and referencing the various standards that apply across the whole card payments system. The Migration Strategy, articulating how we propose to undertake the migration, the principles we will adopt, how we will manage co-existence, and the framework of dates that will apply for both the sunrise of AES and the sunset of TDES. The Industry Test Strategy, describing the approach to be taken to testing and certification throughout the program, which is complementary to the approaches adopted by each of the card schemes. Collectively, this work serves as a key input to card payments system participants in developing their organisations’ own migration plans. Where are we now? Our current phase of focus (2025) is on preparation for pilot, currently scheduled for 2026. Key deliverables from this phase include: An update to the Technical Blueprint to include amendments to the relevant Australian Standard, AS2805. A migration handbook, which will provide further guidance to participants on how to go about the migration and will be the repository of lessons learned as we proceed. Industry Testing Plans and the supporting tools that participants will require. Requirements for an information management system to enable the industry to track progress. An uplift in communications and change activities

Australian Payments Plus (AP+), at the forefront of Australia’s payments industry and a leading provider of digital identity solutions through its ConnectID brand welcomed the passage by the Senate of the Digital ID Bills. AP+ Chief Executive Officer, Lynn Kraus said the reforms represent another step forward in Australia's journey towards a more secure and inclusive digital future. “Through ConnectID, businesses benefit from knowing their customers’ identities are authenticated by a trusted source and consumers can rest assured they are sharing less data,” Ms Kraus said. The establishment of a secure, unified digital identity framework is a stride towards building a more efficient and secure digital ecosystem where businesses can thrive, and consumers can navigate the digital space with ease and confidence. Once in place, the digital identity framework will open new opportunities for productivity and provides enhanced security for people’s personal information. As Australia furthers its digital transformation, AP+ and ConnectID are excited to be part of the journey, leveraging the benefits of the digital identity system to deliver greater functionality and security for consumers and businesses in Australia,” Ms Kraus said.

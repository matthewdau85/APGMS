This paper is NPP Australia Limited’s submission in response to the RBA’s consultation on the New Payments Platform functionality and access. Introduction The New Payments Platform ( NPP ) has been designed to support a 24/7 modern, digital economy. It provides a fast, flexible and data-rich payments system for Australian consumers, businesses and government agencies, enabling them to make real-time data rich payments between accounts at participating Australian financial institutions. The NPP is new utility payments infrastructure commissioned and funded by NPP Australia Limited’s founding shareholders 1 for and on behalf of the Australian payments industry. NPP Australia Limited ( NPPA ) is a public company established to oversee the development and operation of the NPP. NPPA’s Constitution (Article 2.1) provides that the NPP is to operate as a mutually-owned utility, as an economically self-sustaining entity rather than profit-maximising or providing returns to its shareholders. The NPP brings enormous potential for future payments innovation through its speed, data capability, open-access design and unique layered architecture. The platform is intended to support multiple products and services as well as enable more digital processes, which will deliver back-office efficiencies and cost savings to Australian businesses and government agencies. Since the NPP launched to the public in February this year, more than 70 banks, credit unions and building societies have been rolling out real-time payment services to their customers. More than 50 million accountholders are now able to make and receive payments via the NPP and this number will continue to grow as participating financial institutions complete their respective rollouts. Volumes are growing steadily on the platform with over 50 million transactions worth over $45 billion being sent through the platform since February and over 2 million PayIDs registered. Accessing the NPP The NPP has been intentionally designed to be ‘open access’, encouraging broad participation across the payments ecosystem. One of the three stated constitutional objectives of NPPA is facilitating fair access to the NPP as mutually owned utility infrastructure . 2 It is the first clearing and settlement system in Australia to be designed with access as one of its primary objectives. Access arrangements for the NPP have been deliberately structured to be inclusive and to maximise the opportunities for different types of entities with different business objectives to access the capabilities of the NPP. NPPA has established graduated, risk-based, eligibility criteria, with relevant ACCC authorisation, for a range of different access points to the infrastructure. These access points are intended to meet the needs of different organisations, ranging from APRA-regulated Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions ( ADIs ) through to corporates and fintechs, whilst simultaneously ensuring the safety and security of a real-time payments system in which Australians must feel confident. There are five different ways an organisation can access the NPP: NPP Participant NPP Participants are organisations that connect directly to clear and/or settle payments via the NPP. All ADIs (of which there are more than 150 licensed by APRA), whether fully or conditionally licensed, or a Restricted ADI, are eligible to become NPP Participants. A directly connected Participant also needs to meet the technical requirements of standing up and maintaining an NPP Payment Access Gateway (PAG) in a real-time environment. There is also the option for a Participant to be indirectly connected to the NPP for clearing (whilst providing their own settlement services) by outsourcing their technical connectivity to one of the other directly connected Participants. Currently there are 8 directly connected Participants and 2 indirectly connected Participants. Becoming an NPP Participant requires an organisation to become a shareholder in NPPA and subscribe for shares. The requirement to subscribe for shares reflects the design of the NPP as mutually-owned industry infrastructure; dispersed ownership and associated governance rights ensure the NPP is operated and evolves to meets the diverse needs of users of the payments system. New Participants also bring capital that enables NPPA to fund the continuing development of central core capability and investment in future functionality which will drive further innovation. New Participants subscribe for shares at the same level of investment as current Participants, according to their size. It is possible that over time, and as the NPP matures and is fully developed in terms of its technical capabilities, NPPA’s technical roadmap will be fully sustained by operating revenues and less dependent on capital contributions, in which case the current subscription levels might be expected to trend towards the direct and indirect costs of connectivity. The requirement for a Participant, who clears and settles funds in real time, to be a regulated ADI is deemed necessary to ensure prudential safeguards for the platform, in line with well-established international standards for payments systems (as set out by the Bank for International Settlements 3 ). The ADI licensing regime managed by APRA covers extensive and ongoing prudential obligations, including standards for: capital adequacy; securitisation; risk management including liquidity, credit quality, large exposures and business continuity management; prudential reporting and disclosure of prudential information; governance including ‘fit and proper’ criteria for responsible persons operating that particular institution. In particular, an ADI is required to meet standards with respect to operational risk management, including Information Security risk, and is required to hold capital against operational losses. APRA regulated institutions are subject to a rigorous program of ongoing inspection, surveillance, and enforcement activities. An organisation that is not an ADI, and that is not prudentially supervised by APRA, does not provide the same level of counterparty

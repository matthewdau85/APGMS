• November 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 61 Diagram F4 shows a scenario where the payment details are taken over POTS or VoIP and processed through a virtual terminal hosted by a payment service provider via Internet. The entity’s computer would be in scope for PCI DSS.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 62 F.4 Payment Terminal Connected to a Network Via a VoIP Telephone Socket Some VoIP telephones provide the user with multiple connections sockets (e.g., RJ-45) to an IP network. One will be for telephony, the other(s) to connect devices such as, for example, a computer or a payment terminal to the office network. The telephone device acts as a switch or a router. Depending on the configuration of the telephone device, the telephony and secondary network segments could be either the same or segregated. In the example below (Diagram F5), the entity allows customers to pay via a website. The website infrastructure is completely segmented from the office network. No payment card data is captured using telephones. The operators receive the payment card data to process via a printed payment card data extract and process the payments using a PCI P2PE payment terminal connected to the VoIP telephone.

The networks connected to the telephone, including the telephone itself, are kept out of scope for PCI DSS. In this scenario, the web site infrastructure, the PCI P2PE payment terminal, and the printed payment card data extract are in scope for PCI DSS. F.5 Use of “Chat” for Card Payments When entities consider using their telephone environments to support customer communication using a “chat” application, it is worth highlighting once again that PAN cannot be sent unprotected. This applies to all end- user messaging technologies. If an entity requests PAN via end-user messaging technologies, the entity should provide a tool or method to protect these PANs using strong cryptography or render PANs unreadable before transmission. The data transmitted would be in scope for applicable PCI DSS controls. The eventual transmission of SAD would need special attention, especially its secure deletion after authorization.

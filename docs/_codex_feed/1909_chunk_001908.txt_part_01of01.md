Setting up a side hustle can be time consuming and daunting, especially if it takes off quickly. But as Melissa Young from Geelong Candle Co discovered, PayID helps business grow with instant and assured cash flow. Melissa started selling handmade candles to family and friends, and at weekend markets. But as demand for her products grew, she took her business online. “I needed a simple way for my customers to pay me. Customers will do things that are easy, but if it takes too much effort…forget it. With PayID, it’s just so simple. “There are no BSBs or 12-digit account numbers. The fact that my customers can see who they are paying their money to – they know that it’s coming to me – also means there are fewer mistakes,” Melissa said. Soon Melissa’s business started to grow and before long she was accepting wholesale orders. PayID means Melissa can process those orders with confidence. “If a big order comes through, I need that cashflow straight away so I can go and buy the stock to fulfill the order. Having that PayID payment straight away, directly into my account, is a huge bonus for a growing business like mine.” To see some of Melissa’s wonderful creations visit www.geelongcandles.com.au PayID is offered by your bank, building society or credit union. Look for PayID inside your internet or mobile banking, or contact your bank for more information.

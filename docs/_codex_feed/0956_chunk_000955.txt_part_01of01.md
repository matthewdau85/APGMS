Welcome to our podcast series, Coffee with the Council . I'm Alicia Malone, Director of Communications and Public Relations for the PCI Security Standards Council. As many of our listeners are aware, we are quickly approaching the deadline to adopt the future-dated requirements of PCI DSS version 4.0.1 on March 31st, 2025. Over the course of the last year, the Council has received feedback that more guidance was needed to properly implement some of the e-commerce security requirements in the standard, particularly Requirements 6.4.3 and 11.6.1. As such, the Council has released several pieces of guidance this year, including updates to Self-Assessment Questionnaire A, an FAQ related to SAQ A eligibility criteria, and of course, the highly anticipated guidance developed by our E-commerce Guidance Task Force. Joining me today to walk through all this new guidance is Lauren Holloway, Director of Data Security Standards at PCI SSC. Welcome, Lauren. Lauren Holloway: Thank you, Alicia. It's great to be with you today and to help clarify all this new information that the Council has released recently for our industry. Alicia Malone: So, let's start by talking a little bit more about these future-dated requirements in PCI DSS version 4.0.1 and the deadline to adopt them. What are they and what do we need to know about this deadline? Lauren Holloway: Well, there are 64 new requirements that were released in PCI DSS and 51 of them are future-dated. So, the future-dated requirements are effective, as Alicia said, on the 31st of March 2025. Requirements 6.4.3 and 11.6.1, that she mentioned, for e-commerce environments are part of these future-dated requirements. We received feedback that these requirements are challenging for many of our stakeholders, especially for smaller merchants, to implement them. So, we wanted to make sure we provided clarity and resources to assist them on their validation journey. Now, the deadline to adopt these new requirements is a date that we've been talking about for three years. PCI DSS version 4.0 was introduced in 2022, and it became the only active version of the standard when PCI DSS version 3.2.1 was retired on the 31st of March 2024. The future-dated requirements have been in the standard since March of 2022 as “best practices” until the 31st of March 2025. After this 2025 date, these requirements are required, and they must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. Alicia Malone: So, Lauren, why were these two e-commerce requirements added to PCI DSS version 4? Lauren Holloway: Well, in recent years, data breaches during e-commerce transactions, commonly known as e-skimming attacks, have increased significantly. As e-commerce platforms have become more complex and businesses have grown more reliant on external scripts in their e-commerce environments, these attacks have become more common. Scripts running in a consumer's browser are now a significant target for attackers seeking to steal payment card data. So, Requirements 6.4.3 and 11.6.1 were added to PCI DSS version 4.0 originally, and now version 4.0.1, to reduce the risk of e-skimming attacks during e-commerce transactions. These requirements focus on ensuring that payment page scripts are properly authorized, checked for integrity, and monitored for tampering, and to prevent unauthorized changes to web pages. Alicia Malone: That's great. The Council announced in November last year that it had formed an E-commerce Guidance Task Force, which brought together expertise from across the payment security ecosystem, including expertise from PCI SSC staff, payment brand representatives, members of the Board of Advisors and Technical Advisory Board, the Global Executive Assessor Roundtable, or GEAR, and the Small Merchant Business Task Force. What was the mission of this task force? Lauren Holloway: Yeah, Alicia, the objective of that task force was to develop guidance focusing on PCI DSS Requirements 6.4.3 and 11.6.1. Specifically, they were tasked to produce a guidance document that provides clear and actionable guidance about how entities can meet these two requirements, guidance for how third-party service providers can help their customers to meet these requirements, and practical implementation strategies rather than a theoretical framework. Now, this new guidance document was released last week. It's got kind of a long name. It's called “Payment Page Security and Preventing E-Skimming - Guidance for PCI DSS Requirements 6.4.3 and 11.6.1”. This document is intended for any entity that processes payment card transactions through e-commerce via embedded iframes or with a web page that can impact security of e-commerce payments. The information supplement provides specific guidance for merchants and third-party service providers working to meet PCI DSS Requirements 6.4.3 and 11.6.1. Alicia Malone: That sounds like that has been a great document in the works for some time now. So, in addition to producing this comprehensive guidance document, the Council also announced important modifications for merchants validating to Self-Assessment Questionnaire A, or commonly referred to as SAQ A. What can you tell us about these changes? Lauren Holloway: Well, before I go into that, it's important to remember that SAQ A includes only the PCI DSS requirements that are applicable to merchants with account data functions completely outsourced to PCI DSS compliant third parties where the merchant is retaining only paper reports or receipts with account data. And SAQ A merchants are either e-commerce merchants or they may be mail order, telephone order merchants. Basically, they're all card-not-present merchants. And these merchants don't store, process, or transmit any account data in electronic form on their systems or premises. So, the changes

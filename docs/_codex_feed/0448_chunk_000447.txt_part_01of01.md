Amendments to the SWIFT applications normally are introduced once a year, usually in November. SWIFT publishes throughout each year several versions of its “Advance Information Standards Release Guide” advising full details of the forthcoming changes to the SWIFT FIN Service standards. The first version of the Advance Information Standards Release Guide is normally issued in or around January each year. That guide also specifies the date on which the amended standards are to be introduced, although, particularly in the early stages, it is subject to change. (b) If the yearly changes to SWIFT standards directly affect the SWIFT PDS, the Management Committee will advise Framework Participants of these changes and details of action required by Framework Participants. (c) Each Framework Participant must implement changes to that member’s SWIFT PDS System in accordance with the Advance Standards Release Guide. Such changes will be reviewed when the Company reviews that member’s Yearly Audit Compliance Certificate (see Clause 7.28(a)).

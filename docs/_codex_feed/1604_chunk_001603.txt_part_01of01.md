This page provides a detailed list of terms applicable to the use of ATO digital wholesale services. This includes services provided through ATO Standard Business Reporting (SBR) and ATO API Portal. Other terms may be contained within service specific documentation. This page is intended for DSPs who are consuming or planning to consume these ATO digital wholesale services. The Bulk Data Exchange (BDE) platform has a different set of terms and conditions. Developers for this platform should refer to the Data Transfer Facility terms and conditions. When we say: we, us and our – we mean the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) you and your – we mean you as the Digital Service Provider (DSP) ATO digital wholesale services – we mean the electronic data system that we provide End user – we mean business entity and each individual sender End user product – we mean a software product created or developed for use by end users, which could include other Digital Service Providers. Find information about the legislative and operational restrictions on using our digital services including: Who can and can’t use our services: legal disclosure of information Division 355 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 and Part 1 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, prohibits us from disclosing protected information about the tax or superannuation affairs of a particular entity except in certain specified circumstances. Entities are not able to give consent to protected information being shared with third parties unless they are a covered entity such as a tax agent and in the approved form. Even if an entity gives consent, we cannot disclose their information outside of these circumstances. We only grant access to our APIs where you provide a service that supports entities to meet their reporting obligations. You must therefore consider the intended business purpose of the proposed service, verifying that the intended client or user will be: a business client - for the purpose of managing their taxation, payroll, superannuation, and/or registry affairs an intermediary or tax professional (such as a tax agent, BAS agent or Payroll provider) - for the purpose of administering taxation affairs a superannuation fund (trustee, or a representative) - for the purpose of administering superannuation obligations. Who can’t use our services: unsupported business models Some unsupported business models include providing software services: directly to individual taxpayers to lodge their own returns interacting with ATO online systems. Systems such as myTax, do not allow and have not been designed for external, third-party software interactions directly to a third-party to obtain an individual/businesses ATO data and sharing that data with another entity directly to individuals to obtain their own ATO data and share with another entity Examples of these business models could be software services: that enable individuals to lodge a basic income tax return without an agent for credit reporting agencies or loan brokers to verify income and employment details for financial planners to access ATO data for their clients, when they are not also intending to represent their client as a tax/BAS agent General Terms Conditions of use You agree to these Conditions of use when you register to be a Digital Service Provider (DSP) with us. They establish: the terms under which the ATO makes its developer material available, our expectations of you, our right to manage our systems, and that we have no obligation to provide access to our services. SBR and ATO API Portal each have their own conditions: Reasonable Use of ATO digital wholesale services The Reasonable Use policy outlines the expectations on reasonable use of ATO digital wholesale services. This policy complements service specific usage restrictions described within relevant business implementation guides, to ensure high levels of availability and responsiveness for all users. Whitelisting Process Access to ATO digital wholesale services is managed through DSP product whitelisting. Whitelisting grants access to ATO production or test environments. The whitelisting process commences with registration of an organisation in Online Services for DSPs, at which point your representative will make declarations, authorisations, and acknowledgements around the responsible consumption of ATO digital wholesale services. Final whitelisting is dependent upon acceptance of these conditions, and there are requirements to which you must adhere to maintain whitelisted status. Product ID Upon whitelisting, we will provide you with a unique Product ID for each of your products to include in messages transmitted to the ATO. A Product ID should not be used for multiple products. You are issued separate Product IDs for the testing and production environments. These may only be used to access their respective environment. Product IDs must be kept confidential and secure to ensure they are used only for their intended purpose. De-Whitelisting Process De-whitelisting is the process of suspending or revoking access to ATO production or test environments. A product may be de-whitelisted where: it is not compliant with our requirements the service generates a significant number of unexpected technical errors resulting in data issues, or a cyber incident presents a risk to our digital wholesale channel, ATO reputation or taxpayers. End-User Agreement End users of your product/s must accept our End-User Agreement. This agreement sets out the rights and restrictions in using ATO digital wholesale services. SBR and API Portal each have their own agreements: ATO Service Support Versioning Strategy Over time SBR services will change or be replaced to accommodate legislative, policy and technology changes. We will endeavour to work with you to minimise the impact

The comprehensive payroll series is flexible, easy to operate and is one of the most up-to-date top selling payroll systems in Australia. We are a major contributor to the STP consultative process as a member of the STP Advisory Group and many other STP Working Groups. We are constantly engaged with the ATO and were privileged to be part of STP "Limited Trial", where e-PayDay®'s first STP file was successfully submitted and processed by the ATO on the 6 July 2017. e-PayDay® is compliant with most ATO requirements, including PAYG, GST, SG, RESC and RFBA, tracks all types of leave including Personal, Annual and Long Service, maintains comprehensive employee records, generates over 140 reports, e-mails pay slips, electronic transfer of wages using the in-built ABA file creation functionality and exports your payroll information to most Accounting Software. e-PayDay® caters for Cost Centres, which can be used where an employee works over multiple Departments/Locations/Jobs and the hours worked in each department must be separated for costing and reporting. Award Interpretation is also integrated and when combined with Time and Attendance, removes the complexity and the chore of having to “work out” employee’s pays. As a strong supporter of micro businesses, e-PayDay® is also available FREE for less than 3 employees. e-PayDay® makes processing your payroll easy, giving you more time to enjoy life! 87 125 545 717 e-PayDay Go e-PayDay Pty Ltd Payroll (STP) Micro Small Medium Large Y https://www.e-payday.com.au/ We at e-PayDay believe that every employer should have access to powerful and comprehensive Single Touch Payroll software. Payroll solutions are often marketed as simple but often lack many necessary functions. The requirements for managing payroll for one employee are just as crucial as when handling payroll for hundreds. With over 37 years of experience developing payroll solutions, we understand there are no shortcuts, even for the smallest businesses. We are dedicated to continuously updating our payroll software to incorporate features and functionalities that help you comply with the often demanding government regulations. We primarily focus on the Fair Work Ombudsman and Australian Taxation Office requirements to ensure compliant payroll processing and are ISO 27001 independently audited and certified. Our pricing plans accommodate the budgets of most businesses, and we offer additional functionality that can be purchased separately. We don’t provide a trial, as the first three employees are always 100% free with no hidden costs or conditions. 87 125 545 717 e-PayDay Go FREEPAY e-PayDay Pty Ltd Payroll (STP) Micro Y www.freepay.com.au We are thrilled to announce that we now offer free cloud-based Single Touch Payroll (STP) software for small businesses with up to three employees.

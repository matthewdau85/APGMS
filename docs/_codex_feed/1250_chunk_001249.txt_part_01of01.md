be a transition period whereby lodgments can still be made using the previous CbC Report Schema version 1.0 up to 30 November 2020. 2 April 2020 From 1 October 2020, we will begin accepting lodgments of the CbC Report using version 2.0 of the CbC Report schema . 28 March 2019 The CbC reporting package on the Significant global entity obligations (SGEO) page on sbr.gov.au has been updated to reflect changes to the validation rules for the: Local File/Master File (LCMSF) 2018 service Country-by-Country report (CBC) 2017 service. These changes are expected to be deployed to EVTE on 18 April 2019 and production in late June 2019. Only the 2018 LCMSF service can be used to report periods starting on or after 1 January 2017. For lodgments relating to earlier periods, you may use either the 2017 or 2018 LCMSF service. 13 December 2018 A minor update has been made to the CbC report's validation rules to prohibit certain characters from being submitted as part of a lodgment. The updated validation rules are located on the sbr.gov.au Significant global entity obligations (SGEO) page. This change is expected to go into production on Friday 21 December. 1 August 2018 A fix for issue 817159 (Cardinality issue in the schema) and 858880 (LCMSF107 and LCMSF230) is expected to deploy to the External Vendor Testing Environment (EVTE) on Thursday 16 August. The fixes are expected to move to production on Saturday 29 September. As part of this deployment, an updated LCMSF schema will be published on the Significant global entity obligations page. Additionally, Validation Rule 46 will be relaxed to allow for the CBC Report Notification to be lodged without a Local File or Master File. 18 July 2018 The 2018 CbC Reporting Package has been finalised. The package is located on the sbr.gov.au Significant global entity obligations (SGEO) page. The 2018 Local File / Master File (LCMSF) service has been deployed into production for Bulk Data Exchange (BDE) and SBR . 9 July 2018 We have identified some CbC Report XML files have not met validation rules as stated in the OECD CbC Report XML Schema User Guide (PDF, 1.14 MB) and CbC Status Message XML Schema User Guide (PDF, 1.35 MB) . These validation rules are outlined in Table 1: Table 1 – DocRefID Validation Rules Error no. Validation name Validation description 80000 DocRefID already used The DocRefID is already used for another record. 80001 DocRefID format The structure of the DocRefID is not in the correct format. The DocRefID format must be in the following format: SendingCountryCodeFiscalYear-ReportingEntityIN-UniqueRef Where: Sending Country Code = AU Fiscal Year = the year to which the data relates, for example, 2017 for a report period ending 2017-12-31 Reporting Entity IN: ABN or TFN Unique Ref: A unique string of characters to make each DocRefID instance unique. For example, AU2017-123456789-akdno23. DocRefIDs must be unique in space and time. We are contacting affected parties to facilitate re-lodgment. All CbC Report XML files must conform to the validation rules outlined in Table 1 and Table 2. Conforming to these requirements will ensure domestically lodged CbC reports meet OECD requirements for exchange via the Common Transmission System. These validation rules will be not be enforced until later this year (around November 2018), with exact dates to be advised. If you follow the validation rules now, you will avoid the need to amend and re-lodge files at a later stage. Table 2 - Other Validation Rules Error no. Validation name Validation description 50010 File Contains Test Data for Production Environment The referenced file contains one or more records with a DocTypeIndic value in the range OECD10-OECD13, indicating test data. 50011 File Contains Production Data for Test Environment The referenced file was received in a test environment with one or more records having a DocTypeIndic value in the range OECD0-OECD3. These DocTypeIndic values indicate data in this file may have been intended as a valid CbC file submission. CbC messages received in test environments are not accepted by the receiving Competent Authority as a valid CbC file submission. Submissions to the test environment should only include records with DocTypeIndic in the range OECD10-OECD13, indicating test files. 80002 CorrDocRefId unknown The CorrDocRefId refers to an unknown record. 80003 CorrDocRefId no longer valid The corrected record is no longer valid (invalidated or outdated by a previous correction message). As a consequence, no further information should have been received on this version of the record. 80004 CorrDocRefId for new data The initial element specifies a CorrDocRefId. (OECD1 with CorrDocRefId data) 80005 Missing CorrDocRefId The corrected element does not specify any CorrDocRefId. (OECD2 or OECD3 submission without CorrDocRefId data) 80006 DocSpec, CorrMessageRefID The CorrMessageRefID is forbidden within the DocSpec_Type. 80007 MessageSpec. CorrMessageRefID The CorrMessageRefID is forbidden within the Message Header. 80010 Message TypeIndic A message can contain either new records (OECD1) or corrections/deletions (OECD2 and OECD3), but should not contain a mixture of both. 80011 CorrDocRefID twice in same message The same CorrDocRefID cannot be corrected or deleted twice in the same message. 3 July 2018 A fix for issues 855135 (Issue with validation rule VR.ATO.LCMSF.000083) and 855128 (Issue with validation rule VR.ATO.LCMSF.000087) will be deployed: Thursday 5 July – to the External Vendor Testing Environment (EVTE) Saturday 14 July – to production. More information about these issues is available in the 2018 CbC Reporting Package, located on the sbr.gov.au Significant global entity obligations (SGEO) page. 26

This is similar to an unattended terminal. However, pay at the pump also offers fleet card holders the ability to pay with their fleet card and other, accurate qualifications such as a Driver or Vehicle ID number. Inside the convenience store: The consumer presents their card to the PIN Pad/Payment terminal card reader (wave, tap, or insert). The PIN pad sends the payment information either to the POS system or directly to the Electronic Payment Server (EPS), which then sends the payment information to the payment processor / acquirer. Outside at the fuel island: The consumer presents their card to the fuel dispenser card reader (wave, tap, or insert). The card reader sends the payment information to the fuel/site controller, which then sends the payment information to the EPS, which then sends the payment information to the payment processor / acquirer. For this scenario, risks to card data are present at above. Risks explained on next page.

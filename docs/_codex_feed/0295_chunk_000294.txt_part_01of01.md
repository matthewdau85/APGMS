should be made assuming that the user data are contained in horizontally oriented AOI rectangles sized at 0.250 inch (top to bottom) and having a length equal to the line length for each field, but not including the line.

The scan readable data, which may be pre-printed, and/or printed/handwritten at the time of document issue, includes the name of the Financial Institution on which the document (cheque) is drawn, domicile, drawer's name, payee, date, dollar sign, amount in figures, amount in words and signature/s. These areas are designated as “Areas Of Interest” (AOI) as they contain vital information pertaining to the document being imaged. The minimum PCS of each of these data elements shall be 0.60 with respect to its immediate surrounding background. Printing of these data elements may be done with black and other ink colours, as long as the minimum PCS value is maintained. Paragraph amended, effective 28/06/04 Table 2 illustrates the relationship between background reflectance and the reflectance of printed data to obtain a PCS of 0.60. To improve readability of hand-written information with respect to the document background Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 19 AusPayNet September 2017 the use of pens with medium writing tips, and the use of black or blue-black ink is recommended. To assist with scanning, it is recommended that document backgrounds be designed to attain the highest reflectance (while being mindful of the need to have sufficient ink coverage and depth of colour to hinder fraudulent alteration), and the printing for specified data elements be the lowest practical reflectance consistent with producing documents exceeding the minimum requirements. Paragraph amended (editorial changes), effective 28/06/04 Table 2 When Background Reflectance is: The Maximum Reflectance of Printed Data is: 60% 24.0% 65% 26.0% 70% 28.0% 75% 30.0% 80% 32.0% 85% 34.0% 1.5.6 Security In an image processing system many documents will not be scrutinised by human eye in their original form before being processed, and may not even be viewed on an image screen when recognition determines the amount correctly. In many cases, no scrutiny of the item will occur at all. Therefore, the need for automatic fraud protection becomes stronger with imaging. Not all security features are compatible with digital imaging systems. Security designs which are “Image Compatible” are expected to preserve legibility and yield acceptable compressed image storage. Security features which utilise high contrast fine line structures usually cause marginal image data element legibility and large storage requirements. Document designers should use caution in evaluating/selecting from among the variety of security printing features available (refer Section 6), paying attention to the reflectance and PCS of the background which surrounds any of the data elements as defined in this standard. Many security processes may contradict low PCS requirements for the background within the areas of interest. In general, some security printing features do not perform well with image technology. For example, a cheque using a security pantograph, when imaged, usually shows a hidden image just as intended on a photocopy. Some imaging scanners will cause the hidden image to appear on a particular document while others will not. The hidden image must not intrude into the Amount in Figure and its Protection Area, and it is preferred that a hidden image does not intrude into any AOI. Some security features will still require manual inspection or scrutiny since image technology will not provide adequate representation in the digitised image. For example, the use of multi- coloured backgrounds or micro-printing may not be detectable in the resulting image.

Cheques 2.1 Types of Cheques 2.1.1 Customer Cheques Supplied by Financial Institutions Amended, effective 13/09/11 These cheques are usually supplied in book form and are often of the size 2 9/16" x 6 1/4" (64mm x 159mm). They are normally personalised with the name of the customer printed on them. 2.1.2 Specially Printed Cheques Amended, effective 19/05/08 These cheques are usually used by companies and businesses, can be designed to show the customer's name, customer logo and/or brand. The layout of these cheques is usually designed to suit accounting software packages to aid machine printing or computer infilling and may be printed in either cut-sheet or continuous form, see also Section 5. The positioning of the details is in many cases determined by the requirements of the particular equipment or software package used. Australia Post’s requirements for the

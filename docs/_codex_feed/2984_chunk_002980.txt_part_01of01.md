perform penetration testing as part of its own PCI DSS assessment to demonstrate separation of client networks, in order to aid Customers in meeting this requirement. These should include tests between Provider management nodes and Customer systems, and between Customers on shared infrastructure. This testing should be used to verify that adequate restrictive network controls are in place to segregate the environments (e.g., assessing the effectiveness of the restricted network controls implemented at the security groups/firewall or ACLs).

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 42 6.5.4 Notification of Testing Given the dynamic nature of the cloud, the shared environments in which vulnerability management testing must be conducted and the cooperative relationship of Providers and Customers, it may be necessary to provide notice and obtain prior permission before attempting certain testing activities. Notification may include anticipated testing dates, types of testing and details such as IP address range(s) affected. It is also important for the Customer to understand what testing activities are permitted by the Provider, and ensure that such activities do not harm other Customers within the environment. Any such constraints should be detailed in the Service Contracts, Terms of Service or Acceptable Use policy.

There will of course be exceptions and variations across each individual service, and this table is provided as a guideline for Customers and Providers to help plan discussions and negotiations. The descriptions in this table are intended to reflect the Provider’s responsibilities with respect to the services it provides, and do not consider the Provider’s responsibilities for its internal infrastructure and operations not directly involved in providing services to their Customers. Similarly, Customer responsibilities do not include consideration for the Customer systems used to access the cloud service, or for any Customer systems in scope for PCI DSS that are outside the cloud service. PCI DSS Requirements Common Considerations Example Responsibility Assignment for Management of Controls IaaS PaaS SaaS Requirement 1: Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data. IaaS: Typically, network security is a shared responsibility: The Customer is responsible for securing networks within and between its own environments, while the Provider provides network security at the cloud perimeter and between the Provider’s Customers. The Provider manages firewalls on the Provider-managed network and any infrastructure firewalls not visible to the Customer. Any firewalls above the infrastructure layer may be the responsibility of the Customer. The Provider-managed firewalls could also be shared by multiple Customers. PaaS: Firewalls above the infrastructure layer may be the responsibility of the Customer or Provider. The Customer could be directly responsible for implementing and managing firewalls on the provided platform, or it may define firewall configurations, which the Provider then implements for the Customer’s environment. The Provider-managed firewalls could also be shared with other Customers. SaaS: The network is wholly owned and managed by the Provider, and consequently all firewall functions are typically managed by the Provider. In all scenarios, the Customer may still need to define, approve and periodically review the services, protocols, and ports permitted into its environment, even if the Provider is managing the firewalls in question.

IaaS: Secure configuration of OS and applications is typically the responsibility of the Customer, while secure configuration of underlying devices is the responsibility of the Provider. There may also be virtual devices that the Customer is responsible for maintaining. PaaS: The OS is often controlled by the Provider, but some services may include a level of Customer access to the OSboth parties will need to clarify which entity is applying secure configuration and hardening at the OS level. Applications and software above the OS are likely to be controlled by the Customer. Secure configuration of network devices will be managed by the Provider. SaaS: The Provider typically manages configuration and hardening of all devices, OS and applications. Customer and Provider Customer and Provider Provider Requirement 3: Protect stored cardholder data. IaaS and PaaS: The Customer is generally responsible for the manner in which information is secured (such as the use of encryption mechanisms) and in what formatfor example, flat files, database entries, etc. Physical locations of the information stores might be unknown to the Customer, and storage locations may need to be identified. Data retention is defined by the Customer; however, the Provider controls the actual storage areas. The use of controls to prevent unintended or additional retention (for example,

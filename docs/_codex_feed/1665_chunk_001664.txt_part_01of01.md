The Australian Cash Distribution & Exchange System (ACDES) provides rules for the exchange and distribution of wholesale cash. This includes buying, selling and packaging of notes and coins, audit requirements and cash movements. ACDES members own and manage their own cash reserves. Working closely with the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Royal Australian Mint, they largely supply the community with the notes and coins needed to carry out daily economic activity.

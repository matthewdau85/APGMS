scope for PCI DSS. (see the PCI SSC Information Supplement, Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation). The devices will need to be securely configured and patched. Any remote access must be configured as per PCI DSS requirements. The connection to the payment service provider must be secured. Finally, the SBC and the DTMF devices must be correctly configured to ensure that no DTMF bleed occurs. It is recommended to include a regular review of the signal to validate the efficiency of the DTMF solution. Diagram 8: On-premises deployment of DTMF masking 6.4.2 Unattended Telephony Technologies In an unattended transaction, the agent is not in contact with the customer for the entirety of the call. Technologies used for unattended transactions are often referred to as IVR (interactive voice response) applications or automated call-handling solutions. In this scenario, the agent typically switches the call to the IVR or call-handling solution for the duration of time needed to communicate the payment details. Depending on the technology used, the transmission of account data could be either by voice (the Information Supplement • Protecting Telephone-Based Payment Card Data • November 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 36 customer speaks the account data), or by DTMF (the customer uses their telephone keypad to input the account data). The IVR or call-handling solution may be part of the entity’s own telephone environment or be located at a third party, such as a PSP or acquirer. The technology may also provide the customer with an option to return back to an agent and re-establish voice contact after payment is complete, or during the transaction in the event that the payment is unsuccessful. In all instances, the intent of these solutions is to bypass the agent when account data is transmitted, thus avoiding any exposure of account data to the agent. Moreover, DTMF suppression and DTMF masking, described in the previous section, can also be used to reduce the presence of account data in systems such as call-recording solutions. When properly implemented, an unattended transaction solution could reduce applicability of PCI DSS requirements to the agent and agent desktop environment. However, it would first need to be verified that PAN and SAD bypass the agent environment, and neither the agent nor the agent desktop environment have the ability to access or retrieve account data. 6.5 Other Common Forms of Scope Reduction 6.5.1 Pause-and-Resume The goal of pause-and-resume technologies is to prevent account data being recorded by temporarily halting the recording during the communication of account data and resuming the recording only when all payment data transmissions are complete. Pause-and-resume technologies may be manual or automated, and whilst a properly implemented pause-and-resume solution could reduce applicability of PCI DSS by taking the call-recording and storage systems out of scope, the technology does not reduce PCI DSS applicability to the agent, the agent desktop environment, or any other systems in the telephone environment as shown in the Diagram 9 on the following page.

Common challenges with manual pause-and-resume include:  The agent forgetting to pause the recording at the right time, resulting in the unintended capture of CHD and potentially SAD. Entities are encouraged to ask their call center operator how they remove SAD from recordingspreferably automatically (with no manual intervention by your staff).  The agent forgetting to restart the recording after the transaction, resulting in a breach of regional or local legal requirements and in loss of other data that may have been of value to the business. Manual pause-and-resume implementations require constant monitoring and verification that the manual processes are being followed by all agents for every transaction. As well as monitoring agent processes, the entity will need to regularly confirm that the call recorder and call storage do not contain any CHD or SAD. This can be achieved by supervisors regularly listening to recorded conversations. The degree of oversight and supervision required for manual solutions is much greater than for automated solutions.

In an automated pause-and-resume solution, the agent no longer has the burden of remembering to manually stop and restart the recording, as the solution will automatically perform this function as part of a predefined step during the transaction process. For example, the technology could set the recording to automatically pause when the agent clicks on a payment-entry field or launches a payment screen within the application, and automatically resume when the agent clicks “submit” or moves to the next screen in the application. The effectiveness of an automated solution relies largely on its integration with the agent’s workflow process and the agent performing the correct steps at the correct time.

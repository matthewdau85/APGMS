Guidelines for Companies Intending to Issue MICR Encoded Cheques September 2017 Guidelines for Companies Intending to Issue MICR Encoded Cheques P a g e | 2 AusPayNet September 2017 This document provides an overview of the approval process and requirements associated with the printing of the MICR codeline. Cheques and deposit forms are Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) encoded to facilitate processing by imaging, reading and sorting equipment used by financial institutions. If you’re considering producing your own MICR encoded documents, you must have your financial institution’s approval. Company cheques are valuable: lack of care can lead to misuse resulting in potentially disastrous fraud losses. Following these Guidelines will help to eliminate cheque fraud.

Document amended on September 2017 for the re-branding of AusPayNet to AusPaynet September 2017 Guidelines for Companies Intending to Issue MICR Encoded Cheques P a g e | 3 AusPayNet September 2017 Introduction Issuing and MICR encoding cheques is the process of overprinting the security background of base stock cheque paper with the cheque format, other personalisation details and the MICR codeline. This document:  Is intended for companies, and other parties seeking to issue MICR encoded documents using their own computer software which will be printed on a MICR enabled printer.  Emphasises the need for Security Control Procedures.  Provides some guidelines for paper handling, to optimise the performance of your laser printing system; and  Should be read in conjunction with and does not replace the specifications contained in AusPayNet Publications “Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms” and “Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Technical Specifications” or their subsequent replacements. Both publications can be downloaded from the www.auspaynet.com.au website, or are available from AusPayNet on request. Printing of the MICR codeline is only one aspect of issuing cheques and deposit forms. For an overview of the processes involved in purchasing and using specially printed cheques, refer to "AusPayNet Guidelines for the Purchase and Use of Specially Printed Cheques". What approvals do I need? To print the MICR codeline on cheques and deposit forms, you have to:  Obtain a Printer Identifier number from AusPayNet; and  Get your financial institution’s approval. Obtaining Your Printer Identifier All organisations that MICR encode cheques and/or deposit forms must be listed with AusPayNet and allocated a Printer Identifier. You will need the Printer Identifier AusPayNet assigns when you apply for printing approval from your financial institution. You can download a copy of the Printer Identifier Registration Form from the www.auspaynet.com.au website, or contact AusPayNet. Financial Institution Approvals You need to provide your Financial Institution with sample cheques that have been MICR encoded by your system to ensure that they meet the standard for MICR outlined in “Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Technical Specifications” If the samples are acceptable, your Financial Institution will allocate a Design Approval Number (DAN) and Printing Approval Number (PAN) and issue you a Confirmatory Authority giving you permission to start printing and MICR encoding your own cheques. Guidelines for Companies Intending to Issue MICR Encoded Cheques P a g e | 4 AusPayNet September 2017 For more information about financial institution approval and authorisation processes, refer to Appendix E of “Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms”. MICR Printing Requirements The MICR codeline is used to facilitate high-speed cheque processing by financial institutions. Your financial institution may charge you a fee for MICR encoded documents that cannot be processed by their automated clearing systems. Printing equipment, types of toners, character positioning, formation and alignment have an impact on the efficient and accurate processing of MICR encoded documents. Printing Equipment Printing equipment used to overprint the MICR codeline should be of high standard, capable of producing MICR encoding to the AusPayNet specifications in Section 3 of Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Technical Specifications. Toner The MICR codeline must be overprinted using specialised magnetic toners, to optimise cheque processing. Use MICR toner that is recommended by the manufacturer for the printing system. MICR Overlays and Test Equipment The quality of the MICR on cheques you print is your responsibility. Your Financial Institution may charge you to process poor quality MICR that cannot be processed by the automated clearing system. You must therefore ensure that standards are maintained to prevent poor quality cheque printing. There are tools and equipment available that can be used as overlays, or for testing the quality of MICR printing, some of which can be purchased from AusPayNet:  MICR codeline layouts can be used to check the positioning of the MICR codeline on cheques and deposit forms; and  The AusPayNet Position and Layout Gauge allows you to check spacing, skews, format and alignment of MICR characters.  Optical Comparator with a 12x magnification loupe

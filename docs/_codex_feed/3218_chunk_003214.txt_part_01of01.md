9 December 2022 PCI Security Standards Council Bulletin: Expiry Date Extended for PCI PTS POI v4 Devices Due to industry feedback regarding global supply-chain disruptions, the PCI Security Standards Council has changed the expiration date for PIN Transaction Security Point-of-Interaction (PTS POI) version 4 devices from 30 April 2023 to 30 April 2024. Device vendors with a POI v4 listing will be advised directly about the process for the additional year’s listing. For those countries and entities not impacted by supply chain issues, we strongly encourage the use and deployment of next generation solutions such as existing PTS POI v5 or v6 approved devices. While recognizing that earlier versions of POI devices may be less robust in withstanding certain of the latest generations of attacks, we do not believe that this limited one-year extension of the approval expiry date for POI v4 devices will materially impact that risk. The PCI SSC advises merchants, financial institutions, vendors and other users of PTS POI v4 devices, specifically v4 PEDs (PIN entry devices), EPPs (encrypting PIN pads), UPTs (unattended payment terminal), and SCRs (Secure Card Readers) to contact their device vendors regarding the availability of more recently approved models to use as replacements and in new deployments. ###

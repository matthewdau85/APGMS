in transport. 4.2.2 Minimum Key Length for Transport Keys (a) DEA2 keys of less than 2048 bits are to be treated as single use keys and their use is deprecated. (b) DEA2 key lengths of less than 1024-bits are unsuitable for general use. Preferred DEA2 key lengths are equal to or greater than 2048 bits in length and should be used in all new implementations where hardware constraints do not exist. (c) Triple DES (DEA3) may use either 128-bit or 192-bit key sizes. 4.2.3 Key Life Cycle Practices for Transport Keys (a) DEA3 Key Transport Keys are single use keys only. (b) Symmetric Key Transport Keys must be freshly generated to protect keys in transport and then securely destroyed after use. (c) At the time of publication, DEA2 keys of size equal to or in excess of 2048 bits are deemed acceptable for a key change interval (life time) of two (2) years. 4.3 Domain Master Keys (DMK) These keys are used within a financial institution to protect keys stored internal to the organisation. 4.3.1 Minimum Key Length for Domain Master Keys Domain Master Keys must be DEA3 keys with a minimum length of 128-bits (112 effective). IAC CODE SET VOLUME 4 - DEVICE REQUIREMENTS AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT PART 4 CRYPTOGRAPHIC STANDARDS AND KEY MANAGEMENT Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 10 4.4 IAC Interchange Cryptographic Keys19 4.4.1 Introduction Interchange keys are used to protect financial Transactions initiated at Acquirer Terminals while in transit to the Issuer institution. Interchange keys may be either: (a) PIN encrypting keys – used to protect the customer PIN from the point of origin to the point of authorisation. PIN encrypting keys are a specific instance of session keys; (b) Message authentication keys – used to ensure message integrity. Message authentication keys are a specific instance of session keys; (c) Data Protection Keys – used to provide confidentiality of messages. Data protection keys are a specific instance of session keys; (d) Session keys – used to secure, validate and protect the financial message. Session keys can be further qualified into those used in the Terminal to Acquirer environment (Terminal session keys) or on node to node links (interchange session keys); (e) Key Encrypting Keys (KEK)– used to protect other keys (e.g., session keys) during exchange; or (f) Transport Keys – used to protect keys (e.g., KEKs) during transport to the partner institution. 4.4.1 Cryptographic Algorithms (a) DEA3 and DEA2 are the only approved algorithms for the protection of interchange information (full details of these algorithms may be found in the Australian standards AS 2805.5.4 and AS 2805.5.3 respectively). (b) DEA3 keys are 128 bits in length (effectively 112 bits) and are generally referred to as triple DES or 3DES keys (the corresponding encryption algorithm is specified in AS 2805.5.4). Triple DES may also be acceptably implemented using a key length of 192 bits (effectively 168 bits). (c) DEA3 with a key length of 128 bits and DEA2 with key lengths equal to, or greater than 2048 bits are the minimum acceptable requirements for the effective protection of interchange information at the time of the issuance of this document. (d) In accordance with AS 2805.3.1, DEA3 must be used for PIN encipherment. Acquirers who do not comply with this requirement are responsible for any Issuer loss (direct or indirect) arising from the compromise of PIN data due to a breach of this requirement.20 19 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 20 Amended effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 4 - DEVICE REQUIREMENTS AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT PART 4 CRYPTOGRAPHIC STANDARDS AND KEY MANAGEMENT Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 11 4.5 IAC Interchange Links21 4.5.1 IAC Interchange Security Requirements22 For all IAC Interchange Links, Issuers and Acquirers must ensure that: 23 (a) security for Transactions processed over that IAC Interchange Link complies with: AS 2805.6 series;24 (b) security for Transactions from Terminal to Acquirer and from Acquirer to Issuer complies with: AS 2805.6 series; (c) PIN security and encryption complies with AS 2805. 3.1 and clause 4.8 of this IAC Code Set Volume 4;25 (d) Key management practices comply with AS 2805.6.1; (e) Message Authentication must apply to all IAC Interchange Links;26 (f) The Message Authentication Code (MAC) must be calculated using, as a minimum, a DEA 3 (128-bit) key, Triple-DES and an algorithm conforming to AS 2805.4.1; and (g) all interchange PIN and MAC cryptographic functions must be performed within an SCM that is an Approved Device.27 4.5.2 Key Management Practices – IAC Interchange Links28 Clause 4.5.2 is Confidential 21 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 22 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 23 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 24 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 25 Amended effective 29/4/16, version 003 r&p 001.16 26 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 27 Amended effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 28 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 4 - DEVICE REQUIREMENTS AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT PART 4 CRYPTOGRAPHIC STANDARDS AND KEY MANAGEMENT Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 12 4.6 KEK Establishment 4.6.1 Introduction (a) The security of Interchange is critically dependent on the secure installation of the Interchange Key Encrypting Keys. It is critically important that safe, sound and secure practices be adopted for the generation, handling, transport, storage and installation of interchange Key

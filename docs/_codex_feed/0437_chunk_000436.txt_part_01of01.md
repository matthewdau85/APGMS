the same laws which govern the interpretation of the Articles. 1.4 Copyright Copyright in these Procedures is vested in the Company. The next page is Part 2 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES PART 2: EFFECT Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 20 PART 2 EFFECT (a) These Procedures have the effect set out in Part 2 of the Regulations. (b) The provisions of these Procedures apply to the Framework known or referred to as the domestic high value clearing system but only with respect to payment instructions sent and received electronically using the SWIFT PDS. (c) The HVCS Procedures consist of two volumes:93 (i) This Volume 1, which applies to participation in the HVCS MT CUG; and (ii) Volume 2, which applies to participation in the HVCS ISO 20022 CUG for the processing of MX messages.94 (d) Participation in the HVCS requires participation in both CUGs, and therefore adherence to both volumes of the Procedures. Neither volume can be relied upon in isolation. There is no hierarchy or precedence between the two volumes. Volume 1 applies to the processing of MT format messages. Volume 2 applies to the processing of MX messages. Both Volumes contain a Part 9 relating to contingency processing and associated contingency instructions in an annexure to each volume. Both sets of procedures and instructions must be considered together.95 (e) Whilst Volume 1 describes the full use of MT messages, MT messages may only be used in the HVCS MT CUG in one situation: by an intermediary to on-send the domestic leg of an inward cross border MT payment. Any other use of MT messages in the HVCS MT CUG is strictly prohibited and will be deemed a breach of the Procedures and dealt with accordingly. This constraint takes precedence over any other described usage in both volumes of the HVCS Procedures.96 The next page is Part 3 93 Inserted effective 14/11/22, version 041 r&p 001.22 94 Amended effective 23/9/24, version 044 r&p 001.24 95 Amended effective 23/9/24, version 044 r&p 001.24 96 Inserted effective 23/9/24, version 044 r&p 001.24 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES PART 3: PROCEDURES AND AMENDMENT Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 21 PART 3 PROCEDURES AND AMENDMENT 3.1 Conduct of Clearings Pursuant to Regulation 11.1 and in addition to and subject to the Regulations, the sending and receipt of payment instructions by Framework Participants must comply with the applicable practices, procedures, standards and specifications contained in these Procedures. 3.2 Amendments (a) These Procedures may be varied by the Management Committee in accordance with Regulation 11.3 and Clause 3.2(b) of these Procedures. Any variation to these Procedures must contain an editorial note setting out the effective date of such variation. (b) Each Framework Participant must notify the Company of any changes to its contact points as specified in Annexure C.1, C.2 and C.3. The Chief Executive Officer may vary Annexure C.1, C.2 and C.3 in accordance with such notification without the need to obtain the approval of the Management Committee or any other person. A variation made by the Chief Executive Officer pursuant to this Clause 3.2(b) will, upon publication by the Company, be binding on that Framework Participant and each other Framework Participant. 3.3 Inconsistency With Other Applicable Rules and Regulations (a) Some of the provisions of these Procedures refer to or reflect the requirements of SWIFT in relation to the SWIFT PDS or the requirements of the Reserve Bank of Australia in relation to RITS. Those requirements of SWIFT or the Reserve Bank of Australia might change from time to time.97 (b) Subject to this Clause 3.3(b), if any provision of these Procedures is inconsistent with any mandatory provision of the SWIFT User Handbook, the provision in the SWIFT User Handbook prevails to the extent of that inconsistency. However, any provision of these Procedures which: (i) deals with the same subject as any provision of the SWIFT User Handbook, and (ii) imposes on any Framework Participant more rigorous obligations in relation to that subject than does that provision of the SWIFT User Handbook, or removes or limits any discretion that may have been available under or in accordance with that provision of the SWIFT User Handbook in relation to that subject, or imposes additional obligations to those imposed by that provision of the SWIFT User Handbook in relation to that subject, and 97 Last amended effective 1/1/18, version 037 r&p 001.17 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES PART 3: PROCEDURES AND AMENDMENT Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 22 (iii) can be performed without breaching that other provision of the SWIFT User Handbook, is not to be construed as inconsistent with, and accordingly prevails over, that other provision of the SWIFT User Handbook. (c) Any provision of these Procedures which restates terms or conditions applicable to, or which otherwise covers, operation of RITS is included for information purposes only and is not, by virtue of these Procedures only, binding under these Procedures. Framework Participants should refer to the RITS Regulations for the terms and conditions of operation of RITS.98 (d) Framework Participants should, therefore, be conversant with the relevant provisions of both the SWIFT User Handbook and RITS Regulations.

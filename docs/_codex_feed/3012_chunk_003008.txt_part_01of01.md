understand and implement the extra PCI DSS security controls that are required to protect their systems. The Direct Post Method uses the merchant’s website to generate the shopping cart and payment web pages. The merchant’s payment form, loaded in the customer’s browser, sends the cardholder data directly to the PSP—not via the merchant’s website or systems—ensuring cardholder data is not stored, processed, or transmitted via the merchant systems. However, the payment form is provided by the merchant; therefore, the merchant’s systems are in scope for additional PCI DSS controls, which are necessary to protect the merchant website against malicious individuals changing the form and capturing cardholder data. Information Supplement • Best Practices for Securing E-commerce • April 2017 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 14 2.3.2 The Direct Post process 1. The merchant’s website creates the payment page. 2. The customer’s browser displays the payment page and sends cardholder data directly to the PSP. 3. The PSP receives the cardholder data and sends it to the payment system for authorization.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 15 2.3.3 Merchant Impact As account data is not stored, processed, or transmitted on the merchant’s e-commerce systems, a subset of security controls is required to protect the web server and, in particular, the payment form due to the merchant’s control over the manner in which cardholder data is collected and transmitted to the PSP. Because of this, there is an associated security effort, such as network and firewall security, secure software development, vulnerability scanning/penetration testing, and vulnerability and patch management. For a full list of requirements, please see the applicable SAQ. Merchants using a Direct Post e-commerce implementation may be eligible for PCI SAQ A-EP, providing they meet the eligibility criteria of that SAQ. Merchants should consult with their acquirer (merchant bank) or with the payment brands directly to determine whether they are required to validate their PCI DSS compliance and which reporting method they should use. SAQ A-EP for PCI DSS v3.2 currently includes 191 requirements. 2.3.4 Recommendations This architecture may be suitable for e-commerce implementations where the merchant prefers more control over the website look and feel and is comfortable with the additional responsibility for securing its website. The organization’s appetite for payment-card data risk and PCI DSS scope may require avoidance of a fully merchant managed solution. The Direct Post Method has a higher security responsibility for and higher risk of merchant system compromise than the URL redirect or iFrame methods, as the merchant’s web server controls the payment form, which is often a target for criminals. More PCI DSS requirements apply to the Direct Post Method than the URL redirect and iFrame methods. Increased security is required to protect the website and its code, raising operational and audit costs for the merchant; however, this needs to be balanced against the design and use benefits of merchant- created forms. It is recommended additional security controls above those required by PCI DSS be implemented. 2.4 JavaScript Form 2.4.1 What is a JavaScript Form? Similar to the Direct Post Method, the JavaScript payment page originates from the merchant’s website and requests the customer’s browser execute JavaScript code from the PSP to create the payment form. Entered cardholder data is then sent directly to the PSP in the same way as the Direct Post Method. Also similar to the Direct Post Method, a JavaScript form is generally used by larger merchants that require more control over their payment form look and feel and are able to understand and implement the extra PCI DSS security controls that are required to protect their systems.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 16 2.4.2 The JavaScript Form process 1. Merchant website creates the payment page. 2. Payment page on the customer’s browser requests JavaScript from the PSP. 3. The PSP creates JavaScript and sends to customer’s browser. 4. The customer’s browser uses JavaScript to create the payment form within the payment page. 5. The customer completes payment by entering payment details into the form, which is sent directly to the PSP. 6. The PSP receives cardholder data and sends to payment system for authorization.

Merchants using a JavaScript e-commerce implementation may be eligible for PCI SAQ A-EP, providing they meet the eligibility criteria of that SAQ. Merchants should consult with their acquirer (merchant bank) or with the payment brands directly to determine whether they are required to validate their PCI DSS compliance and

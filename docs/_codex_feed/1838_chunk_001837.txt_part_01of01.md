#COLLABNPP May-July 2018 NPP Australia is interested in collaborating with RegTech organisations to explore potential opportunities for developing innovative compliance related overlays on the NPP. For example, the monitoring and screening of domestic electronic account to account transaction in a real-time environment requires advanced monitoring, screening, reporting and systems. At the same time, there is a constant need to refine, adapt and advance tools and capabilities that can identify and respond to fraud and scams, which are always evolving. The opportunities could be in either sanctions screening or fraud, or they may be in other compliance related areas where a RegTech organisation feels that there is an opportunity to enhance current compliance processes and capabilities. Launched at the #ACCELERATE RegTech conference on May 4, #COLLABNPP is a structured market engagement over a three month period to enable interested RegTech organisations the opportunity to learn more about the NPP, gain a greater technical understanding of how the Platform works and to engage with some of the financial institutions who are participating in the NPP. How #COLLABNPP works: By May 11: Register your interest Organisations wishing to register for #COLLABNPP can email [email protected] by May 11. You’ll be required to read and agree to our terms and conditions by signing our registration form. Week commencing May 21: Technical workshop A #COLLABNPP technical workshop with registered organisations will be held the week commencing May 21 enabling a further deep dive into the technical workings of the NPP. This will occur in Sydney and provide participating RegTech organisations further information to consider how they could develop their own solutions for the NPP. Week commencing June 4: Q&A call Following a period of time which participating organisations would have explored their own thinking around the NPP, a teleconference hosted by NPP Australia will then be held during the week commencing June 4 to enable further questions to be asked. The information garnered on the call could assist organisations to refine or fine-tune their own thinking around their potential solution. By Friday, June 22: Submit your proposal Participating organisations that have used the process to progress their thinking or solution, are then invited to submit an initial proposal for a compliance overlay. Early July: Pitch your proposal Organisations that have submitted a proposal will be invited to attend an interactive session with NPP Participants in early July 2018 where they can pitch their solution or idea with a view to making it a commercial reality.

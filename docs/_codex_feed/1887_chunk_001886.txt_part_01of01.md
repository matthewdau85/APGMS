the NPP, there is also a significant opportunity to further enhance current capabilities and processes, drive greater automation and support straight through processing, for the ASX and the wider community. The NPP’s Addressing Service, PayID, enables payments to be directed to an account using an easy to remember alias (a PayID) which has been linked to an underlying bank account. PayIDs can be easily moved from one bank account to another along with all of the associated payments linked to a PayID, which means there is no need to maintain up-to-date details for a customer’s bank account. Currently four alias types are supported on the platform – phone number, email, ABN and an Organisation Identifier, with the ability to add to these over time with new alias types. The Platform also continues to support payments using BSB and account numbers. Future capabilities Additional functionality and capability will be rolled out over time which will further increase the utility of the Platform. Future planned services include the ability to attach a document with a payment or have a url link to externally hosted documents included in the message, “request to pay” functionality and the ability to support recurring payments linked to a customer consent authorising those payments. An NPP API framework (initially focused on payment initiation requests and PayID look ups) is currently under development. This API framework would further assist with interoperability between the two platforms and facilitate the development of securities payment initiation services. How the NPP works There are many similarities and parallels between how the NPP works as underlying infrastructure and what the ASX is seeking to achieve through its CHESS replacement plans. The NPP is a distributed architecture of customised payment gateways which are hosted by financial institutions who have chosen to connect directly. Payment transactions are processed and routed between the NPP payment gateways and the RBA’s Fast Settlement Service using the ISO 20022 message structure. The Platform has very high levels of availability and resilience, with the NPP payment gateways being required to respond to messages within seconds. The Fast Settlement Service is a new service of the Reserve Bank Information and Transfer System (RITS) specifically supporting settlement of NPP payments. The Fast Settlement Service provides line-by-line settlement of individual settlement requests received via the NPP payment gateways, validating each request against the paying Exchange Settlement Account Holder’s balance. Settlement then occurs irrevocably and unconditionally. Organisations who want to be able to send instructions to initiate NPP payments can choose to connect directly via an NPP payment gateway, housed in their own environment. The ASX has the option of considering becoming an NPP “Connected Institution” which would bring certain associated benefits of security, performance, direct access to the PayID Addressing Service for PayID resolutions and the ability to send messages directly to all connected NPP participating financial institutions. Overlay Services sit on top of the Platform’s infrastructure to offer different or tailored customer value propositions. Osko, developed by BPAY, is the first Overlay Service and was made available to customers when the NPP launched to the public in 2018. The ability to support multiple products and services makes the Platform flexible, extensible and well positioned to support payment needs into the future. The NPP’s approach to overlays is similar in nature to the ASX’s intention to provide tools for external parties to develop applications and services to leverage the CHESS replacement platform and functionality. Overview of NPP architecture How the NPP can support the new CHESS Replacement features The NPP can provide the ASX with real-time payment facilities and has the capabilities required to support the CHESS replacement plan in the following key areas which will drive significant processing and efficiency benefits: Settlement – Non-batch DvP bilateral settlement Corporate Actions – Electronic acceptance and payment of entitlement offers mFund – Sharing investor details, automation of regular payments and switching between funds Settlement – Non-batch DvP bilateral settlement With line-by-line, real-time settlement via the Reserve Bank’s Fast Settlement Service, the Platform eliminates settlement risks by supporting payments any time of the day, any day of the year with no cut off times. Payments are not delayed because of defined batch settlement times and can be settled after business hours or during weekends. With no value limits imposed across the infrastructure, the NPP can support transactions of any value. By using common ISO 20022 messaging, the NPP can easily integrate CHESS specific data and carry that data through the payment messages to improve efficiency, reconciliation and support straight through processing. Finally, the fact that significant numbers of ASX Payment Providers are also already participating in the NPP, and NPP’s open access architecture, presents an opportunity to realise synergies between the two platforms. Corporate Actions – Electronic acceptance and payment of entitlement offers With its real-time payment and data rich capabilities, the NPP can be used by the ASX to deliver an automated electronic process for the acceptance and payment of entitlements, which will generate considerable operational improvements for the ASX and its stakeholders. Transactions can occur in a more timely manner (effectively with no settlement risk), reconciliation effort will be reduced and the quality of data will be enhanced. Interoperability between CHESS and NPP through ISO20022 messaging means detailed entitlement acceptance data can be passed across the infrastructure alongside the payment. This provides the holder’s settlement participant and the issuer with the ability to easily reconcile payment with

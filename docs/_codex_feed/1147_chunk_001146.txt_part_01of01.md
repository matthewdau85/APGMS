With the constant threats to payment security globally, it’s important, now more than ever, that we help secure the future of payments together. Although we will not be together face-to-face, we will still gather virtually to hear important Council updates, regional insights and are creating an engaging agenda for this one-day virtual event. We will provide you with the information and tools to help secure payment data. Everyone in the global payments community is encouraged to join us for this great opportunity.

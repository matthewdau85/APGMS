of the relative signal strength are 75% to 200% of the nominal. Where a mis-printed or otherwise unwanted character is removed the residual signal level after removal must not exceed 5% of the relative signal strength of that character. 2.2.11 Permanence Permanence is defined as the ability of MICR printed characters to retain their ability to be read magnetically and optically over the working life of the document. This requires that documents meet the specifications contained within this publication at all times during normal processing by Financial Institutions. This is of importance with impact ribbon and non-impact printing where flaking and abrasion may occur if the print is not properly adhered or fused to the paper. 2.2.12 Other Printing Factors Anti-set off spray must not be used for printing MICR documents as it adversely affects Financial Institutions’ reader/sorter equipment. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 22 AusPayNet September 2017 The use of additives to facilitate the drying of magnetic ink should only be used after advice from the ink manufacturer, as such driers may affect the signal strength of the print. 2.3 Document Format Specifications 2.3.1 Size of Documents The minimum and maximum dimensions of the document, excluding butts and other attachments, must be within the following limits: Length 6 1/4 inch (159 mm) up to 8 1/4 inch (210 mm) Height: 2 9/16" (64 mm) up to 3 2/3" (93 mm ) Amended, effective 13/09/11 2.3.2 Reference Edges All dimensions are to be measured from the relevant reference edge. For horizontal measurements, this is the right-hand edge when viewed from the front of a document. Vertical measurements are similarly related to the bottom edge of a document. The intersection of the reference edges must be a right angle. 2.3.3 MICR Clear Band The MICR clear band is a horizontal band extending 5/8 inch from the bottom reference edge of a document. The band extends the full length of the document. 2.3.4 Optical Clear Band The optical clear band is a rectangle 0.300 inch high located 0.015 inch above the bottom reference edge of the document and extends the full length of the document. It is totally contained within the MICR clear band. 2.3.5 Location within MICR Clear Band The MICR codeline is to be printed so that the bottom edges of characters are ideally 0.24 inch from the bottom reference edge and must be wholly contained within the MICR Print band. The location and formatting of MICR characters within the codeline are outlined in section 3. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 23 AusPayNet September 2017 3 MICR Code line specifications 3. MICR Code Line Specifications The MICR code line contains up to 59 character positions numbered 1 to 59 from right to left. The MICR line is contained within a clear band which is 5/8 inch deep and positioned along the bottom of a document. The MICR line must be in a 1/4-inch strip centred in the 5/8 inch Clear Band. There is a 1/4 inch clear zone at both ends of the code line. The line is read from right to left and thus the first character space, numbered position 1, commences 5/16 ± 1/16 inch from the extreme right-hand edge of a document. The term “opened” also thus refers to the rightmost character in a field, this being the first character read. These layout requirements are shown in Figure 14. The MICR line is grouped into six fields as follows, in order from right to left. These fields are normally separated by a blank (unprinted) position.  Amount  Transaction code  Domestic or Account Number  BSB  Auxiliary Domestic (Serial number/Item count)  Extra Auxiliary Domestic (Agent Number, Auxiliary Serial Number) The positioning of these fields is shown in Figure 14. 3.1.1 Amount Field The amount field is a fixed format field that occupies the extreme right position. Positions 1 to 12 are reserved for this field. The first position, 1, must be opened by an Amount symbol. There are then ten spaces for the amount that must include two positions for the cents (positions 2-3). The dollar amount must be right justified and zero filled to the left. The leftmost position (position 12) must be occupied by a second Amount symbol that closes the field. The responsibility for encoding this field rests with the clearing Financial Institution, not with the printer or issuer. With the advent of Image Capture, this field may not continue to be completed during the proofing process. Figure 15 MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 24 AusPayNet September 2017 MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 25 AusPayNet September 2017 3.1.2 Transaction Code Field Three positions (14-16) are reserved for this optional use field. Position 13 predominantly remains unprinted as a field separator. This field is used to identify the type of transaction taking place, or to indicate the expectation of data in other fields, e.g. the Extra Auxiliary field. When shorter than maximum account numbers are used, Financial Institutions may elect to have the Transaction Code Field printed up to two spaces to the left i.e. positions 16-18. Figure 16 3.1.3 Domestic Field or Account Number Field The account number is printed in this field which normally has 10 positions (18-27). Position 17 will usually be blank as a field separator. The field may be

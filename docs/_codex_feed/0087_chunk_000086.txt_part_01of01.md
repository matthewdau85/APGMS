the interaction and potential constraints between data frameworks and cross-border payments. It was agreed that a dialogue with data privacy experts and authorities could also be beneficial to the FATF’s broader anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) work, going forward. The API Panel of Experts (APEX) Taskforce has commenced its work on looking at API standards and harmonising their usage for cross-border payments. We look forward to the publication of their work over the course of 2024. The recent publication of the FSB’s Annual Progress Report on Meeting the Targets for Cross-Border Payments shows that there is much work to be done and key challenges remain to close off data gaps. With key performance indicators (KPIs) now generally available, industry participants and jurisdictions will be able to start calibrating their responses to deliver on the global targets. The task is significant and resources are finite, but with annual KPIs and jurisdictional commitment, improvements will follow. top Economic crime update Economic Crime Forum (ECF) and the National Anti-Scam Centre (NASC) AusPayNet is represented on the NASC’s Advisory Board and participates in its fusion cell and workgroups. Since its establishment in June 2023, the NASC has brought together all industries in the scam lifecycle to collaborate on prevention and disruption strategies, including the disruption of AI-driven investment scams. Pleasingly, there have been some early indicators of scam loss reduction, however the work of the NASC has also highlighted: The importance of mapping international and domestic mitigation initiatives to assess their effectiveness or unintended consequences That implementing payment holds and blocking of high-risk entities, including certain digital currency exchanges, has reduced scam losses A need for strong onboarding and exchanged customer due diligence, not just in our industry, but across all players within the scam lifecycle A need to review the Privacy Act and ‘tipping off’ provision of the AML/CTF Act , to overcome barriers preventing cross-sectoral collaboration and data sharing to block scams A need for clarity and guidance on the right to deny a transaction A need for ongoing work across government and industry to align and remove complexity or duplication with other related economic crime responses, including cyber-enabled scams. In February 2024, the ECF met in Perth, coinciding with national law enforcement meetings. Law enforcement briefed the Forum on their own priorities for 2024, and the critical importance of payments data in supporting most organised crime investigations today. Since 2023, the payments data evidentiary workgroup has held workshops with all the major banks to assist them in ascertaining how they can more efficiently share important payment data with law enforcement agencies and potentially reduce some of the compliance burden associated with that data sharing. The ECF is progressing through options to create efficiencies in this process for both banks and law enforcement. FY23 payment fraud data On 19 December, AusPayNet released data showing a 35.6% rise in fraud on payment card transactions in the 12 months to 30 June 2023 (FY23), to $677.5 million. Total spending on Australian cards during the same period rose by 15.4% to $1.055 trillion. As a result, the fraud rate for FY23 increased to 64.2 cents per $1,000 spent, up from 54.7 cents in FY22, and returning to nearly the same levels as the pre-pandemic FY19 figure of 66.1 cents per $1,000 spent. In FY23, card-not-present (CNP) fraud constituted 90% of all fraud on payment cards. CNP fraud involving Australian merchants processing Australian cards (domestic CNP fraud), covered under AusPayNet’s CNP Fraud Mitigation Framework, increased by 14% to $313 million, lower than the 26% growth in equivalent CNP spend. This meant that the fraud rate for transactions covered by the CNP Framework actually fell 9%, from $1.21 per $1,000 in FY22 to $1.10 per $1,000 in FY23. The main driver of the increase in the overall fraud rate was CNP fraud on Australian cards used at overseas merchants. While this only accounts for less than 15% of overall spend on Australian cards (according to RBA Payments Statistics), it contributes half of all CNP fraud, and saw an increase in the fraud rate of 16%, from $8.13 per $1,000 spent in FY22 to $9.50 per $1,000 spent in FY23. AusPayNet’s CNP Fraud Mitigation Framework does not cover this fraud, given it involves overseas merchants. More information about the FY23 payment fraud statistics is available on AusPayNet’s website , together with a blog post in which our Head of Economic Crime, Toby Evans, takes a closer look at the data and how industry responds to the activities of fraudsters. top ISO 20022 migration update For a high-level update regarding the progress of the ISO 20022 Industry Migration Program, please refer to the latest issue of Migration Monitor on AusPayNet’s website , published in December 2023. top Stakeholder engagement update Our Stakeholder Advisory Council met in both December 2023 and February 2024. The Council acts as an advisor to our Board, as we continue to seek feedback on important payments issues from non-Member stakeholders of the payments system. In these meetings, we sought Council feedback on: The Government’s payment systems reforms AusPayNet's journey to becoming an authorised standards-setting body AusPayNet’s Corporate Strategy Industry's transition away from the BECS framework The winding down of the cheques system. The Council’s feedback and perspectives were then presented to the Board at its February meeting. Also, in December and January, we continued our Member event series, hosting three virtual Q&A sessions with Treasury teams

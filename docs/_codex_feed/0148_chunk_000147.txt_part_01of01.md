further supports the NASC and law enforcement by sharing insights and risk mitigation techniques, as well as leading public-private projects to assist in disrupting economic crime and seizing ill-gotten gains. It also prioritises tracking and taking down of ‘mule’ accounts used by criminals to launder stolen money. However, we need to remember that criminals are adaptive. In addition to protracted disruption projects, there is a need for real-time data sharing, along with rapid-response fusion cells involving all scam lifecycle participants to support the blocking of new scams as they emerge. This will help harden the ecosystem which, alongside educating consumers and engaging global law enforcement partners to better intercept crimes, will frustrate fraudsters by making scams less cost effective, thereby limiting Australia’s losses. Supporting the criminal justice system’s response In last month’s edition of UN News , the UN noted that, ‘...only such a holistic approach can break the cycle of impunity and ensure protection and justice for the people...’ . A key supporting pillar of the ‘toolbox approach’ is supporting the global criminal justice system’s response to disrupting the ease with which current criminal operations are conducted. The future of modern policing requires a partnership between public and private sectors to tackle limitations like resourcing, globalisation, and the sheer volume of economic crime. There needs to be a collective, global effort to improve transnational information sharing and partnerships to deliver real action. Disruption through individual arrests is not enough on its own, but not acting has dire consequences. Victims also deserve justice. Government and law enforcement need to be able to take advantage of the rich data, expertise, and preventative and technological controls available in the private sector, particularly in the banking and payments industries. AusPayNet and the ECF are already supporting collaboration across the ecosystem to address vulnerabilities within the scam lifecycle and working with the government to develop national codes and enhanced minimum standards. But while these initiatives are effective mitigants, they won’t stop scams alone. There’s no one silver bullet that will prevent economic crime, but a global collaborative ‘toolbox approach’ is an urgently needed step in the right direction.

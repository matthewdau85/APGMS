PayID and Confirmation of Payee are services from AP+ that can help reduce mistaken payments and scams. A PayID is a unique identifier linked to a bank account that makes sending and receiving money easy. Instead of using a BSB and account number, you can use a PayID, such as a mobile number, email address or ABN. When you send money to a PayID, you’ll see the name of the person or business it’s linked to, helping ensure your money goes to the right place. Confirmation of Payee works with BSB and account numbers. It checks the account name, BSB, and account number you’ve entered against the details held by the recipient’s bank details and displays a match outcome. Both services add a layer of security to payments made in your online banking.

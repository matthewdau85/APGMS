Program. Only those QSA Companies and QSA Employees qualified by PCI SSC and included in the QSA List or Website search tool (as applicable) are recognized by PCI SSC to perform PCI DSS Assessments. Associate QSA Employees may assist in the performance of PCI DSS Assessments as further described in this document. 6.1 Requalification All QSA Companies must be requalified regionally by PCI SSC on an annual basis. The annual QSA Company requalification date is based upon the QSA Company’s original qualification date (on a per- region basis). QSA Company requalification requires payment of annual training and regional requalification fees, as well as continued compliance with applicable QSA Requirements. Each Assessor-Employee (QSA Employee and Associate QSA Employee, as applicable) must be requalified by PCI SSC on an annual basis. The annual requalification date is based upon the Assessor-Employee’s previous qualification date. Assessor-Employee requalification requires proof of applicable Continuing Professional Education (CPE), proof of training successfully completed, and payment of annual training fees. Note: Negative feedback from Customers (merchants, service providers, etc.), PCI SSC, Participating Payment Brands, or others may impact the QSA Company’s and/or Assessor- Employee’s eligibility for requalification. For example, a one-year requalification for a certification with a current qualification date of 15 November 2017 will be changed to 15 November 2018 upon successful completion regardless of whether the requalification was completed on 31 October 2017 or 25 November 2017. 6.1.1 Requalification Timeframe In an effort to help ensure adequate time to complete requalification requirements, Assessor- Employees should note: Note: The QSA certification is a requirement for other program certifications such as PA-DSS and P2PE.

Page 8 1052300.5  Registration for requalification training must be completed (and approved, where applicable) prior to the Assessor-Employee’s qualification expiration date. A candidate who is not registered prior to that expiry date must re-enroll as a new candidate.  A two-week grace period is provided beyond the candidate’s expiry date in order to complete requalification training; however candidates will not be qualified by PCI SSC during this time and will not be requalified until the requalification exam is successfully completed.  Access to the course and requalification exam will be granted only after payment is processed, and candidates will have access to the exam at most four weeks prior and two weeks past their expiration date.  If a candidate is enrolled for requalification training and fails to take the training within the defined period, payment will be forfeited in full and the individual will need to reapply as a new QSA Employee (or AQSA, as applicable) candidate. 6.2 Associate QSA Program The goal of the Associate QSA Program is to provide a path to enable QSA Companies to develop new resources into fully qualified QSA Employees, through formal mentorship and monitored skills development. Associate QSA Employees are qualified by PCI SSC to support QSA Employees on PCI DSS Assessments. Refer to Section 3.3 of the QSA Qualification Requirements for more details on entry-level requirements for AQSAs. Note: PCI SSC does not qualify Associate QSA Employees to support any standard other than the PCI DSS. An Associate QSA Employee is able to apply to become a fully qualified QSA Employee once they meet the requirements and have obtained the necessary Industry Certification(s) as stated in Section 3.2 of the QSA Qualification Requirements. It is not necessary for an Associate QSA Employee to retake the QSA Employee training and exam in the same year they qualify as a QSA Employee. There is no requirement regarding how long an individual must be an Associate QSA Employee before applying to become a QSA Employee. The QSA Company must inform the applicable Customer when an Associate QSA Employee has been assigned to work in connection with the PCI DSS Assessment of that Customer, and what parts of the PCI DSS Assessment the Associate QSA Employee will be participating in. The QSA Employee leading a PCI DSS Assessment (the “Lead QSA”) and providing supervision to an Associate QSA Employee: 1. Is responsible for understanding the level of expertise of the Associate QSA Employee and their ability to perform any assigned part of the assessment independently. 2. Is responsible to review all notes and/or evidence collected by the Associate QSA Employee. 3. Is responsible to make the actual compliance determination.

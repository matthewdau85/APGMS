certifications are in place or whether certain physical and logical controls are used by the Provider to protect the physical hardware. The roles and responsibilities for all key management functions when using a cloud SCD must be documented to assure coverage of all requirements, including generating keys of appropriate strength, secure distribution of keys from the SCD and operational policies. It is the responsibility of the Customer to confirm that any applicable hardware requirements are being met by the Provider performing cryptographic functions on its behalf. For instance, PCI DSS specifies an SCD as one way in which a key used for decryption of stored account data at rest should be stored (PCI DSS Requirement 3.5.3). A Customer may meet this requirement using a Provider’s cryptography service only if the Provider is using actual SCD hardware to deliver the service. Similarly, the Provider is also responsible for physical security controls, key storage and distribution procedures, and documented cryptosystem policies. The controls being met by the Provider in the delivery of the compliant service(s) should be clearly identified in the Provider’s AOC and responsibility matrix. 29 The need for unique host keys has been well documented in a number of vendor technical papers.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 72 Where the Customer uses keys generated by the SCD, it is responsible for documenting the key usage, custodianship, access controls and protection mechanisms after the keys have been retrieved. In addition to PCI DSS, there are other PCI SSC programs that have stringent requirements for the use of SCDs that meet specific industry certifications; e.g., PCI PTS HSM v2 and FIPS 140-2 level 3. Examples of current standards that include SCD hardware stipulations include PCI P2PE, PCI PIN, PCI TSP, PCI SPoC, and PCI 3DS Core Security Standard. Furthermore, the requirements for these programs may impose additional physical and logical security requirements related to the protection of approved devices. Entities subject to these requirements should confirm that the Provider has been assessed to all relevant physical security requirements necessary to achieve compliance to applicable standards. Similarly, Providers may wish to proactively understand and implement the relevant security controls for these PCI programs if they intend to service markets that have compliance requirements under their programs (e.g., merchant acquirers, gateways). E.12 Change Detection for Cloud-based Systems To meet the objective of timely detection of unauthorized changes to system and configuration files for instances in the cloud, it is important to include monitoring for changes to provisioning code (i.e., scripts or templates) used for deployment of instances to production, as well as implementing controls around images used for deployment of new instances. Controls around images need to include permitting only authorized hardened images developed in accordance with industry best practices (e.g., NIST-800-19030 or The Docker Security Benchmark31) and company configuration standards to be used for deployment of new instances. Prior versions of approved images, as well as generic images that have not been securely configured and approved by authorized personnel, must not be available for use for deployment of production systems. In cases where an instance is based on a read-only operating system, such as CoreOS, use of traditional file integrity monitoring tools for monitoring system files within the running instance may no longer be applicable. However, such change-detection tools may still be required for monitoring integrity of system files for running instances that are based on operating systems where system and configuration files could be modified. E.13 Security of Software Interfaces and APIs Application programming interfaces (APIs) and other software interfaces and protocols (e.g., SOAP and RESTful) are an integral component of cloud computing, supporting interoperability and rapid delivery of cloud services. APIs can be configured to provide access to a variety of functions, allowing Customers and Providers to interact and manage their interactions within the cloud service. 30 Murugiah Souppaya, John Morello, and Karen Scarfone, Application Container Security Guide, NIST Special Publication 800-190 (Gaithersburg, MD: National Institute of Standards and Technology, September 2017). http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-190/sp800-190-draft.pdf. 31 Docker, Inc., Docker Bench for Security, v1.3.3, (Docker, Inc., 2015), https://github.com/docker/docker-bench- security. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 73 As web services and APIs are by nature publicly accessible, their security is critical to the security of the resources to which they provide access. If not properly developed, managed and secured, these interfaces can be exploited or compromised, resulting in unexpected behavior and potentially unauthorized access. For example, a poorly coded API could result in weak authentication protocols, poor access controls or limited auditing capability. Such weaknesses could lead to the exposure of service functionality or sensitive data. If the APIs are not properly secured, they could also be exploited or altered by an attacker to redirect data flows or alter application behavior. APIs and other public interfaces should be designed to prevent both accidental misuse and malicious attempts to bypass security controls. Resilient authentication and access controls, strong cryptography and real-time monitoring are examples of controls that should be in place to protect these interfaces. When consuming APIs exposed by a Provider, it is important to ensure that all applicable PCI DSS requirements

should have documented processes for responding to legal requests for seizure of records, including data/audit logs belonging to the Provider and its Customers. Customers should understand the ramifications of such laws in the countries where their data exists, as well as the processes in which their Provider will engage. Further to the data sovereignty considerations mentioned above, public Providers often have multiple data storage systems located in multiple data centers, which may often be in multiple countries or regions. Consequently, the Customer may not know the location of its data, or the data may exist in one or more of several locations at any particular time. Additionally, a Customer may have little or no visibility into the controls protecting its stored data. This can make validation of data security and access controls for a specific data set particularly challenging.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 36 6.3.2 Data Storage and Persistence In addition to the known range of intended storage locations, data may also be present in other Provider systems used for maintenance of the cloud infrastructure, such as VM images, backups, monitoring logs and so on. Cardholder data stored in memory could also be written to disk for recovery or high availability purposes (for example, in the case of virtual machine suspension or snapshot). Such stored data may easily be forgotten and so not protected by data security controls. All potential capture points should be identified and managed as necessary to prevent unintended or unsecured storage or transmission of sensitive data. Specialized tools and processes may be needed to locate and manage data stored on archived, off-line or relocated images. Potential hypervisor access to data in memory should also be taken into consideration, to ensure that Customer-defined access controls are not unintentionally bypassed by Provider administrator personnel. Organizations should ensure that their particular data security needs can be met by the cloud service before migrating that data into the cloud environment. Considerations should include how storing data types with different levels of sensitivity in the same virtual environment may affect the protection levels required for each data type. Cardholder data, user credentials and passwords, and cryptographic keys are examples of sensitive data that must be protected according to its individual needs. 6.3.3 Data Usage Data must be accessible only to those with a business need, and handled in accordance with the established information security policy. 6.3.4 Sharing Data Because all environments outside the Customer-controlled environment could potentially be untrusted, cloud services should support the secure transmission of cardholder data throughout the cloud infrastructure, between the Customer and cloud environments, between Customer environments and between the cloud infrastructure and other public networks. It is recommended that sensitive data be encrypted for all transmissions through any cloud environment that is not entirely private or controlled by the Customer. Cloud environments outside the Customer-controlled environment should be treated as open or public networks (see PCI DSS Requirement 4.1). 6.3.5 Decommissioning and Disposal In a distributed cloud environment, verifying that all instances of cardholder data have been securely deleted in accordance with the Customer’s data-retention policy is subject to the same challenges identified above for validating data security and access controls. Disposal of cardholder data must be conducted using secure methods in accordance with PCI DSS requirements, and all locations of cardholder data from within both the Customer and Provider environments need to be included. The disposal method should ensure that data is not recoverable upon completion of the disposal process. In addition to data disposal, resource-decommissioning requirements should be defined to support Customers’ future decisions to migrate to a new Provider, decommission their cloud resources or move out of a cloud environment altogether. The Provider should provide data-disposal mechanisms that Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 37 provide assurance to the Customer that all data has been securely removed and deleted from the cloud environment. Procedures for termination of service should be clearly defined and documented, and considered in the context of being subject to regional regulations. Customers may choose to ensure that all data is encrypted with strong cryptography (see Sections E10, “Data Encryption and Cryptographic Key Management,” and E.11, “Secure Cryptography Devices in the Cloud,” for further information) to reduce the risk to any residual data left behind on Provider systems. However, Customers should be aware that leaving potentially unknown quantities of encrypted data on Provider systems after their agreement has been terminated is likely to be a violation of their data- retention policy. 6.4 Incident Response and Forensic Investigation Incident response, escalation procedures and forensics investigations, to ensure timely and effective handling of all security incidents, are critical to both Customers' and Providers' operations and essential elements as part of overall PCI DSS compliance. However, there are distinct differences and challenges both in handling of forensics data and how the incident response processes will need to adjust for each cloud service category. Customers should work with their Providers to document security incident response, forensics and data breach notification-related roles and responsibilities as part of SLAs and contractual agreements, taking into consideration the need to comply with security

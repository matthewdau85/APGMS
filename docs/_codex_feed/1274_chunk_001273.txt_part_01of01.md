GDP adjustment for 2025–26 GST and PAYG instalments Original Published Date 02/04/2025 - 11:10am Resource Type Statement of formula / rates and thresholds Description From 1 July 2025, the gross domestic product (GDP) adjustment factor will change to 4% and will apply for the 2025–26 income year. This is used to work out quarterly GST and PAYG instalment amounts: Taxpayers with a substituted accounting period (SAP) whose income year commenced on 1 January, 1 February or 1 March 2025 will continue to use the 2024–25 GDP adjustment of 6%. This is because their income year started before the current year’s GDP adjustment of 4%. Taxpayers starting their income year from 1 April 2025 will have a GDP adjustment of 4%.

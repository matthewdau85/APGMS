Process (Revised) INTRODUCTION 1.1 Operation This document sets out the Australian Payments Network’s (the Company) process for approval of Devices, Solutions, and Non-Standard Technologies. This document operates as follows: It replaces the Device Approval Process introduced December 2021. It does not form part of the IAC Code Set and may be varied by the Chief Executive Officer without the need to obtain the approval of the IAF or any other person. By submitting an approval application or a delta approval application, a Device Approval Applicant agrees to comply with the applicable terms of this document as in force on the date the application was lodged and, where relevant, ensure the Vendor (or any other relevant third party) provides any necessary information and cooperation required for the Device Approval Process. 1.2 Interpretation The words defined in IAC Code Set - Interpretation and Definitions have the same meaning in this document unless a contrary intention appears. Where there is an inconsistency between a definition reproduced below and a definition in the IAC Code Set, the IAC Code Set definition will prevail. The following definitions are reproduced from the Code Set: (i) “Accepted Standards” means the standards for payment acceptance, transfer of keys or processing of cryptographic data listed in the Device Approval Process. (ii) “Approval Period” means the period during which an Approved Device can be deployed and used in the IAC as provided in the Device Approval Process. (iii) “Approved Device” means a Device that is approved for use within the IAC in accordance with Part 3 of the IAC Code Set Volume 4 (Device Requirements and Cryptographic Management); (iv) “Approved Standards Entity” means an organisation recognised by the Company which develops, maintains and publishes Accepted Standards and lists Devices which have been validated against an Accepted Standard (v) “AusPayNet-Approved Devices List” means the list of Devices approved by the Company and published on the Company’s website. (vi) “Device” means a Secure Cryptographic Device, Solution or Non-Standard Technology used for payment acceptance, transfer of keys or processing of cryptographic data. (vii) “Device Approval Applicant” means the applicant seeking approval of Non-Standard Technology in accordance with the Device Approval Process. (viii) “Device Approval Process” means the process for approval of Devices published by AusPayNet on its website. (ix) “Letter of Approval” means a letter, issued by the Company, approving the use of a Device within the IAC or any other notification of device approval contemplated in the Device Approval Process. (x) “Non-Standard Technology” means technology for payment acceptance, transfer of keys or processing of cryptographic data that by nature of its design is unable to meet an Accepted Standard. (xi) “Solution” means the product and/or service used for payment acceptance, transfer of keys or processing of cryptographic data that requires multiple components for the overall product and/or service to meet all applicable security requirements. (xii) “Sunset Period” means the period during which an Approved Device that had been purchased during the Approval Period may be deployed and may continue to be used in the IAC after its approval expires as provided in the Device Approval Process. Words that are capitalised but not defined in IAC Code Set - Interpretation and Definitions have the following meaning: (i) Delta Application means an application for updating the approval of an Approved Device (ii) Documentation Pack means the system documentation, scheme reports, other laboratory reports, internal testing results and any other documents requested by the Company under the Structured Risk Assessment Process.

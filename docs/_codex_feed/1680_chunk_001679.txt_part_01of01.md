the AusPayNet-Approved Devices List with the new expiry date; and (ii) send the Device Approval Applicant an updated Letter of Approval including the new Approval Period. PROCESS FOR APPROVAL OF NON-STANDARD TECHNOLOGY 4.1 Operation of this clause 4 A Device Approval Applicant may apply to the Company for approval to use a Device that does not comply with an Approved Standard in clause 2.2 above. The Device Approval Applicant may be an Acquirer, Third Party Provider, Device manufacturer or any other party. 4.2 Application for Approval via the Structured Risk Assessment Process. The Device Approval Applicant must submit to the Company via email (PAG@auspaynet.com.au) an Application for Approval. 4.3 Structured Risk Assessment Process Subject to clause 4.5 below, if the Application for Approval is complete, the Company will undertake the Structured Risk Assessment Process outlined in this clause. The SRA contains the following stages: (a) Identification (i) The Company issues to the Device Approval Applicant an SRA Questionnaire. (ii) Upon receiving the completed SRA Questionnaire, the Company identifies, and then requests from the Device Approval Applicant, a Documentation Pack, listing the information required by the Company to undertake an SRA, together with a Vendor Consent and a Non-Disclosure Agreement. (b) Review Following receipt of the documentation the Company will review the material provided. Questions raised during this review will be discussed with the Applicant or their chosen representative. (c) SRA The Company will undertake a risk analysis and produce an Assessment Report. The risk analysis will consider the following aspects: (i) Gaps between the product/solution and related security standards (ii) Quality of evidence provided and any gaps to expected evidence (iii) General security risks associated with the solution (d) Decision The Company will determine on the basis of the Assessment Report whether the Device should be: (iv) Approved (v) Approved with Conditions (vi) Approved for Pilot (vii) Declined. 4.3.1 Application for Approval and SRA Questionnaire (i) Every Application for Approval via the Structured Risk Assessment submitted in accordance with the Device Approval Process will be reviewed by the Company. (ii) If the Application for Approval is complete, the Company will issue to the Device Approval Applicant an SRA Questionnaire. (iii) The Device Approval Applicant must complete the SRA Questionnaire and forward it to the Company to enable the Application for Approval to proceed. 4.3.2 Document Pack, Vendor Consent and Confidentiality Agreement (i) The Company will review the completed SRA Questionnaire and determine what documentation is required to undertake the SRA including, as appropriate, a letter of approval from other regions, scheme letter of approvals, scheme testing reports, other testing reports or any other document (Documentation Pack). (ii) The Device Approval Applicant must submit: (A) all documents identified in the Documentation Pack; (B) the Vendor’s Consent (in such form as required by the Company from time to time); and (C) a Confidentiality Agreement (in such form as required by the Company from time to time). (iii) These documents must be returned to the Company within four months from the date the Company issues them. (iv) If the documents required are not received by the Company within that time, the Application for Approval will lapse unless the Company has granted an extension or a waiver (in its absolute discretion). (v) Following any lapse in an Application for Approval, the Device Approval Applicant must submit a new Application for Approval under the Device Approval Process if it wishes to recommence the application process. 4.3.3 Review The Company will analyse the SRA Questionnaire and Documentation Pack to determine the: (i) system components; (ii) vulnerabilities; (iii) applied mitigants; (iv) data asset flow; and (v) any other information relevant to the assessment of the Non-Standard Technology. The Company will review the SRA Questionnaire and the Documentation Pack. Questions arising during the review will be discussed with the Applicant via email, face-to-face meetings, video conference or other methods as appropriate. Following the Review, the Company may issue the Device Approval Applicant with a request for additional documentation. The Device Approval Applicant must respond to the Company’s request within two months to enable the Application for Approval to proceed. 4.3.4 SRA The Company or a third party nominated by the Company will perform a risk assessment. The Company will determine the compliance and security risks as part of the structured risk assessment focusing on exposure of sensitive data. 4.3.5 Assessment Report The Company will produce an Assessment Report identifying individual risks and an overall SRA Risk Rating. The Company will determine the SRA Risk Rating based on an assessment of the totality of exposure calculations, considering the types of exposures disclosed and the scalability of risk, and a consideration of the risk rating principles in Table 1 below. Table 1 Risk Rating Principles Risk Ratings Guiding Principles Low 1. Data assets are not exposed to known vulnerabilities. 2. Gaps to relevant standards have minimal security impact 3. Mitigations for system components vulnerabilities are mitigated appropriately. 4. Mitigations are verified by third party testing. Medium 1. Data assets are exposed to some vulnerabilities. 2. Gaps to relevant standards have modest security impact 3. System component vulnerabilities are not adequately mitigated. 4. Data assets are exposed to non-scalable vulnerabilities. 5. System component vulnerabilities are subjected to complex attacks with limited data asset exposure. High 1. System component vulnerabilities are subjected to non-complex attacks. 2. Significant gaps compared to relevant existing standards 3. Data assets are exposed to scalable vulnerabilities. 4. Compromise of

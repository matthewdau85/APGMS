Use of Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed (RACI) documents may provide an effective way for organizations to capture PCI DSS ownership, responsibilities, and activities. RACI documents also provide a level of responsibility, a clear understanding of what is expected, and the responsibilities of others that can be better understood by all concerned parties. Table 3 defines the RACI functions and the number of individuals who can be assigned to each function. Table 4. Overview of RACI functions RACI Functions Definition Number of Individuals to Assign Responsible Performs or delegates the work and held responsible for the quality and timeliness of work. All tasks require at least one responsible individual. Accountable Takes overall responsibility for the assigned task. Ensures the work gets done and responds appropriately when there are delays or issues. There should be only one accountable person assigned to each task or deliverable. Consulted Asked for input before the work is done. Suggestions may influence the work. No limit to the number of individuals who can be assigned. Informed Given updates, but generally cannot change the work. No limit to the number of individuals who can be assigned. As noted at the beginning of this section, it is essential for large organizations to maintain centralized oversight of PCI DSS compliance activities to ensure that the governance structures across different business units are aligned and that the organization retains awareness of its compliance status at all times. Additionally, this process should be periodically repeated to confirm ownership, responsibilities, and roles. Information Supplement • PCI DSS for Large Organizations • February 2020 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard or constitute legal advice. 11 Appendix A includes examples of tasks that can be used for PCI DSS activities, along with an example RACI template for matching the RACI functions for each task. RACI documents are useful in clarifying and defining roles and responsibilities in cross-functional processes and multiple business units. There are several alternative methods and expanded RACI versions for mapping responsibilities. The version that is most applicable depends on the requirements of the organization. By involving business units directly with the development of RACI documents, the business units can gain a greater appreciation of the compliance efforts across the organization. If processes change, the business units can identify and assist with resolving potential issues at an early stage. Increased and widespread awareness about PCI DSS security controls is crucial to ensure that compliance is maintained, and that the likelihood of PCI DSS requirement gaps and data mishandling are mitigated.

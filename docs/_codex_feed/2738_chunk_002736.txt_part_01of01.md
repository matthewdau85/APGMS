Management Program The PCI SSC’s Assessor Quality Management (AQM) team exists to monitor and review assessor work in order to provide reasonable assurance that assessors maintain a baseline standard of quality. 6.1 QSA Audit Process The purpose of the ongoing QSA audit process is to confirm that each QSA Company is maintaining documented quality processes in accordance with this document and the QSA Company’s internal quality assurance program, as well as to gain assurance that assessor work is at a level consistent with the baseline objectives of the PCI DSS and supporting PCI SSC documentation. PCI SSC reserves the right to audit a QSA Company at any time, and further reserves the right to conduct site visits, at the expense of the QSA Company. Once selected for audit by AQM, the QSA Company will be notified, typically via PCI SSC’s secure assessor web portal for the QSA Program (the “Portal”). The notification will specify the Assessment Results and Related Materials the QSA Company is expected to provide over the course of the audit, which may include but is not limited to internal QA manuals, documented processes such as the Workpaper Retention Policy, ROCs redacted in accordance with PCI SSC policy, and workpapers. The AQM team will review the ROCs, supporting documentation and the QSA Company’s internal QA manual to determine whether the organization’s internal QA processes are sufficiently documented in line with the above requirements and that they are being followed. 6.2 QSA Quality Remediation Process QSA Companies that do not meet all applicable quality assurance standards set by PCI SSC may be offered the option to participate in PCI SSC’s QSA Company Quality Remediation program (“Remediation”) with respect to any PCI SSC Program qualification. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, PCI SSC may offer Remediation in connection with any quality assurance audit, any Violation (defined below) or any other PCI SSC Program-related quality concerns, including but not limited to unsatisfactory feedback from QSA Company customers or Participating Payment Brands. When a QSA Company qualifies for Remediation, the QSA Company will be notified in accordance with the QSA Agreement, typically via registered or overnight mail and/or e-mail. Once the QSA Company signs the agreement to participate (“Remediation Agreement”) and pays the fee(s) required in the notification, the applicable listing on the QSA List will be annotated with “In Remediation” and the listing will display the QSA Company’s details in red text. Refer to the Website – PCI SSC Programs Fee Schedule for details of all applicable fees. At the time of notification that the QSA Company qualifies for Remediation, AQM will provide the QSA Company with information on the requirements and procedures of the Remediation process and what it entails. Once AQM has gained sufficient assurance of quality improvement and the requirements of the Remediation Agreement have been fulfilled, Remediation ends, and the QSA Company’s listing on the Website returns to “In Good Standing” in black text. QSA Companies that fail to satisfy Remediation requirements may be revoked, and QSA Companies electing not to participate in Remediation when eligible will be revoked. Note: The Remediation Statement on the Website affirms the Council’s position on Remediation, and any external queries about a QSA Company’s status will be directed to the QSA Company in question.

Page 24 QSA Companies in remediation may continue to perform PCI SSC Assessments for which they are qualified by PCI SSC unless otherwise instructed by PCI SSC in connection with the Remediation process. 6.3 QSA Revocation Process Each event below is an example of a “Violation” (defined in the QSA Agreement), and accordingly, regardless of prior warning or Remediation, may result in revocation of QSA Company and/or Assessor-Employee qualification (and/or other PCI SSC Program qualifications). This list is not exhaustive. Among other things, any qualification under any PCI SSC Program may be revoked if PCI SSC determines that either the QSA Company or any of its Assessor-Employees has breached any provision of the QSA Agreement or otherwise failed to satisfy any applicable QSA Requirement (each also a Violation), including but not limited to. § Failure to meet applicable PCI SSC Program quality standards or comply with applicable QSA Requirements § Failure to pay applicable PCI SSC Program fees § Failure to meet applicable PCI SSC Program training requirements (annual or otherwise) § Failure to meet applicable PCI SSC Program continuing education requirements § Failure to provide quality services, based on customer feedback or evaluation by PCI SSC or its affiliates § Failure to maintain applicable PCI SSC Program insurance requirements § Failure to comply with or validate compliance in accordance with applicable Program Qualification Requirements (defined in the QSA Agreement), PCI SSC Standards or program guides, or the terms of the QSA Agreement or supplements or addenda thereto § Failure to maintain physical, electronic, or procedural safeguards to protect confidential or sensitive information § Failure to report unauthorized access to any system storing confidential or sensitive information § Engaging in unprofessional or unethical business conduct, including without limitation, plagiarism or other improper use of third-party work product in ROCs or other PCI SSC Assessment reports § Failure to comply with any provision or obligation regarding non-disclosure or use of confidential information or materials § Cheating on any exam in connection with PCI SSC Program training; submitting

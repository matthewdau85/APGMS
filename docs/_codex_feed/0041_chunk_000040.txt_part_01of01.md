VIT, participants will conduct a subset of industry testing to enable them to conduct a live Pilot. It is expected that the live Pilot will be a controlled exercise involving a limited use of AES in a production environment. The VIT and Pilot steps are critical in testing and de-risking the subsequent execution program. What are we seeing around the world? There have been some recent notable developments around the world relevant to AES. Firstly, the European Union has begun a coordinated effort for Member States to switch critical infrastructure to quantum-resistant encryption by 2030. This initiative calls for the AES transition to begin by late 2026 and be fully completed by 2035 and aims to safeguard EU data and communications from the threat posed by future, powerful quantum computers. Secondly, the PCI Security Standards Council released its Cryptography Guidance Paper , which outlines the minimum requirement for 128-bit encryption (i.e. AES). This is welcome guidance that is consistent with the approach we are taking with the program. What are we seeing in Australia? The Australian Government released the 2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy (the Strategy) on 21 November 2023. The Strategy outlines the framework for government to take action to uplift Australia’s cyber maturity and preparedness over three phases , with the intention of making Australia a world-leader in cyber security by 2030: Horizon 1 (2023-25) focused on strengthening foundations, with 60 initiatives either delivered or underway. These initiatives are outlined in government’s Action Plan . Horizon 2 (2026-28) will focus on investment in the broader cyber security ecosystem. Horizon 3 (2029-30) will advance the global frontier of cyber security. We will lead the development of emerging critical technologies capable of adapting to new risks and opportunities across the cyber landscape. In moving towards Horizon 2, Home Affairs recently released a Policy Discussion Paper for public consultation. Once feedback is considered, a further industry co-design process will be undertaken on the specific actions and initiatives to take forward in Horizon 2. Looking forward Much is scheduled to happen over the next 18 months. Firstly, before the end of this year we will finalise the key foundational program documents: The Technical Blueprint – this set outs the target state for the migration and references the various standards that apply across the whole system. The Migration Strategy and handbook – these outline our proposed approach to the migration, the principles which we will adopt, how we will manage co-existence, and the framework of dates that will apply for AES sunrise and sunset of TDES. The Industry Test Strategy and Plans – these describe the approach to be taken to testing and certification throughout the program and are complementary to the approaches adopted by each of the card schemes. We expect to see a number of external documents, including: The Government’s next version of its Strategic Plan for Australia’s Payments System . The updated Position Statement on Quantum Computing and EMV Chip Cryptography from EMVCo. The next round of technical standards from PCI, requiring 128-bit encryption. The outcomes of the consultation on Horizon 2 of the cyber security strategy. From an industry perspective, we expect to see specifications published and test environments made available to support VIT and Pilot. We also expect more conversation about the concept of crypto agility. While the term itself is cumbersome, the concept of being agile in upgrading cryptography is important. More broadly, we expect the focus of the program to move from the work being undertaken at AusPayNet to participant mobilisation and implementation programs, with the early participants entering VIT and Pilot. We have a broad communication approach for updates We have a multi-pronged approach to communicate updates, including a webinar program, events, this newsletter and other AusPayNet publications. This is the second The Quantum Leap newsletter, which is produced quarterly and is available on the AusPayNet website. We have a webinar series open to AusPayNet members. The series commenced earlier this year with a webinar introducing the AES Migration Program. Our second webinar will focus on the Technical Blueprint and will be held in November 2025. Additionally, there is ongoing bilateral engagement with Members and we continue to engage with regulators and government.

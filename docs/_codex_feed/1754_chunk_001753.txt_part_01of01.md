Amazon Australia now offers PayTo at checkout, giving customers a seamless way to make a purchase directly from their bank account using a PayID, or BSB and account number. A secure way for customers to pay For Amazon Australia, customer experience is at the forefront, and goes beyond just checkout. From enabling secure payment options, to facilitating choice and enhancing customer loyalty, they work to ensure their experience is aligned with customer needs and expectations, and the PayTo integration was no different. PayTo gives Amazon.com.au customers visibility and control over their payments by facilitating the safe authorisation of PayTo agreements via their online banking. PayTo allows customers to pay straight from their bank account using a PayID (mobile number), or BSB and account number. Plus, a maximum transaction limit for each PayTo transaction is set up within the agreement (up to $1,000), providing more control to customers. Once a PayTo agreement has been authorised, one-click payments are then enabled for one-off and future purchases at amazon.com.au. Amazon is following the lead of our customers, whose preferences are shifting toward banking apps and instant payment methods. This adds a simple, secure and convenient payment solution ensuring our customers have choice and can pay according to their preferences when they check out on Amazon.” Sujit Misra, Director of APAC Payments, Amazon A fast, cost-effective and secure payment option for businesses Amazon is very much indexed on ensuring their customers have the most efficient way to pay, having seen rapid adoption of bank-based payment methods in markets like India, Singapore, and Brazil, and Australia is moving in the same direction. PayTo provides Amazon.com.au customers with a fast, simple and secure way to make one-off and future payments, directly from their bank account, and offers more choice and convenience to the end customer when it comes to checkout options. For Amazon, in addition to giving customers more choice, PayTo also provides certainty to both parties as payments are processed according to the terms a customer has agreed to – including the amount, purpose and frequency of payment. This is all listed in the PayTo agreement which is authorised and managed by the customer in their online banking. The system also creates more streamlined back-end processes, which should help reduce the cost of reconciling payments, while improving visibility of cash flow. NAB’s PayTo solution (Pay by Bank) can be easily integrated into an eCommerce environment, allowing businesses to offer a card-free, seamless payment experience for their customers, whilst saving processing and operational costs for the business.” Joseph Vu, National Director for Technology and Non-bank Financial Institutions, NAB Outcomes Fast and easy checkout Customers now pay directly from their bank account using a PayID, or BSB and account number. Once a PayTo agreement is authorised, one-click payments are then enabled for one-off and future purchases. More visibility and control PayTo agreements are sent to a customer’s online banking for authorisation before any money can come out of their account, helping to reduce the chance of fraudulent payments. Agreements can then be viewed and managed in one secure place. Lower processing costs Real-time payments direct from a customer’s bank account reduces the reliance on card networks and acceptance fees, so businesses can save money. Better experience with instant refunds Real-time refund capability is enabled on amazon.com.au via NAB’s PayTo solution, a key differentiator compared to other payment options which can typically take up to 3-5 business days. Changing the way consumers pay online Amazon launched PayTo with NAB, and together this is leading the shift towards real-time payments, leveraging the NPP. With Amazon already on board, the move toward real-time account-to-account payments is poised to gain momentum, particularly as cash use declines and digital payment methods continues to grow.

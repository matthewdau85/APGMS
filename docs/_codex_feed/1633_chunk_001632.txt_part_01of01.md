AusPayNet has now established (and operationalised) the key program governance structures including forming of the Steering Committe and the supporting two working groups. The membership of the working groups reflects the majority of the paper market share. Overall, the AusPayNet program, working with the APCS member participants, has initiated activities to achieve the following key objectives: Developing and managing industry roadmap and participant exits Developing and managing the transition approach and plan for cheques use cases (incl. bank cheques), and a detailed Migration dashboard Developing, managing and executing on industry-level communication strategy, approach, operating model and execution plans Facilitating a coordinated transition including definition of exit criteria. In the following weeks, the Program will provide further details/update on key topics and will aim to share migration progress once industry dashboards have been established. For any queries or feedback, please reach out to our Head of Transition Programs .

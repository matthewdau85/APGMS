Transaction on line. The failure could be at the Merchant’s device, the Merchant to Acquirer link or the Interchange. (b) There are four specific fall-back modes for ICC originated Transactions namely: (i) Chip Fall-back: occurs where the Transactions rules require online authorisation and the Terminal is unable to go online. Transaction processing proceeds in accordance with the Issuer and Terminal default processing rules (EMV default processing); (ii) Technology Fall-back: occurs when due to a fault of either the ICC or the IFD, the Terminal is unable to retrieve data from the chip. Fall- back is to magnetic-stripe; (iii) Manual Entry: occurs when the Terminal is unable to retrieve Card data from both the ICC and the magnetic-stripe; (iv) Fall-back Override refers to the situation where, when in Chip Fall- back, the ICC returns a decline, and where the Merchant, under certain specified conditions, chooses to override the result. (c) For additional details see Annexure B (Technology Fallback). Figure A.6.4 – Fall-Back Transaction flow (a) A reversal message may be sent when the Terminal fails to receive a 0230 “Financial Transaction Advice” response or when the Terminal fails to authenticate the 0230 response message. Reconciliation Transaction (a) Reconciliation Transactions are used between two end points of a link to confirm the number and value of financial Transactions that have been approved since the last reconciliation process occurred.

STANDARD INTERCHANGE SPECIFICATION Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 41 (b) For Acquiring nodes, the reconciliation totals must not be updated until the financial Transaction response message is received from the Issuing node with an approval action code. (c) Separate reconciliation totals and processing is required for each interface between nodes. (d) A sending node must maintain a set of reconciliation totals for each reconciliation date that the node is currently using in messages being sent. Similarly, the receiving node must maintain reconciliation totals for each date that it is receiving. (e) Each node must support reconciliation dates of the current date, plus the following day. Transactions with reconciliation dates that do not match one of these two dates may be rejected by the receiving system. (f) In the case of bi-lateral links (both acquiring and issuing) separate reconciliation totals must be maintained for messages sent and for those received i.e., they must not be netted. Figure A.6.5 – Reconciliation Transaction flow Declined ICC Transactions (a) For ICC originated Transactions a declined Transaction is any Transaction where the Issuer sends, or where an ICC responds with, a response within the permitted response time, declining the Transaction for reasons which may include but are not limited to, PIN errors, account errors and insufficient funds. (b) Where the Transaction is declined by the ICC (AAC returned), the declined Transaction is not to be forwarded to the Issuer, except where the merchant chooses to override the Card decision in which case the fallback indicator “FBKO\” must be included in the 0220 Advice message sent to this Issuer indicating that the override has occurred.

STANDARD INTERCHANGE SPECIFICATION Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 42 A.7 Network Management (a) Network management involves the initial and ensuing dialog between the applications running at both end of the Interchange Link, which are required to start and maintain the reliable and secure flow of financial messages. It includes messages to establish and restore communications at the application layer (session establishment), the exchange of security keys, verification of link status and session termination by either node. (b) Network Management Transactions include link “Sign On/Off, Key Change Requests as well as link status (echo) requests. (c) A Sign On request must precede any other message type on a link and must be immediately followed with a Key Change Advice. Sign On Request (a) A “Sign On” request is used by a node to request permission from the receiving node to transmit financial messages. A “Sign On” is unidirectional and each endpoint is required to “Sign On” independently. (b) A “Sign On” request performs proof-of-endpoint processing as described in clause A.8.4. Figure A.7.1 – Sign On Request (a) A “Sign On” request must precede any other message type on a link and, if successful, be immediately followed by a Key Change Request. Echo Test (a) Echo Test Transactions are used by both nodes of a link to ensure that the other node is receiving messages and responding at an application's level. They do not indicate that the link is available for use. These Transactions can be sent at any time once session keys have been established, that is subsequent to a successful Key Change Transaction.

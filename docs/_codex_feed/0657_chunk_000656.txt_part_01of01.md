These include requirements regarding: 19 (i) PIN encryption and Message Authentication across IAC Interchange Links;20 (ii) Message encryption across IAC Interchange Lines;21 (iii) PIN encryption and Message Authentication from Terminals and across Acquirer links; and (iv) Key management practices. 2.4.2 Message Authentication (for IAC Interchange Links)22 Message Authentication must apply to all IAC Interchange Links. The Message Authentication Code (MAC) must be calculated using, as a minimum, a DEA 3 (128-bit) key, Triple-DES and an algorithm conforming to AS 2805.4.1. All interchange PIN and MAC cryptographic functions must be performed within an SCM that is an Approved Device.23 16 Deleted effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 17 Deleted effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 18 Deleted effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 19 Amended effective 1/1/19, version 008 r&p 002.18 20 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 21 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 22 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 23 Amended effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE PART 2 – TRANSACTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 8 2.4.3 Message Authentication (for Terminals) Message Authentication must apply to all Terminal to Acquirer Links for all financial and key management messages. The MAC must be calculated using a block cipher listed in ISO 18033-3. Allowable block ciphers include DEA 3 (TDES/TDEA) with a 128 or 192 bit key and AES with 128, 192 and 256-bit keys.24 The MAC algorithm must be:25 (i) listed in ISO/IEC 9797-1; or (ii) part of an authenticated encryption algorithm specified in ISO/IEC 19772 2.4.4 Privacy of Communication (for IAC Interchange Lines) 26 IAC Interchange Lines shall be subject to whole-of-message encryption, excluding communications headers, using at a minimum, Triple-DES and a DEA 3 (128-bit)- bit key in accordance with AS 2805.5.4. 2.4.5 Privacy of Communication (for Terminals) This clause applies to links between an EFTPOS Terminal and an Acquirer. For all Terminal to Acquirer links, Acquirers must ensure that privacy of communication complies with AS 2805.9 or any other privacy of communication standard approved by the Management Committee. All application level data elements, including but not limited to fields P-45 (Track 1 data) and P-35 (Track 2 data), as defined in AS 2805.2, must be protected except those fields necessary to indicate the origin of the transaction and information required to correctly reconstruct the message. The latter may include the data required to derive the privacy key.27 Where AS 2805.6.7 (DUKPT) is used to secure the dialogue between a Terminal and an Acquirer, compliance with AS 2805.9 must be achieved as per Appendix C of AS 2805.6.7. 2.4.6 Key Management Practices – IAC Interchange Links28 Clause 2.4.6 is Confidential 24 Amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 25 Inserted effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 26 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 27 Inserted effective 1/1/15, version 001 r&p 001.15 28 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE PART 2 – TRANSACTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 9 2.4.7 2.4.8 2.4.9 Key Rolling Process for IAC Interchange Key Encrypting Keys (KEKs)29 The procedures to be adopted for the exchange of IAC Interchange KEKs are detailed in the IAC Code Set Volume 4 (Device Requirements and Cryptographic Management). Key Management Practices IAC Interchange Lines30 In accordance with clause 2.4.4 IAC Interchange Lines must be subject to whole- of-message encryption, excluding communications headers, using at a minimum, Triple-DES and a DEA 3 (128-bit)-bit key in accordance with AS 2805.5.4. IAC Interchange Line Cryptographic Management31 The use of transport level data encryption (e.g., IPSec) is permitted subject to the following conditions: (i) data encryption must use Triple DES with either a 112-bit or 168-bit key length, exclusive of parity bits; (ii) the data stream must be fully encrypted with the exception of communication headers; (iii) where IPSec is used, the system must be configured to use Encapsulating Security Payload, and authentication must be HMAC- SHA-1; (iv) either certificates or encrypted pre-shared secrets must be used (plain text shared secrets not acceptable); (v) tunnel termination points must be within the IA Participant’s or their trusted agent’s facilities; 29 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 30 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 31 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE PART 2 – TRANSACTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 10 (vi) the facility must be supported by documented device management procedures with identified roles and responsibilities and subject to internal audit as prescribed by the IA Participant’s security policy; (vii) ownership and control of end-points must reside with the terminating IA Participant; (viii) split tunnelling is not to be used; (ix) the minimum Diffie-Hellman MODP group size is 1536-bits; and (x) Internet Key Exchange, if used, must be configured to only use main mode. Specifically, aggressive mode must NOT be used. Where encrypted shared-secrets are used, key management, including

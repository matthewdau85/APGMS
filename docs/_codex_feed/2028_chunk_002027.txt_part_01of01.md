that is flexible and extensible, and therefore enables the sending of richer and more complete remittance information with a payment. The NPP Basic Infrastructure is operated by SWIFT under a contract with NPPA and includes three key components: • a new domestic SWIFT network that provides fast connectivity and facilitates payment message flows between infrastructure components, including clearing messages between participating ADIs and settlement messages between these institutions and the FSS • decentralised switching via payment gateways that route messages across the network. These payment gateways are located within participating ADIs' data centres and each ADI is directly responsible for the speed and capacity of their infrastructure. ADIs are also responsible for their own fraud monitoring • the addressing service, which enables customers, through their financial institution, to link their transaction account to a simple unique identifier called a PayID, such as an email address, phone number or ABN. This service provides confirmation of the payee's legal account name when a PayID is entered, which reduces the risk of misdirecting a payment compared with using a BSB and account number to address a payment. Fast Settlement Service The FSS is a service of RITS, developed and operated by the Reserve Bank, which supports the settlement of NPP payments between ADIs 24/7. It does this by providing fast, high-volume settlement of individual NPP settlement requests received from the NPP Basic Infrastructure across the ESAs of the ADIs. The payment message format for the FSS is ISO 20022. RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA BULLETIN – SEPTEMBER 2018 5 When a settlement request for a payment is received, the FSS tests the payment against technical criteria and for funds availability in the relevant ESA. If this testing is successful, settlement will occur irrevocably and unconditionally in real time. An advantage of real-time settlement in the FSS is that it eliminates credit risk since payments are settled with finality immediately, allowing ADIs to make funds available to their customers without generating credit risks and removing the need for other controls, such as caps on exposures. Overlay services ‘Overlay services’ are commercial payment services that use the NPP Basic Infrastructure's capabilities to send payment messages quickly, address payments using PayIDs and send detailed information with payments. The overlay services framework allows for competition and innovation in the provision of payment services. Overlay services can range from simple arrangements that involve setting industry standards or more complex payment solutions that implement new message flows or payment types between participants. The framework also allows overlay services to be offered without all participants joining, which means that they can be launched more quickly and that there is the potential for a variety of industry-wide or more specialised payment solutions to be developed. The first overlay service, Osko by BPAY, is a payment option available via participating ADIs' digital banking channels on a 24/7 basis that enables funds and information to be rapidly transferred and made available to recipients. This service can be used by a range of third parties such as corporates and fintechs to send and receive payments and supporting data in real time. The capabilities of this overlay may also be used as a component of new overlays designed for the needs of particular customer segments. RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA BULLETIN – SEPTEMBER 2018 6 Figure 1: NPP and FSS Infrastructure How are NPP payments processed? The NPP allows customers of a participating ADI to make payments from their account to a customer of another participating ADI with immediate funds availability to the payee. From the perspective of the customers, the process is simple and takes only moments. There are a number of confirmation and clearing steps (which involve the payer ADI confirming its customer has the required funds and the payee ADI confirming that the recipient account exists and is able to receive NPP payments) and settlement steps (which involve the transfer of funds between the ADIs) that occur in quick succession to make this happen (Figure 1): 1. A customer (the payer) initiates a payment through a banking channel such as an on-line banking portal or mobile phone banking application. 2. If the payer has chosen to use a PayID to identify the recipient of the funds, the payer's institution will send an enquiry message to the addressing service to find the payee's BSB and account number linked to the PayID. The legal account name associated with the PayID is returned to the payer for confirmation, which will help to reduce the occurrence of misdirected payments and fraud. RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA BULLETIN – SEPTEMBER 2018 7 3. The payer institution then sends a message with all the relevant payment details, subject to any overlay service requirements, to the payee's institution using its payment gateway. The payee's institution clears the payment by checking the payment details and sends a response back to the payer's institution via its payment gateway, confirming it is able to credit the payee. 4. With clearing of the payment complete, the payer institution's payment gateway automatically initiates settlement by sending a settlement request to the FSS, which tests that the payer institution has sufficient credit funds, and then transfers value between the two institutions' ESAs in real time by simultaneously debiting the ESA of the payer institution and crediting the ESA of the payee institution. 5. The FSS then returns a settlement confirmation to both institutions indicating that settlement has occurred. 6. Once

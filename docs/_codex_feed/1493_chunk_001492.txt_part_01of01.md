payroll, super and business registration. Direct connecting Software transmits direct to the ATO via ebms3 / AS4 protocol. ebMS3 The ebMS3 AS4 messaging capability is the protocol Digital Service Providers are required to build into their software to directly connect to the ATO through the Standard Business Reporting (SBR) digital channel. Encryption The process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access. Encryption key management Lifecycle management of encryption keys protecting them from theft, loss, or misuse. The aim is to minimise the risks of compromised keys. Encryption at rest Is designed to prevent an attacker from accessing the unencrypted data by ensuring the data is encrypted when on disk. If an attacker obtains a hard drive with encrypted data but not the encryption keys, the attacker must defeat the encryption to read the data. Encryption in transit Is when the encrypted data is active, moving between devices and networks such as the internet, within a company, or being uploaded in the cloud. ATO has minimum standards for protocols allowable. Entity validation Entity Validation is the OSF requirement, based upon “Know Your Customer” principles and is the mandatory process of identifying and verifying the client's identity. In the case of DSP’s customers, the entity and contact details need to be validated. Essential 8 A recommended baseline of eight (8) essential mitigation strategies from ACSC to protect against all cyber threats. EVTE External Vendor Testing Environment. DSPs build and test services to be able move into production. Exfiltrate Data exfiltration is the theft or unauthorized removal or movement of any data from a device. This typically involves stealing data from devices through various cyberattack methods. Highly leveraged volumes A DSP product or service that stores over 10,000 ‘accessible individual taxpayer or superannuation related information’ records. Records that relate to the same individual are only counted once. Hybrid model An operating model which uses a combination of software types and connections. Inactive Session Timeout Represents the amount of time a user can be inactive before the user's session access times out and implements a screen lock . An access event, like SSO would be required to re-open the session. It is not a session termination, only a screen lock – the session can continue running in the background. Indirect Connecting Software transmits indirectly to the ATO, usually by a Gateway or SSP (Sending Service Provider). Are digital service providers (DSPs), which enable other DSPs to transmit data to the ATO via the ATO SBR ebMS3 messaging standard. ISM (Information Security Manual) The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) produces the Australian Government Information Security Manual (ISM The purpose of the ISM is to outline a cyber security framework that an organisation can apply, using their risk management framework, to protect their systems and data from cyber threats. ISMS (Information Security Management System) Is a set of policies and procedures for systematically managing an organization's sensitive data. The goal of an ISMS is to minimize risk and ensure business continuity by proactively limiting the impact of a security breach. ISM approved cryptographic algorithms Algorithms which have been extensively scrutinised by industry and academic communities in a practical and theoretical setting and have not been found to be susceptible to any feasible attack. IRAP (The Information Security Registered Assessors Program) Is governed and administered by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC). IRAP provides the framework to endorse individuals from the private and public sectors to provide cyber security assessment services to the Australian Government. In-house developed product A product which has been developed for exclusive use by the organisation to manage their own payroll and other affairs; the product cannot be sold to other organisations. ISO ISO/IEC 27001 is the world's best-known standard for information security management systems (ISMS). It defines requirements an ISMS must meet. ISO/IEC 27000/27001/27002/27017 The ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards enables companies and organisations to establish IT security, cybersecurity, and privacy protection. ISO 27000 outlines the security techniques necessary to properly safeguard customer data. ISO 27001 is where those principles meet the real world. Businesses implement the requirements outlined in ISO 27000 standards and verify the effectiveness of their ISMS through an ISO 27001 audit. ISO 27002 gives guidance on implementing an ISO 27001 ISMS. ISO/IEC 27017:2015 gives guidelines for information security controls applicable to the provision and use of cloud services. myID myID is a Digital Identity app that lets you prove who you are when accessing government online services. NSA National Security Agency NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) NIST develops cybersecurity standards, guidelines, best practices, and other resources to meet the needs of U.S. industry, federal agencies, and the broader public. No Shared Logins Different people using the same credential, that is shared. This is not permitted . If it is the same person logging into multiple devices at the same time, it’s concurrent logins and is acceptable. OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Is a non-profit foundation that works to improve the security of software. The OWASP Foundation is the source for developers and technologists to secure the web. Payroll information Payroll information is data used for reporting payroll information to the ATO. Personnel Security A set of measures to manage the risk of an employee exploiting their legitimate access to an organization’s facilities, assets, systems or people for illicit gain, or to cause harm. PII (Personally Identifying Information) Any type of data

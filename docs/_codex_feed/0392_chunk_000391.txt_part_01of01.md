or for groups of Items if required by the User. A financial institution which is not the User FI may be specified in the Trace Record, but only if it has given its prior written consent to the User FI.220 Note: In many cases the Trace Record is also used to satisfy the requirements of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) concerning the inclusion of Tracing Information in electronic funds transfer instructions. Please refer to Part 5 of the Act for details. 5.12 User Identification Numbers221 Each User must have a unique User Identification Number issued to it. A Framework Participant may, from time to time, apply via BECS Connect for a block allocation of User Identification Numbers as configured by BECS Connect. Where a block allocation is made available, the Framework Participant will issue User Identification Numbers from the block allocation to its new Users. Alternatively, a Framework Participant may apply via BECS Connect for the issue of a User Identification Number to each individual User and enter the full User name and other relevant details. In all cases, all newly approved Users and their User Identification Numbers must be entered in BECS Connect by Framework Participants in accordance with clause 5.3. Framework Participants which issue User Identification Numbers from a block allocation must: (a) establish an appropriate process within their institutions for the accurate and systematic assignment of User Identification Numbers; and (b) before issuing a User Identification Number, ensure that the User is not already recorded in BECS Connect as a User. If it is, consider treatment as an extension of usage of the system under the previously issued User Identification Number. 220 Last amended effective 27/7/07, version 035 r&p 005.07 221 Amended effective 16/9/19, version 062 r&p 002.19 BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES PART 5: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS IN RELATION TO USERS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 41 Clauses 5.14 to 5.22 inclusive are Confidential BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES PART 5: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS IN RELATION TO USERS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 42 BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES PART 5: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS IN RELATION TO USERS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 43 BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES PART 5: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS IN RELATION TO USERS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 44 BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES PART 5: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS IN RELATION TO USERS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 45 BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES PART 5: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS IN RELATION TO USERS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 46 BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES PART 5: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS IN RELATION TO USERS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 47 BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES PART 5: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS IN RELATION TO USERS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 48 BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES PART 5: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS IN RELATION TO USERS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 49 BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES PART 5: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS IN RELATION TO USERS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 50 BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES PART 5: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS IN RELATION TO USERS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 51 The next page is Part 6 BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES PART 6: DIRECT CREDIT SYSTEM Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 52 PART 6 DIRECT CREDIT SYSTEM 6.1 Persons Authorised to Approve Credit Users Any User FI may approve a person as a Credit User. 6.2 User FI Approval A User FI must ensure that a prospective Credit User makes application to the User FI by lodging Credit User documentation in accordance with these Procedures and such other documentation as the User FI requires.

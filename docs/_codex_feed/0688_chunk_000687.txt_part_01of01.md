precede any other message type on a link and, if successful, be immediately followed by a Key Change Request. Echo Test (a) Echo Test Transactions are used by both nodes of a link to ensure that the other node is receiving messages and responding at an application's level. They do not indicate that the link is available for use. These Transactions can be sent at any time once session keys have been established, that is subsequent to a successful Key Change Transaction.

Figure A.7.2 – Echo Test Key Change Advice A Key Change Advice is required after each successful Sign On, and subsequently at intervals not exceeding one hour or the transmission of 256 financial Transactions, to establish the session keys to be used for MAC generation/verification and PIN encipherment/decipherment as described in clause A.8.3.

STANDARD INTERCHANGE SPECIFICATION Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 44 Sign Off Advice A Sign Off Advice is used by either node to terminate the transmission of financial messages in both directions. Figure A.7.4 – Sign Off Advice A.8 Key Management This clause A.8 describes the Interchange key management and exchange process using DEA 3 (128-bit) KEKs (Key Enciphering Keys) with proof of end- point capability. Reference can be made to AS 2805.6.3 or AS2805.6.6. AS 2805 Conformance Key Management will conform to AS 2805.6.1. Interchange Key Encrypting Keys (a) Each interchange node will contain an Interchange Send Key Encrypting Key (KEKs) and an Interchange Receive Key Encrypting Key (KEKr). The Interchange Send KEK will be the same key as the Interchange Receive KEK in the partnering node, similarly the Interchange Receive KEK will be the same as the Interchange Send KEK in the partnering node. The manner by which these keys are generated and installed must be agreed between the partners and employ one of the methods identified in IAC Code Set Manual Volume 4 (Device Requirements and Cryptographic Management).58 (b) The Interchange Key Encrypting Keys are used to encipher and decipher the session keys when they are transmitted between the nodes and in the proof of end points process. (c) Interchange Key Encrypting Keys must be Statistically Unique and must be changed, at a minimum, once every two years. 58 Amended effective 1/1/16, version 002 r&p 002.15 Node 1 Node 2 Sign Off Advice Sign Off Advice Response 0820 Network Management Advice with NMIC = 002 0830 Network Management Advice Response with NMIC = 002 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 6 – ATM SYSTEM CODE ANNEXURE A. STANDARD INTERCHANGE SPECIFICATION Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 45 NODE A NODE B Interchange Key Encrypting Key, send (KEKs) = Interchange Key Encrypting Key, receive (KEKr) Interchange Key Encrypting Key receive (KEKr) = Interchange Key Encrypting Key send (KEKs) Table A.8.2 – Interchange Key Encrypting Keys Session Keys (a) Each node keeps four sets of session keys, two send sets and two receive sets. (b) Each set of session keys consists of three keys, MAC Key, PIN Protect Key and optionally a Data Enciphering Key. Each session key is 128-bits long and stored in a secure manner. (c) The send session key sets are generated by the sending node and numbered "1" or "2". The send session key sets are then forwarded to the receiving node to be used as the receive session key sets. (d) The receive session key sets are received in a 0820 Network Management Advice message with bit 070 equal to 101 from the sending node. The set number of either "1" or "2" contained in bit 53 indicates the receive session key set used by the receiving node to verify the MAC, decipher the data and translate or verify the PIN. (e) One set of send session keys is used at a time and all Transactions sent from the sending node will generate the MAC and encipher the PIN, if present, using the MAC Generator Key and PIN Protect Key, respectively, from the same send session key set. The send session key set used is indicated by bit 53 (contains "1" or "2") in each message. (f) Session Keys must be statistically unique and replaced, at a minimum, once every hour or on every 256 Transactions, whichever occurs first. (g) The Data Encipherment Key is unused. The Data Encipherment Key may optionally be included in the Key Change Message (see Network Management Key Change Advice message format (clause A.12.17) and clause A.13.6).59 (h) When enciphered for transmission, each session key type will use a unique variant of

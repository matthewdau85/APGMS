Intended Audience This guidance is intended for merchants who use or are considering use of payments through e-commerce technologies in their cardholder data environment (CDE) as well as third-party service providers that provide e-commerce services, e-commerce products, or hosting/cloud services for e-commerce merchants. This document may also be of value for assessors reviewing e-commerce environments as part of a PCI DSS assessment. The guidance is applicable to merchants of all sizes, budgets, and industries. This document will be most useful to those merchants that have a solid understanding of their current e-commerce solution and environment. For small-to-medium sized merchants who do not know their e-commerce solution or environment, the recommendation is to review the PCI SSC Payment Protection for Small Merchants1 first and then review the guidance in this document. This document is not intended as an endorsement for any specific technologies, products, or services but rather as recognition that these technologies exist and may influence the security of payment card data. 1.3 Terminology The following term is used throughout this document:  Payment Service Provider (PSP): A PSP offers a service that directly facilitates e-commerce transactions online via its relationship with acquiring member banks of payment card brands. This category includes online payment processors, payment “gateway” service providers, virtual terminal services, and certain e-wallet or prepaid services that also process credit card payment for non-account holders at the point of sale. PSP services are discussed in this document. For additional information on terms or definitions, please review the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms. 1 This family of documents includes Guide to Safe Payments, Common Payment Systems, Questions to ask Your Vendors, and Glossary of Payment and Information Security Terms Information Supplement • Best Practices for Securing E-commerce • April 2017 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 8 2 Understanding E-commerce implementations This section discusses different e-commerce implementations along with their potential impact to the merchant, recommendations for secure implementation, advantages and disadvantages of the implementation type, potential applicability of PCI DSS SAQ, other e-commerce implementations, scoping considerations, and additional features a merchant may want to consider. Some common e-commerce implementations include:  Merchant-managed e-commerce implementations: o Proprietary/custom-developed shopping cart/payment application o Commercial shopping cart/payment application implementation fully managed by the merchant  Shared-management e-commerce implementations: o URL redirection to a third-party hosted payment page o An Inline Frame (or “iFrame”) that allows a payment form hosted by a third party to be embedded within the merchant’s web page(s) o Embedded content within the merchant’s page(s) using non-iFrame tags. o Direct Post Method (Form) o JavaScript Form o Merchant gateway with third-party embedded application programming interfaces (APIs)  Wholly outsourced e-commerce implementations These examples represent some of the most common implementations and are not all inclusive of every deployment option that may exist. Each implementation of hardware components, software applications, and hosting/service models will need to be individually evaluated to determine how this guidance may apply. The following sections discuss these common e-commerce implementations in detail and include basic PCI DSS scoping guidance. 2.1 Shared-Management E-commerce – URL Redirects 2.1.1 What is a URL Redirect? In the URL redirection model, the cardholder is redirected from the merchant’s website to a third-party page. The cardholder then enters their account data into a payment page hosted by the third-party payment service provider (PSP). This may also be called a “punch out” since customers and application users are sent to a PSP’s web pages. This is generally noticeable to the customer as the merchant’s website URL—e.g., http://www.merchant.example.com—changes to that of the PSP—e.g., https://www.psp.example.com.

The customer’s browser then requests a payment form from the PSP. 3. The PSP creates the payment form and sends to the customer’s browser. 4. The customer’s browser displays the PSP’s payment form. 5. The customer enters account data and sends to the PSP. 6. The PSP receives the account data and sends it to the payment system for authorization.

As redirects are commonly used by small and medium business organizations with lower-than-average cardholder data volume, it is less likely an attacker would target a merchant with this type of payment method. However, it is still important for merchants using a URL redirect to ensure their websites are secure, as a compromised web server could mean the redirect is changed to a bogus payment site in order to steal cardholder data—e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks wherein the web server collects and sends data to malicious individuals. This e-commerce option provides an easier way for merchants to provide security for cardholder data, as most of the cardholder data security is performed by the PSP.

PSMS CALCULATION 1. Collection of data: Part 8 (Payment System Market Share) (a) Subject to paragraph 4 below, the Company must collect data in relation to the volume and value of each PSMS Member’s annual transaction activity on a national basis, based on groupings of one or more Recognised APSs which have common characteristics (each a “Payment Stream”) as follows: (i) Paper Payment Stream; (ii) Low Value Payment Stream; (iii) Cards Payment Stream; (iv) High Value Payment Stream; and (v) such other Payment Streams determined by the Board. (b) The Board must determine the method of collecting the data. (c) In this Schedule, “Total Payment System” means the total transaction activity on a national basis in all Recognised APSs. 2. Weightings: Part 8 (Payment System Market Share) (a) The volume and value of each PSMS Member’s transactions in each Payment Stream will be weighted, with volume weighted at 65% and value weighted at 35%. (b) Each PSMS Member’s measure of relative significance in a Payment Stream is then aggregated using a weighting that corresponds to each Payment Stream’s relative significance in the Total Payment System as determined by the Board, using the same weightings for volume and value. (c) A PSMS Member’s PSMS is derived from: (i) the PSMS Member’s market share within each Payment Stream; and (ii) the weightings determined in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) above, in the manner set out in paragraph 3 below. Australian Payments Network Limited Constitution Australian Payments Network Limited Page 45 3. Calculation of PSMS: Part 8 (Payment System Market Share) (a) A PSMS Member’s PSMS is calculated by adding together all of the PSMS Member’s weighted Stream Market Shares (“SMS”) according to the following formula: PSMS = (SMS1*SW1) + (SMS2*SW2) + … + (SMSn*SWn) where: “SMSn” means the PSMS Member’s SMS in Payment Stream number “n”, calculated in accordance with paragraph (b) below; “SWn” means the percentage weight of Payment Stream number “n” within the Total Payment System, calculated in accordance with paragraph (c) below. (b) A PSMS Member’s SMS is calculated by adding together the PSMS Member’s weighted percentage of total stream volume and weighted percentage of total stream value according to the following formula: SMS = (Vol%*0.65) + (Val%*0.35) where: “Vol%” means the percentage of the total volume of annual transaction activity in the Payment Stream attributable to the PSMS Member; and “Val%” means the percentage of the total value of annual transaction activity in the Payment Stream attributable to the PSMS Member. (c) The percentage weight of each Payment Stream within the Total Payment System (“SW”) is calculated by adding together the Payment Stream’s weighted percentage of Total Payment System volume and weighted percentage of Total Payment System value according to the following formula: SW = (SVol%*0.65) + (SVal%*0.35) where: “SVol%” means the percentage of annual Total Payment System volume of activity taking place within the Payment Stream; and “SVal%” means the percentage of annual Total Payment System value of activity taking place within the Payment Stream.

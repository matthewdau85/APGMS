PCI Firewall Basics A ﬁrewall is equipment or software that sits between your payment system and the Internet. It acts as a barrier to keep trafﬁc out of your network and systems that you don't want and didn't authorize. Firewalls are conﬁgured (in hardware, software, or both) with speciﬁc criteria to block or prevent unauthorized access to a network. Firewalls are often included in the router "box" provided by your Internet provider. Firewall rules can seem complex, but conﬁguring them properly is vital to security. If you do not understand how to properly conﬁgure your ﬁrewall, it is wise to seek help from a network professional. Change the original password provided by the vendor (the “default password”) to a strong password Restrict both inbound and outbound trafﬁc to your payment systems to only what is necessary Avoid the use of “Any” in ﬁrewall allow rules “Deny all” trafﬁc that you don’t speciﬁcally authorize Permit only “established” connections into your network (for example, via stateful packet inspection or dynamic packet ﬁltering) Turn on intrusion detection and intrusion blocking, if available Turn on notiﬁcations Turn on Network Address Translation (NAT) to hide your internal addresses from the Internet Check for and install ﬁrewall updates (or patches) to address new vulnerabilities, as soon as the patch is available HERE IS THE MINIMUM SUGGESTED CONFIGURATION FOR A FIREWALL: allow any © 2018 PCI Security Standards Council LLC. www.pcisecuritystandards.org/merchants/

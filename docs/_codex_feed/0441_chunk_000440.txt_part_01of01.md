Framework Participants wishing to utilise this service should refer to the RITS Regulations.149 (c) Framework Participants based in a location not experiencing a public holiday on a day on which RITS is closed will be unable to process payments for value that day.

Use of the Repair Routing Code BSB informs the Receiver that the particulars of the payment are incomplete and that manual intervention is required. (b) The Sender may only forward the payment to the intended Receiver using that Receiver’s Repair Routing Code BSB, after it has reasonably decided that it is impracticable to contact the originator of the payment to clarify beneficiary details. (c) Where the Receiver is unable to apply any payment sent to it in accordance with this Clause 4.9, the Receiver must return the payment to the Sender in accordance with Clause 4.15. (d) Any apparent abuse of the Repair Routing Code BSB facility should immediately be brought to the attention of the Framework Participant in question, so that corrective action can be implemented. (e) Continual abuse of the repair facility should be reported to the Management Committee which may take such action as it considers necessary to prevent that abuse continuing so as to protect the efficiency of the HVCS. 4.10 SWIFT PDS Log (a) Framework Participants must maintain a SWIFT PDS Log in which they will record

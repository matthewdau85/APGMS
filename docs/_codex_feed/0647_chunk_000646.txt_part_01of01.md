number with a specific account number, validate the Cardholder using the authentication values and retrieve the Cardholder PIN for that account number; if control numbers and authentication values are used then the PIN distribution system should be designed and operated under strictly enforced conditions such that no individual, other than the Cardholder, is able to associate a control number, PIN or authentication values with any specific card or account number; if control numbers and authentication values are used then PIN delivery to the end-user equipment (e.g., PC or smart-phone) should not be associated with any Cardholder account data or card number; IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 3 PIN USAGE OVER OPEN NETWORKS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 20 internet PIN advice should be protected using a secure channel established between the client application and the PIN distribution system according to the principles set out in ISO/IEC 11770; and the implementation should take into account malware attacks such as man- in-the-browser or man-in-the-middle. 3.5 Recommendations for Customer select PIN change over open networks48 Issuer’s actions49 Issuers should: 50 advise Cardholders against using the PIN as a credential for electronic banking or any other service and provide an alternative input format for electronic banking credentials e.g., forbidding all numeric passwords;51 provide the Cardholder with appropriate guidance for PIN selection and usage; and provide and use cryptographic mechanisms for protecting the PIN from the point of entry and beyond. Customer select PIN change by Internet In addition to the recommendations in clause 3.5.1, Issuers should follow the recommendations set out below where the Cardholder is allowed to change the PIN using the internet:52 Issuers should provide the Cardholder with security advice for the management of the end-user device used for PIN selection. This should include advice about the dangers of malware and of storing account data and/or PINs on the end-user device or any additional copies made of the device's data e.g., backups; the PIN should be cryptographically protected whilst in storage or transmission using strong encryption53. PIN transmission should be in accordance with the recommendations in clause 3.7;54 initiation of PIN selection should require that the Cardholder enter pre- established credentials such as a control number and authentication value; as the security of the PIN selection is based on the premise that the design and implementation of the system is such that no individual, other than the Cardholder, can associate the control number with a specific account or 48 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 49 Inserted effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 50 Inserted effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 51 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 52 Last amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 53 See 3.1(a) 54 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 3 PIN USAGE OVER OPEN NETWORKS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 21 card number it is essential that the control number and authentication value, where used, not disclose the card or account numbers; If control numbers are used then the control number and authentication values should be communicated using an out-of-band mechanism i.e., through the use of two separate networks working simultaneously to authenticate a user; any key used to generate a control number should not be used for any other purpose and should be managed in accordance with AS 2805.6.1; the PIN and authentication values should not be logged and must be deleted immediately after use; internet PIN selection should be protected using a secure channel established between the client application and the CSP PIN management system according to the principles set out in ISO/IEC 11770; the implementation should take into account malware attacks such as man- in-the-browser or man-in-the-middle; Issuers should ensure that the association of Cardholder authentication credentials with a control number does not weaken the principle that the control number cannot be used to determine a specific account or card number; if control numbers are used then Cardholder authentication should not be performed by the Internet server but rather by the back end Issuer host system and only after the control number has been re-associated with a specific account; web servers should be configured to disable client side caching of web pages that display PIN and associated data during the Internet session. If control numbers are used then the control number should be generated and delivered to the Cardholder in such a way (e.g., by using a PIN mailer) that no-one, other than Cardholder, can associate that control number with that Cardholder without detection;55 the control number should be communicated to the Cardholder in such a way that no-one, other than the Cardholder, can access it without detection; the CSP PIN change system should have no way of associating a control number with a specific Cardholder’s name, address, account, card or phone number; the PIN advice function should exchange only strings of numbers (a control number and authentication values) with the Issuer CSP PIN change system i.e., there should be no other Cardholder identifying information, other than the control number, exchanged during the PIN change function; 55 Amended effective 29/4/16, version 003 r&p 001.16 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 3 PIN USAGE OVER OPEN NETWORKS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 22 the PIN management system should re-associate the control number with

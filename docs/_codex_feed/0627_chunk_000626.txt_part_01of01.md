This checklist presents mandatory requirements relating to general procedures and controls associated with the management of PINs and the associated cryptographic practices. The mandatory requirements are based on the requirements of AS 2805 and ISO 9564.71 A.2.1 General Security Controls72 (a) Any clear-text PIN block format combined with a PIN encryption process has the characteristics that, for different accounts, encryption of the same PIN value under a given encryption key does not predictably produce the same encrypted results. (Note the format 0, format 3 and format 4 PIN blocks specified in ISO 9564.1 meet this requirement.)73 Reference ISO 9564.1, clauses 9.3 and 9.4; PCI PIN SR 3-1. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (b) No procedure requires or permits the Cardholder to disclose the PIN (verbally or in writing).74 Reference ISO 9564.1, clause 6.1.3; PCI PIN SR 2-1 Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason A.2.2 Device Management (a) Any SCD capable of encrypting a key and producing a cryptogram of that key is protected against unauthorised use to encrypt known keys or known 70 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 71 Amended effective 21/11/16, version 004 r&p 002.16 72 Last amended effective 1/7/20, version 011 r&p 001.20 73 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 74 Last amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 1 - INTRODUCTION AND MEMBER OBLIGATIONS ANNEXURE A ANNUAL SECURITY AUDITS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 29 key components. This protection takes the form of either or both of the following: Dual controls are required to enable the key encrypting functions; and/or75 Physical protection of the equipment (e.g., locked access, dual locks from the SCD) under dual control.76 Reference ISO 13491-2, clauses E12 and E13; PCI PIN SR 32-1. 77 Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (b) Document procedures exist, and are followed, to determine that an SCD has not been subjected to unauthorised modification or substitution prior to loading cryptographic keys. This assurance takes the form of one or more of the following procedures:78 Physical inspection and/or testing of the equipment immediately prior to key loading; and/or79 Physical protection of the equipment (e.g., locked access, dual locks from the SCD) under dual control.80 Reference ISO 13491-2, clauses A42 and A43; PCI PIN SR 33-1. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (c) Documented procedures exist, and are followed, to ensure that the SCD is physically protected or otherwise controlled to prevent the SCD being stolen, modified in an unauthorised way, and then returned without detection.81 75 Amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 76 Amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 77 Amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 78 Amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 79 Inserted effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 80 Inserted effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 81 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 1 - INTRODUCTION AND MEMBER OBLIGATIONS ANNEXURE A ANNUAL SECURITY AUDITS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 30 Reference ISO 13491-2, clauses A41, A46 and A48; PCI PIN SR 30-1. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (d) Documented procedures exist to ensure that keys are not installed in any SCD where suspicious alteration of an SCD has been detected until the SCD has been inspected and a reasonable degree of assurance has been reached that the SCD has not been subject to any unauthorised physical or logical modifications.82 Reference ISO 13491-2, requirement A48; PCI PIN SR 29.

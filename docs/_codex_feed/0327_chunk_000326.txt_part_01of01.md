encoding. The original image is normally typeset, converted to a photographic image and then transferred to a printing plate. Modern processes are eliminating many of these steps, but the requirements for maintaining quality remain unchanged. Photo-composing/typesetting devices must use the correct E-13B font and horizontal spacing between characters. If negatives are used, only reliable, stable based film and a properly compounded developer should be used. Because the ink will be magnetic, no guide marks are allowed within the clear band in which the MICR characters will appear. A final inspection of opaquing should be completed using a magnifier over the same clear band area to ensure that pinholes do not go undetected. There are no special requirements for the preparation of plates, other than normal maintenance of good quality control of the process. For direct imaging processes, whether using paper, plastic or metal plates, the same requirements for care apply, that is, use of the correct font and character spacing, plus avoidance of sources of extraneous ink in the clear band. Lithography is particularly sensitive to signal level, character dimensions and extraneous ink. As in letterpress, the aim in offset printing is to lay down a magnetic ink film of constant thickness. Over inking can cause image spread, extraneous ink, set off and distortion as well as difficulty in drying. Care must be taken to check the reverse of printed work for set off which is not permitted in the reverse of the 5/8 inch clear band. Conversely, under inking will cause thin characters, voids and low signal levels. The correct balance must also be maintained between the ink and dampening solution as an imbalance can cause emulsification and a lack of water will allow inking of non print areas, both resulting in extraneous ink. In addition, the offset blanket can cause slurring and double images if not sufficiently tightened. 4.1.2 Magnetic Ink Magnetic inks are manufactured to contain iron oxide that is capable of being magnetised by the write heads of reader/sorters. Because the processes lay down differing ink film thicknesses, offset and letterpress magnetic inks contain differing proportions of iron oxide. Because magnetic ink contains from 50% to 60% iron oxide, it behaves in a different manner to normal inks. Its higher viscosity requires constant agitation preferably using an ink fountain agitator. Magnetic inks also take longer to dry than normal inks and extra care has to be taken in early handling of the printed forms to avoid set off. The presence of iron oxide causes abrasive and chemical changes to press parts and thus greater attention is required to maintenance than is normal. As magnetic ink does not run as consistently as normal inks, particularly on offset machines, output must be checked at regular intervals to see that the image is still sharp and smooth, and the signal level is correct. 4.2 Ribbon Encoding Ribbon encoding involves the transfer of a magnetic coating from a plastic film carrier to paper using either mechanical force or heat. A number of obsolete typewriter-style transfer methods may still be in limited use but have not been described in this MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 30 AusPayNet September 2017 publication. Apart from the use of this method by cheque printers, it is commonly used in proof encoding machines for adding the amount field. The use of mechanical force leads to this method being also known as impact printing. 4.2.1 Drum Printers Drum printers are used on their own to print MICR characters, or to supplement other impact or non-impact printing methods to provide totally variable data. The method uses a cylindrical drum, which has raised E-13B characters on its surface, rotating at a fixed speed. A bank of magnetically driven hammers is situated opposite this drum and selectively energised by a microprocessor. Between the drum and the hammer bank are the magnetic ribbon and the paper to be printed. A character is printed by a hammer impacting upon the ribbon and forcing the ribbon and paper against the selected MICR character on the drum, the impact transferring the ribbon material to the paper in the shape of the E-13B character. This method has proved capable of providing very consistent, high quality MICR printing if the equipment is correctly maintained. 4.2.2 Numbering Box Printers The use of numbering boxes instead of a drum is an older and more basic method of ribbon encoding. In this case the raised typeface of the numbering box is normally forced against a ribbon onto paper travelling over an anvil. An alternative method moves the anvil against the numbering box. Various configurations of this equipment exist and their effectiveness is dependent on the amount of force used. Some equipment has limited force for the transfer and this can result in poor quality MICR due to incomplete transfer to the paper or flaking of the MICR characters during normal document handling. 4.2.3 Proof Encoder Printers These are usually small, low speed, units with a single row of raised E-13B characters around a narrow drum. The drum is mounted on a rotating axle whose orientation is moved in response to keyboard strokes from the proof-machine operator. The drum presses a narrow ribbon against the document being processed, thus generating the required MICR characters. Because of the lightweight construction and heavy use, this process is often the cause of poor quality MICR encoding. 4.2.4 Thermal Ribbon Encoding

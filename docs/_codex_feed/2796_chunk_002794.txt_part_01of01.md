replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 3 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 Third-Party Service Providers – This guidance document may also provide useful information for TPSPs in understanding the responsibilities of TPSPs to the entities for which the TPSPs are providing services. In addition, a TPSP may be dependent on the compliance of a nested or chained TPSP to achieve overall compliance of a service. The TPSP should understand how best to engage with its partner(s) to ensure PCI DSS compliance of the services being offered. PCI DSS Requirement 12.92 also requires service providers to acknowledge in writing to the TPSP’s customers its responsibilities for securing the customers’ cardholder data or the customers’ cardholder data environment. Acquirers (also known as “acquiring banks,” “merchant banks,” or “acquiring financial institutions”) – As an entity that initiates and maintains relationships with merchants for the acceptance of payment cards, an acquirer is responsible for ensuring that the merchants in its portfolio are using secure TPSPs. 2 This reference is to PCI DSS v3.1 – April 2015 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 4 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 2 Examples of Third-Party Service Providers Below are examples of types of services and providers with which an entity may work:  Organizations involved in the storage, processing, and/or transmission of cardholder data (CHD). Third- party service providers in this category may include:  Entities providing call center and customer contact services  E-commerce payment providers  Organizations that process payments on behalf of the entity, such as a partner or reseller  Fraud verification services, credit reporting services, collection agencies  Third-party processors  Entities offering processing-gateway services  Third-party debt collectors/collection processes  Organizations involved in securing cardholder data. TPSPs in this category may include:  Companies providing secure destruction of electronic and physical media  Secure storage facilities for electronic and physical media  Companies that transform cardholder data with tokenization or encryption  E-commerce or mobile-application third parties that provide software as a service  Key-management providers such as key-injection services or encryption-support organizations (ESO)  Point-of-sale companies (or integrators/resellers) involved with installation, maintenance, monitoring, or otherwise support of their systems.  Organizations involved in the protection of the cardholder data environment (CDE). TPSPs in this category may include:  Infrastructure service providers  Managed firewall/router providers  Secure data-center hosting providers  Monitoring services for critical security alerts such as intrusion-detection systems (IDS), anti- virus, change-detection, compliance monitoring, audit-log monitoring, etc.  Organizations that may have incidental access to CHD or the CDE. Incidental access is access that may happen as a consequence of the activity or job. TPSPs in this category may include:  Providers of managed IT delivery channels and services  Companies providing software development, such as web applications  Providers of maintenance services—for example, HVAC or cleaning services The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

Initial considerations should include measures to protect cardholder data, financial data, and other sensitive and personal data, and complying with local laws and regulations. Each organization should develop its own policies and procedures, as well as its own criteria for pre-selecting and managing potential TPSPs during the vetting process. All efforts should be placed on exerting the appropriate amount of due diligence and performing a risk assessment of pre-selected TPSPs. Below is an example of a high- level process flow that an entity may include as part of its due diligence when engaging TPSPs. Please note this process is not exhaustive. It is meant as a guideline to assist organizations in creating an appropriate due diligence program to engage TPSPs.

Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 3.1 Determining the Scope of the Services Provided When engaging a TPSP, initially, the entity should consider determining the scope of the TPSP's involvement with regard to storing, processing, or transmission of cardholder data and the resulting effect on the security of the CDE. Because TPSP involvement and services may impact the level of risk assumed by the entity when processing payment transactions, thorough due diligence is critical in determining which TPSP is appropriate and which third-party services may be needed. Defining the level of involvement of a TPSP is crucial to understanding the overall risk assumed by the entity related to PCI DSS compliance. The entity may elect to engage an outside party to assist with the assessment of the scope of services to be provided by the TPSP and the applicability of those services to the entity’s PCI DSS compliance. Questions that may help with this process include:  Given the current payment ecosystem and payment channels, what services (security, access, etc.) would affect or impact the CDE and/or CHD? How are the services structured within the TPSP facilities?  What technology and system components are used by the TPSP for the

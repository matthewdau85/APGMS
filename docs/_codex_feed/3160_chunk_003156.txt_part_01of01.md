required to validate PCI compliance is determined by the payment brand or acquirer (merchant bank). SRED An acronym for “Secure Reading and Exchange of Data.” A set of PCI PTS requirements designed to protect and encrypt card data in payment terminals. A PCI Council-listed Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE) solution must use a PTS-approved and listed payment terminal with SRED enabled and actively performing card data encryption. Stand-Alone Terminal A payment terminal that does not rely on connection to any other device within the merchant environment and performs no other functions. The only requirement for it to operate is a connection to the processor through either an Internet connection or a telephone line. If the terminal requires connection to a computerized electronic cash register or is multi-function (like a mobile device), it is not a stand-alone terminal. Strong Authentication Used to verify the identity of a user or device to ensure the security of the system it protects. The term strong authentication often means with multifactor authentication (MFA).

All Rights Reserved. TERM DEFINITION Tokenization A process by which the primary account number (PAN) is replaced with an alternative value called a token. Tokens can be used in place of the original PAN to perform functions when the card is absent like voids, refunds, or recurring billing. Tokens also provide more security if stolen because they are unusable and thus have no value to a criminal. Unencrypted Data Any data that is readable without the need to decrypt it first. Also called “plaintext” and “clear-text” data. Vendor A business entity that supplies a merchant with a product or service needed for the course of business. Where services are offered, the vendor may be considered a service provider and may require access to physical locations or computer systems within the merchant environment that could affect the security of card data. See also Service Provider. Virtual Payment Terminal * Web-browser-based access to an acquirer, processor or third-party service provider website to authorize payment card transactions. Unlike physical terminals, virtual payment terminals do not read data directly from a payment card. The merchant manually enters payment card data via the securely connected web browser. Because payment card transactions are entered manually, virtual payment terminals are typically used instead of physical terminals in merchant environments with low transaction volumes. Virtual Private Network (VPN) * Software that creates a secure, private channel for exchanging data and conducting phone calls over the Internet. Virus Malware that replicates copies of itself into other software or data files on an “infected” computer. Upon replication, the virus may execute a malicious payload, such as deleting all data on the computer. A virus may lie dormant and execute its payload later, or it may never trigger a malicious action. A virus that replicates itself by resending itself as an e-mail attachment or as part of a network message is called a “worm.” Vulnerability * Flaw or weakness which, if abused, may result in an intentional or unintentional compromise of a system. Vulnerability Scan A software tool that detects and classifies potential weak points (vulnerabilities) on a computer or network. A quarterly external vulnerability scan per PCI DSS Requirement 11.2.2 must be performed by an Approved Scanning Vendor. Other vulnerability scans (such as internal scans and those performed after network changes) can be conducted by qualified staff in an organization’s IT department or by a security service provider (such as an Approved Scanning Vendor). See also Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV). Wi-Fi * Wireless network that connects computers without a physical connection to wires. Wireless Payment Terminal Payment terminal that connects to the Internet using any of various wireless technologies.

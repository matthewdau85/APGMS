connection. Note: Only TLS 1.1 or 1.2 connections are considered strong cryptography and supported secure encryption protocols. Each type of browser provides options that enable you to select specific versions of both SSL and TLS, so by a process of elimination you can quickly establish what is actually supported.  As a merchant, many of my customers, either because of policy or because of in-house systems incompatibility, do not have the latest software. Therefore, this may limit the versions of TLS that are available for them to implement. What can I do to be compliant without losing my customers? The best solution is to (1) develop a TLS mitigation plan to disable all early versions of TLS and migrate to TLS 1.2; (2) until the migration is complete, the merchant must address the vulnerabilities associated with the use of insecure protocols through risk-mitigating compensating controls. The PCI Information Supplement, Migrating from SSL and Early TLS, provides guidance on developing the migration plan and implementing risk-mitigating controls, including control recommendations for small merchant environments. Organizations that are unable to discontinue use of solutions that do not support the latest version of TLS must perform an ASV scan quarterly to verify that compensating controls continue to effectively mitigate known and newly discovered vulnerabilities associated with the insecure protocols. Merchants should contact their acquirer to discuss business requirements, limitations of current solutions, and compensating controls in place or planned to address risk to the merchant environment.

What can I do to remain secure until I can upgrade? Until the migration to TLS 1.1/1.2 is complete, a small business must address the vulnerabilities associated with the use of insecure protocols. The PCI SSC Information Supplement, Migrating from SSL and Early TLS, provides guidance on implementing risk-mitigating controls, including recommendations for small merchant environments. Merchants should also talk to their acquiring bank or payment card brand to determine whether there are any other requirements that must be met.  If I stop taking card payments and only accept payments through alternative methods, do I still need to do anything about SSL/TLS? Engaging with e-commerce SPs to handle all or part of the payment processing will most likely reduce the PCI scope and costs associated with PCI compliance for the merchant; however, it does not relieve the merchant of the ultimate responsibility to meet at PCI DSS requirements including any related to SSL/TLS security: o The mobile wallet pay technologies utilize protocols already in place with most swipe and EMV payment terminals. In fact, these implementations, including transactions utilizing the older magnetic swipe terminals, are more secure than regular card-present transactions. This is because tokenization and biometrics on the user device provide a unique, surrogate value that is a substitute for the payment card information (see Section 2.11.3, “Tokenization”). The payment card information is not available to the merchant or the acquirer, and it cannot be reversed engineered to reveal the CHD. This has the benefit of reducing the scope of the cardholder data environment (CDE). Merchants utilizing payment terminals to enable Apple Pay and Samsung Pay transactions that can be verified as not being susceptible to all known exploits for SSL and early TLS may continue using these protocols as a security control. Merchants should contact their acquirer to ensure terminals are PCI validated.  Can I create my own SSL certificates or must I buy them from a commercial CA to be compliant? When the owner of the web server creates SSL/TLS certificates, they are called “self-signed certificates.” There are two very significant problems created by doing this: o Lack of recognition by browsers: The browsers do not know about self-signed certificates, and users will receive “scary dialogs” that a particular website is not trustworthy. This alone should guide legitimate e-commerce merchants to use commercially available SSL/TLS certificates. o Lack of independent verification: If the only form of authenticating a website is the owner saying, “trust me because I am who I say I am,” then the merchant knows nothing about that site (or its owner). This is what phishers and cyber-thieves want: lack of insight into who operates the web server that is purporting to be legitimate. The SSL certificate demonstrates to your customers that your site is a safe place to conduct e- commerce transactions. In effect, easily verifiable certificates show that your site is to be trustworthy. While self-certification is operationally allowable and technically feasible, a third-party certificate Information Supplement • Best Practices for Securing E-commerce • April 2017 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

Hence self-certification in e-commerce is not recommended.  —Are “SSL Certificates” still OK to use? All the technology, marketing, and instructional literature I see references “SSL Certificates”. What is the difference between an SSL 3.0 certificate and a digital certificate? Most digital certificates are advertised as “SSL Certificates” even if

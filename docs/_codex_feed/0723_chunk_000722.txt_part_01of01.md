ESCALATION PROCEDURE Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 129 ESCALATION PROCEDURE H.1 Objective This Annexure H aims to define the escalation procedure to be used in managing and resolving any production problems affecting the ATM and/or the ATM Interchange Link between any two IA Participants. This will ensure that all problems will be managed in accordance with an agreed production problem The proposed ATM process between the two parties to an Interchange. H.2 Escalation Process Interchange escalation procedures are as defined in the escalation Table H5. The table displays the maximum elapsed resolution time (after report of the problem) for each of the three severity levels and three levels of escalation. It is recommended that this process be applied 7 days a week 24 hours a day. (a) Escalation service levels will be based on severity levels determined and confirmed by the [Title of Responsible Officer] for XXXX, and the [Title of Responsible Officer] for Xxxx, at the time of notification of the problem. H.3 Severity levels are as follows: (a) 1 – (Critical): The product/service is unusable or unavailable. (i) System/online/network component down (ii) Product/service unavailable (iii) No bypass available (iv) Any customer service impact – full, impending or limited (b) 2 – (Medium) The product service is useable, but operations are restricted and a level of exposure exists. (i) Limited/no access by network devices (ii) Product/service degraded or restricted (i.e., 1 of 2 communications links down) (c) 3 – (Low) The product service is useable, but operations are restricted and a level of exposure exists. (i) Day to day issue (ii) Problem Identified (iii) No customer impact IAC CODE SET VOLUME 6 – ATM SYSTEM CODE ANNEXURE H. ESCALATION PROCEDURE Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 130 (iv) Resolution available (d) Although this process applies 24 hours a day / 7 days a week, only Severity 1 and Severity 2 problems would be notified to the interchange partner and vice versa after business hours. Any Severity 3 problems which occur after hours can be notified on the next working day and will be tracked as normal problem record. (e) The response by the first level of escalation to problems notified will be an indication of the steps (or at least the next step) which will be followed in order to develop a solution, and if possible, an indication of the timeframe involved. This response will be given to XXXX and Xxxx as the case maybe: (i) Severity Level 1: raise PMS (problem) record; response within 30 minutes of notification of the problem. (ii) Severity Level 2: raise PMS (problem) record; response within 60 minutes of notification of the problem (iii) Severity Level 3: raise PMS (problem) record; response by 5.30 pm on the next working day. H.4 Escalation of Call (a) If the problem CANNOT be resolved within 30 mins (for Severity 1) or 60 mins (for Severity 2) after first being reported, then it must be escalated to the Second Escalation Level. In all cases [Title of Responsible Officer] from XXXX and [Title of Responsible Officer] for Xxxx will take the role of Problem Situation Manager. (b) Support staff from each Interchange party must continue to resolve the problem while the problem is being escalated. (c) Every problem will be treated on its own merit(s). The contact points in each escalation level will manage information flow from both parties and ensure that sufficient

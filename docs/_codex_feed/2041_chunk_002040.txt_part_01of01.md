ADI is not one of the eligibility requirements. Examples of Identified Institutions may include: • Credit unions and building societies • Non-ADI payment service providers and fintechs ii. Identified Institution PayTo User NPP Participant (Initiating) Identified Institution PAG NPP Participant (Initiating) Identified Institution PAG 14 | PayTo Service Overview v2.0 A Connected Institution connects to the NPP infrastructure directly by installing an NPP ‘payment access gateway’, or PAG, in its own environment. A Connected Institution can send payment initiation requests and is not involved in the clearing and settling of payments. Any organisation who can meet the NPP technical connectivity and security requirements along with other applicable criteria, is legally authorised to operate in Australia, and is financially solvent could apply to become an NPP Connected Institution1. Connected Institutions must also comply with the obligations and rules relating to accessing and using the Mandate Management Service (MMS) and the payment initiation service. A Connected Institution can send payment initiation requests and does not need to be an ADI as it is not involved in the clearing and settlement of NPP payments and does not hold funding accounts. As payment initiation messages are instructions for a payment to be made, they are inherently less risky than a payment clearing message, which entails the actual transfer of value from payer to payee. Payment initiation messages only result in the transfer of value when they are acted upon by the payer customer’s account servicer (either an NPP Participant or Identified Institution) who as ADIs are regulated entities. The upfront costs payable to NPP Australia by prospective Connected Institutions relate to the purchase of NPP componentry and the costs of certification: i. NPP payment gateway: the hardware and software that constitute an NPP payment access gateway are supplied to a Connected Institution by NPP Australia, on a cost recovery basis. ii. Certification and accreditation costs: these are the costs incurred by NPP Australia for certifying and accrediting a prospective Connected Institution (including certification fees levied by an external third party assessor). 1 For more information on the criteria to become a Connected Institution, click here iii. Connected Institution Connected Institution PAG A Connect Institution: • Connects directly to the NPP • Does not need to be an ADI • Is the party authorised to initiate payments from the payer customer’s account • Can offer PayTo services to third parties • Sends payment initiation requests directly to the payer customer’s bank • Charged wholesale transaction costs by NPP Australia 15 | PayTo Service Overview v2.0 iv. Client of a Connected Institution A third party wanting to initiate payments could also be a client of a Connected Institution. Similar to the way a PayTo User connects via an NPP Participant or Identified Institution, clients of Connected Institutions gain access to PayTo services through a proprietary channel or service (such as APIs) provided by their Connected Institution. A proprietary commercial arrangement is required between the client and the Connected Institution. Each access option described above (PayTo User, Identified Institution, Connected Institution and client of a Connected Institution) allows the organisation to perform these functions: • Creating PayTo agreements for authorisation by payer customers • Sending authorised payment initiation requests to the payer customer’s financial institution • Performing certain maintenance functions for PayTo agreements that it is a party to, including amending, pausing, resuming, and cancelling Which access option is most appropriate for an organisation will largely be determined by business objectives, volumes, and commercial considerations in meeting the requirements for direct access. NPP Australia has aligned the certification and accreditation requirements for Connected Institutions with the Consumer Data Right ACCC accreditation model. If a prospective Connected Institution is a CDR-accredited data recipient, they will still be required to fulfil NPP Australia’s eligibility criteria but are likely to have already satisfied much of this criteria. This means the certification and accreditation fee, one of the main upfront costs, will be lower for CDR-accredited data recipients. For certain regulated entities, such as an ADI or Prescribed Payment Facility provider, additional certification and accreditation is not required. Connected Institution Client PAG PayTo and CDR payment initiation PayTo has been designed to support customers being able to instruct third parties to initiate payments in real-time from their bank account as envisaged under the Consumer Data Right (CDR). As referenced in the Future Directions of the Consumer Data Right report2, the delivery of the PayTo service could be one means by which financial institutions can meet any potential obligations to deliver payment initiation under CDR. PayTo supports third party payment initiation in a safe and secure manner requiring only one access point, and a range of either indirect or direct access options, including streamlined options for organisations with CDR accreditation. API capabilities APIs will play an important role in supporting third parties wanting to use the PayTo service. APIs can help create seamless, digital processes, and a better end-to-end customer experience. NPP Australia does not host an NPP API service nor offer NPP APIs for third party use on the platform. Participating financial institutions can choose to make their proprietary NPP APIs available for use by third parties. It is anticipated that a number of these will offer APIs to support their PayTo services. For more information on what API services will be made available, organisations should contact their financial institution. Third parties can access the cloud-based NPP Australia Developer Portal where they can

Assurance document3 expounds on questions and guidelines a merchant may use. Additionally, any consultation on contracts or requirements may raise the following additional questions:  What information disclosure can be given as part of an audit or investigation that is not normally disclosed or is redacted due to security concerns?  What support, feedback, or general inquiry SLAs are defined as part of the service agreement? Does this include support or assistance in case of an audit or PFI investigation?  How are evolving guidelines handled? 3 PCI SSC Information Supplement: Third-Party Security Assurance Information Supplement • Best Practices for Securing E-commerce • April 2017 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 47 6 Case Studies for E-commerce Solutions 6.1 Case Study One: Fully Outsourced Redirect Case Introduction ABC Retailer is a typical brick-and-mortar designer clothing retailer. Over the past five years, ABC has expanded to more than 20 retail outlets, offering designer clothing at discount prices. Recently, ABC expanded into the e-commerce market, offering customers a feature-rich website that allows them to pay for goods online with either click-and-collect or delivery options available. Merchants often want to simplify their security and PCI DSS assessment efforts. For purposes of this case study, simplification is achieved using a redirect to a service provider’s (SP) payment page or by utilizing an embedded payment form within an iFrame on the merchant’s website. Description of Environment ABC has outsourced its e-commerce website to a third-party company called PCIWeb Hosting Co. PCIWeb Hosting Co. is responsible for the installation, management, and maintenance of the web-hosting platform and for all development work for the ABC website. A firewall is deployed between the Internet and the ABC website, which is running on a virtual private server (VPS) within its own isolated virtual network. The web server is deployed with a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack, running Magento as the content management system (CMS) driving the ABC e-commerce site. A URL redirect is utilized to redirect users to ABC’s payment service provider (PSP), XYZ PSP Co., for all cardholder data submissions. Payment Flow The following diagram depicts the customer journey and cardholder data flow for ABC’s URL Redirect e- commerce implementation.

The user browses ABC’s website to build a shopping cart. This website is hosted by PCIWeb Hosting Co., which is a third-party hosting company. 2. The ABC website issues a redirect to the XYZ PSP Co. payment page, which is displayed within the customer’s web browser. 3. The customer enters all CHD into this PSP’s payment page, which is submitted directly to the PSP, who is then responsible for handling the payment functions. No CHD is submitted to the merchant; therefore, the merchant has no cardholder data environment. ABC may be eligible to validate PCI DSS compliance via self-assessment, SAQ A, which is applicable to outsourced e- commerce environments using redirection mechanisms to redirect customers to a PCI DSS compliant payment service provider. For merchants with such implementations that are required to validate PCI DSS compliance via an onsite assessment and a Report on Compliance (ROC), SAQ A can be used as a reference for applicable PCI DSS requirements. SAQ A for PCI DSS version 3.2 includes additional PCI DSS requirements to address ongoing threats to merchant web servers that redirect customers to third parties for payment processing.

The product range offered by ShoesInc includes sports, casual, and dress shoes across a range of child and adult sizes. Customers of ShoesInc often return to its website to make subsequent purchases. In a bid to make this process simpler, ShoesInc allows customers to save their card details; however, the customer still needs to submit the card verification value (CVV2/CVC2/CAV2/CID) each time as part of the payment process. This information is captured and stored at the PSP. Merchants often want to simplify their security and PCI DSS assessment efforts. For purposes of this case study, simplification is achieved using an embedded payment form within an iFrame on the merchant’s website. Description of Environment The hosting and website is fully managed and maintained by ShoesInc staff. A firewall is deployed between the Internet and the ShoesInc website, which is running in a demilitarized zone (DMZ) within ShoesInc’s offices. On the internal network, an ERP system is used to manage stock within the warehouse. The web server is deployed on a Windows 2012 operating system running on Microsoft IIS. The ERP software has a front-end web service component running on the DMZ web server that links to the internal ERP. A payment page iFrame is rendered within the customer browser to accept cardholder data. This payment page iFrame is received from ShoesInc’s Payment Service Provider, XYZ PSP Co. All CHD is submitted

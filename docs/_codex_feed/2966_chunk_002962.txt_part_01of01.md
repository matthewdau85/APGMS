Solution Stack or Technology Stack This is the programming language used to build and deploy applications. Examples are .NET, Python, Ruby, Perl, etc. Operating Systems (OS) In a virtualized environment, the OS runs within each VM. Alternatively, if there is no underlying hypervisor present, the operating system runs directly on the storage hardware. Virtual Machine (VM)9 A virtual container executed on a hypervisor on a host. A set of system isolation technologies that provide various degree of security isolation with the host machine’s OS kernel Containers Virtualization technique that allows execution of multiple isolated user- space instances while sharing the same underlying OS kernel Virtual Network Infrastructure For communications within and between virtual machines Hypervisor When virtualization is used to manage resources, the hypervisor is responsible for allocating resources to each virtual machine. It may also be leveraged for implementing security. 9 Providers will often distinguish between Paravirtual (PV) and Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM) virtualization. The Customer should be familiar with the difference and consider its impact on PCI DSS or process isolation concerns.

It is responsible for carrying communications between systems and possibly the internet. Physical Facility The actual physical building where the cloud systems are located Appendix B illustrates a sample inventory for cloud computing systems as guidance for the ways in which Providers and Customers can document the different layers of the cloud environment.

However, it is important to note that the technology layers and their corresponding lines of responsibility may be different for each Provider, even if they use the same terminology to describe their services, and the individual service offerings may or may not align with the responsibility assignments indicated above.

It is imperative that Customers and Providers clearly document and understand where the boundaries are in their particular relationships, rather than assuming that any particular responsibility model applies to them. Even where a Customer does not have control over a particular layer, it may still have some responsibility for the configurations or settings that the Provider maintains on its behalf. For example, a Customer may need to define firewall rules and review firewall rule-sets for those firewalls applicable to the protection of its environment, even though the Provider actually configures and manages the firewalls. Similarly, Customers may be responsible for approving and reviewing user access permissions to its data resources, while the Provider configures the access according to Customer needs. The allocation of responsibility for managing security controls does not exempt a Customer from the responsibility of ensuring that its cardholder data is properly secured. 3.4 Nested Service Provider Relationships Nested service provider relationships are common in cloud scenarios, as Providers sometimes rely on internal departments or other third-party companies to deliver aspects of their services. For example, some Providers use third-party storage providers as part of their cloud service offering, and some might partner with other Providers for redundancy or fail-over as part of their cloud-delivery strategy. An example of nested service provider relationships is illustrated in Figure 2 below: Figure 2: Example of nested service provider relationships Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 12 ▪ Provider 1 relies on Provider 2 for web content delivery services and Provider 3 for media streaming, as well as Provider 1.5 (internal/private cloud) for PaaS. ▪ Provider 4 provides SaaS service to both Providers 2 and 3. ▪ Provider 5 provides IaaS service to Provider 3. There may be multiple layers or levels of Provider dependency, which can affect the security of the cardholder environment. Identifying all third-party relationships that the Provider has in place is important in order to understand the potential ramifications for a Customer’s environment. The existence of multiple nested relationshipsfor example, where there is a chain of vendors and other Providers required for delivery of a cloud servicewill also add complexity to both the Provider’s and the Customer’s PCI DSS assessment process. Where the Customer has a direct contractual relationship with all nested Providers, the Customer will

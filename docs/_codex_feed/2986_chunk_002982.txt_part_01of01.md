Customer should verify that patches are deployed in a timely manner. Patching of applications is typically managed by the Customer, depending on the service and agreements. Secure coding of applications is the responsibility of whoever develops/controls the applications, which may be either the Customer or the Provider, and may vary for different applications. SaaS: The Customer may control or manage the APIs, or it may share responsibility with the Provider. The Provider typically manages patching and updates of all devices, OS and applications, and is also responsible for secure coding of software; however, the Customer should verify that patches are deployed in a timely manner. Customer and Provider Customer and Provider Customer and Provider Requirement 7: Restrict access to cardholder data by business need to know. IaaS and PaaS: Generally, the Customer is responsible for defining access to its data files. Physical location of the information stores might be unknown to the Customer and may need to be identified. The Provider controls the physical storage areas, and Provider-managed access controls are often cumulative to the Customer-defined controls. The use of controls to prevent unintended access to data (for example, to data captured via snapshots, backups, etc.) should also be considered. SaaS: The Customer defines data access needs for its own personnel; however, access to data is ultimately controlled by the Provider.

IaaS and PaaS: The Customer is responsible for ensuring that all accounts under its control use unique IDs and strong authentication. The Provider is responsible for ensuring that strong authentication is used for the underlying infrastructure. Compared to the IaaS cloud service category, the Provider retains significant administrative access rights In SaaS and PaaS cloud service categories. SaaS: The Provider has ultimate control of accounts at all levels. Depending on the particular service, the Customer may have the ability to create user-level accounts within the application or service, or it may be assigned user accounts that the Provider maintains on its behalf. The Customer is responsible for ensuring that all the accounts it uses have strong passwords. Customer and Provider Customer and Provider Customer and Provider Requirement 9: Restrict physical access to cardholder data. All cloud service categories: Physical access to CHD is generally managed by the Provider for all cloud service categories. The Customer rarely has any physical access to cloud systems; and the Provider might not permit onsite visits or Customer audits. This will depend on the particular Provider as well as on the distribution of data across different locations; Customers may not know which location houses their data. Provider Provider Provider Requirement 10: Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data. IaaS and PaaS: The Provider typically manages monitoring and logging for underlying devices and infrastructure, including hypervisors, while the Customer is responsible for monitoring and logging within its own virtual environments. The ability to associate various log files in order to reconstruct events may require correlation between Customer-controlled logs and those controlled by the Provider. Some monitoring activities may be built into the service agreement for the Provider to manage on behalf of Customers. Details of what data will be captured and what will be made available to the Customer will need to be defined. SaaS: The Customer typically relies on the Provider for all monitoring and logging, but may have limited application-level logging such as user logon/logoff, account management and basic reporting.

IaaS and PaaS: Testing is generally managed by whoever has control of the particular aspect of the environment. However, Providers may prohibit Customer testing, in which case Customers may need to rely on the Provider. If the Provider is performing scans, the Customer needs to verify which instances/VMs are covered. Intrusion detection systems (IDS)/intrusion prevention systems (IPS) may not be provided by the Provider. Generally, the Customer can use file integrity monitoring (FIM) to monitor its own virtual environments (including data, applications and logs), while monitoring of system/device files is managed by the Provider. SaaS: The Customer does not have visibility or permission to perform scans and typically relies on the Provider for all scans, testing and monitoring. Customer and Provider Customer and Provider Provider Requirement 12: Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel. All cloud service categories: While the Provider and Customer may define agreed-upon procedures (for example, in the SLA), each party maintains its own security policies and internal procedures. Defined roles and responsibilities, training and personnel security requirements are the responsibility of each party for its respective personnel. Customers should ensure that the Provider policies and procedures are appropriate for the Customer’s risk and security needs. Incident response in particular requires awareness and coordination

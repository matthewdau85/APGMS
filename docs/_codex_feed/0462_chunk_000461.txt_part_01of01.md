Where this is undertaken during a HVCS Fallback Period or a Participant Fallback Period, it must be done in accordance with the Contingency Instructions. 344 Note: Payments addressed to, or sent by, CLS Bank International, should not be included in the relevant settlement figures, because such payments must not be processed on a deferred settlement basis.345 336 Last amended effective 1/1/18, version 037 r&p 001.17 337 Deleted effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 338 Amended effective 13/11/13, version 034 r&p 001.14 339 Last amended effective 1/1/18, version 037 r&p 001.17 340 Last amended effective 23/04/13, version 014 r&p 001.13 341 Last amended 13/11/13, version 034 r&p 001.14 342 Last amended effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 343 Last amended effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 344 Last amended effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 345 Last amended effective 20/8/04, version 014 r&p 001.04 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES PART 10: TRANSITION ARRANGEMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 71 9.32 Failure To Match Rules346 (a) For Settlement under clause 9.30, the Failure to Match Rules are as follows:347 (i) if the amount that one Framework Participant claims is owed to it by another Framework Participant is larger than the amount admitted by that other Framework Participant, the lesser amount will be accepted as the final settlement figure;348 (ii) in particular, if one Framework Participant does not admit that any amount is owing, or fails to provide settlement figures by the latest time allowed, the final settlement figure in that case will be zero;349 (iii) similarly, if each of two Framework Participants claims that the balance between them is in its favour, or if each of two Framework Participants claims that the balance between them is in favour of the other, the final settlement figure in that instance will be zero.350 9.32.2 ESA Entries351 The Reserve Bank of Australia will apply entries to the Exchange Settlement Accounts of Framework Participants in accordance with the final settlement figures calculated in accordance with this PART 9.352 9.33 Interest Adjustment Where Settlement Delayed (a) Where settlement in respect of any exchange of any payment is (for whatever reason) effected on a day other than the day on which that payment was exchanged for value, an adjustment of interest will be made between the creditor and debtor Framework Participants in respect of that payment calculated at the ESR. 353 (b) The Reserve Bank of Australia will record the net balance owing to or by each Framework Participant for each day on which it despatched settlement figures and calculate the interest on the net balance owing for the number of days elapsed until the day of settlement using the ESR applicable to each of those days during that period.354 (c) The Reserve Bank of Australia will notify each Framework Participant of the net amount due to or by it on account of such interest and include such interest each day in the Fallback Settlement amount of each Framework 346 Amended effective 13/11/13, version 034 r&p 001.14 347 Amended effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 348 Inserted effective 13/11/13, version 034 r&p 001.14 349 Inserted effective 13/11/13, version 034 r&p 001.14 350 Inserted effective 13/11/13, version 034 r&p 001.14 351 Inserted effective 13/11/13, version 034 r&p 001.14 352 Amended effective 18/1/16, version 036 r&p 002.15 353 Last amended effective 23/04/13, version 014 r&p 001.13 354 Inserted effective 13/11/13, version 034 r&p 001.14 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES PART 10: TRANSITION ARRANGEMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 72 Participant.355 9.34 Failure To Settle The provisions of Part 12 of the Regulations apply if any Framework Participant is unable to meet its HVCS payment obligations due to be discharged at any particular Fallback Settlement.356 9.35 Settlement Contact Points The primary and fallback contact details and numbers to be used to contact the Reserve Bank of Australia and the settlement contact points for each Framework Participant are specified in Annexure C.2.

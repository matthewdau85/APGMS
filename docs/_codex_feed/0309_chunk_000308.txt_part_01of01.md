shredding etc, so that the account details or the document cannot be readily re-constructed. Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 50 AusPayNet September 2017 7. General Information 7.1 Window-Faced Envelopes Refer to Australia Post booklet "Letter Post and Electronic Mail within Australia", Section 1.5, Amendment No. 95, 1996, or its subsequent replacement. Paragraphs deleted, effective 02/2001 In order to minimise the potential for third party theft or fraud, the payee’s address should not be printed on the cheque for use in a window-faced envelope, rather it should be printed in the accompanying remittance advice. Australia Post’s requirements for the four State delivery bar-code are not compatible with the design and security requirements for cheques as detailed in this publication. The four State delivery bar-code is therefore not to be printed on cheques and must be printed on the accompanying remittance advice, covering letter or envelope. Preceding two paragraphs added, effective 02/2001 Envelopes must be large enough to enable documents to be inserted without folding vertically but of a size that prevents the documents from "floating". 7.2 Sampling Requirements Printers should ensure that sufficient additional forms are printed to provide for evaluation samples. Financial Institutions require sample forms, taken from every run of MICR encoded documents, for evaluation purposes. The following are minimum requirements, which must be supplied unless sampling instructions from the relative Financial Institution specify otherwise. Samples should be submitted to the relative Financial Institution's evaluation centre as soon as possible after printing. For sampling desktop printers, refer to AusPayNet publication "Non- Impact MICR Printing Standards". Test sheets (full sheet if more than one-to-view) should be taken from the beginning and end of run and for each 6000 sheets for runs in excess of this figure. Continuous document samples must be provided at a minimum ratio of one per 6,000 forms printed according to packaging requirements. Samples (one from each MICR encoded numbering box) should be taken according to the number of numbering boxes used ie.: 6 numbering boxes used - 6 samples every 36,000 forms 4 numbering boxes used - 4 samples every 24,000 forms 2 numbering boxes used - 2 samples every 12,000 forms Printers should consult the relative Financial Institution for guidance on samples required for jobs in excess of 100,000 forms. When documents which are part of a system set have attachments eg. customer butts, or have duplicate copies; one complete, untrimmed set/sheet is required in addition to normal samples. Financial Institutions require that a satisfactory evaluation be completed prior to release of forms by the printer. Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 51 AusPayNet September 2017 7.3 Document Writing/Signing/Payee Protection Machines Forms completed by document writing/payee protection machines, which produce either a shredded or perforated surface, can cause processing problems. Customers should consult their Financial Institution prior to contemplating the use of this equipment. The details must be printed as scan readable. 7.4 Production Errors - Cheques and Deposit Forms Quality Control procedures for cheques and deposit forms are detailed in AusPayNet Publication Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Technical Specifications. Amended, effective 19/05/08 When a Financial Institution detects, or is advised of a printing error the Financial Institution must take the action detailed hereunder: 1. Assess the extent of the problem 2. Arrange the immediate withdrawal of the offending documents 3. Arrange reprint if required. 4. If some offending documents have been issued, advise Australian Payments Network Limited full details of the error. 5. Provide details of the title and address of the officer within the ledger Financial Institution to whom enquiries can be made. On receipt of advice from a Financial Institution that an error has occurred, the Australian Payments Network Limited will verify the accuracy of the matter and if found correct will issue to all Financial Institutions, either direct, or through the appropriate industry representative body, details of the production error, the corrective action taken, and the name of the ledger Financial Institution contact officer. 7.5 Paper for MICR Encoded Documents amended, effective 01/07/2005 Financial Institutions require that paper for cheques, deposit forms and summary slips be of a standard suitable for normal handling and multiple passing through reader/sorter equipment, while maintaining a satisfactory processing rate. It is essential that the type of paper selected should be one that is suitable for the method of printing, MICR encoding and infilling. AusPayNet maintains a Paper Register for MICR Encoded Documents. The register contains a list of paper suppliers/manufacturers who have submitted test results of their cheque and deposit form grade papers that conform to AusPayNet’s specifications, which are detailed in the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Technical Specifications, Section 6 - Paper for MICR encoded documents. Amended, effective 19/05/08 The list is available from AusPayNet’s website: www.auspaynet.com.au. The type of paper selected for cheques, deposit forms or summary slips must meet all of AusPayNet’s specifications detailed in the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Technical Specifications, Section 6 - Paper for MICR encoded documents. The relevant Financial Institutions may request proof of conformance to the specifications if the paper selected is not listed on the register. Amended, effective 19/05/08 Paper suppliers/manufacturers wishing to have their cheque and/or deposit form grade paper included on the register should contact AusPayNet for more information.

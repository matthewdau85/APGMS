Rapidly evolving customer expectations, new technologies (most notably AI, real-time systems, digital money, quantum computing), and regulatory intervention continue to drive change in the global payments industry at an accelerating pace. In addition, the ever-increasing sophistication of economic crime has brought customer trust, security and resilience in payments into sharper focus for the industry. These forces are enhancing convenience and choice for customers by creating a stream of opportunities for industry participants to compete intensely through product, service and brand differentiation. At the same time, they are increasing complexity for all stakeholders, which is driving greater demand for industry coordination to address common interests or challenges like upgrade or wind-down of legacy payment systems, combatting scams and fraud, industry resilience, regulatory reforms, or industry self-governance. These changes are reflected in strategic shifts that are taking place at AusPayNet. Over the last three years, the primary focus of AusPayNet has shifted to facilitation and coordination of industry priorities and transformation programs. Meanwhile, AusPayNet’s role in industry self-governance continues to be important as exemplified in the development of new technical standards. With the Government’s reforms agenda picking up momentum again in 2025, it remains paramount that the industry-led model for mandatory standards is settled in 2026-27. Finally, the demand for AusPayNet insights and thought leadership continues to rise with growing membership from a diverse set of industry participants, particularly non-major ADIs and fintechs.

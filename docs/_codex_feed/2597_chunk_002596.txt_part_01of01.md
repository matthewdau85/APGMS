CPSA acknowledges that PCI SSC may review and modify its Fees at any time and from time to time. Whenever a change in Fees occurs, PCI SSC shall notify CPSA in accordance with the terms of Section A.10.1. Such change(s) will be effective immediately after the date of such notification. However, should CPSA not agree with such change(s), CPSA shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to PCI SSC in accordance with the provisions of Section A.10.1 at any time within 30 days after such notification from PCI SSC.

In respect of withholding tax, CPSA will pay such additional amounts as may be necessary, such that PCI SSC receives the amount it would have received had no withholding been imposed.

highlighted above — had not been sufficiently addressed in the current Bill. While recognising that further detail on some of the obligations under the SPF would be provided in the forthcoming SPF rules and sectoral codes, we asked the Committee to consider further refinements to the overarching legislation to enhance the effectiveness and minimise the potential unintended consequences of the Framework. The Committee released its inquiry report on 3 February, recommending that the Senate pass the Bill. The report included two recommendations from the Coalition of particular interest to the payments industry: that the Government provide a clear roadmap for the inclusion of other regulated sectors, including non-bank PSPs and digital assets businesses; and that, to do so, the Government urgently progress new licensing frameworks for those sectors. The Bill was subsequently passed by the House of Representatives on 6 February, and by the Senate on 13 February. We look forward to working with the Government and the relevant regulators on the designation of key sectors in the scams lifecycle, and the development of the SPF codes for those sectors over the coming year. Pre-Budget Consultation In January, AusPayNet made a submission to Treasury’s 2025-26 Pre-Budget consultation. Our submission highlighted that the Australian payments industry is making strong progress on delivering on the Government’s vision — as set out in the Strategic Plan for Australia's Payments System — of a “ modern, world-class and efficient payments system that is safe, trusted and accessible, and enables greater competition, innovation and productivity across the economy ”. We also welcomed the progress made by the Government over the past two years on several of the key initiatives it had committed to under the Strategic Plan. These included consulting on reforms to the PSRA , a new licensing framework for PSPs, the cross-industry SPF, and plans for winding down the cheques system. Our submission emphasised that finalising these and other reforms under the Strategic Plan will be essential to realising the Government’s vision for the Australian payments system over the long term. This will require continued Government focus and adequate resourcing across the relevant regulators and Government agencies over the coming years. In particular, we encouraged the Government to ensure that sufficient funding in the 2025-26 Budget is allocated to: Strengthening Australia's defences against economic crime, including through the implementation of the SPF and the ongoing work of the National Anti-Scam Centre. Implementing the payments licensing framework and ensuring that the relevant regulators have the resources to effectively carry out their roles under the new framework. Modernising Government payments systems and processes to support the industry's transformation initiatives, including the wind-down of the cheques system. Portability Standard After working together with an industry group for over six months, AusPayNet released the draft Standard for Payment Service Provider Porting of Merchant Payment Related Data (Standard) in November 2024. This Standard aims to assist the industry in meeting the RBA’s tokenisation expectation on portability (4.ii and 4.iii) , issued in May 2024. Wider consultation on the Standard and accompanying Guidelines occurred during December 2024 and January 2025, with approximately 100 stakeholder entities invited to provide feedback. The findings from the consultation are currently being considered for the final draft of the Standard to be presented to the AusPayNet Board for their approval by Q2 2025. AusPayNet is grateful for the strong contribution from and the collaboration of the payments ecosystem in the development of the Standard. The process to develop the Standard has yielded valuable insights and learnings, and demonstrated the value AusPayNet provides as a standards-setting body. AusPayNet looks forward to future engagement with the industry on areas where greater standardisation can assist in achieving better outcomes for industry participants and users. Cross-border payments The Financial Stability Board (FSB) continues work on its G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments: Priorities for the next phase of work and Priority actions for achieving the G20 Targets . The FSB has released its Work Programme for 2025, in which it notes that despite progress on Roadmap action items to date, significant effort is necessary to improve the user experience across all payments market segments. Accordingly, the FSB will reframe its strategy to focus on identifying and addressing challenges to implementation of the Roadmap actions and strengthening engagement with the private sector. It will do so in coordination with the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), other standards-setting bodies and international organisations. The FSB also notes that there has been no tangible progress in improving Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) adoption. Industry taskforces CPMI’s public and private sector engagement continues through the Payments Interoperability and Extension (PIE) Taskforce. It recently posted a webinar on its key deliverables. The PIE Taskforce also issued an invitation to market stakeholders to join it, as part of a renewal of its membership base to further increase geographic representation and include a diversity of business models. With much of the policy development completed, the FSB’s focus has turned to implementation of the policy recommendations, as well as to addressing any other legal, regulatory and supervisory frictions that have been identified as significant impediments to achieving the goals of the G20 Roadmap. The FSB, too, has invited organisations that offer cross-border payment services and relevant industry associations to nominate senior representatives to serve on the FSB’s Taskforce on Legal, Regulatory, and Supervisory matters to deliver on these goals. The CPMI’s other area of focus is its cross-border

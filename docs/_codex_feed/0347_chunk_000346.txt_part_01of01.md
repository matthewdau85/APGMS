be overprinted using specialised magnetic toners, to optimise cheque processing. Use MICR toner that is recommended by the manufacturer for the printing system. MICR Overlays and Test Equipment The quality of the MICR on cheques you print is your responsibility. Your Financial Institution may charge you to process poor quality MICR that cannot be processed by the automated clearing system. You must therefore ensure that standards are maintained to prevent poor quality cheque printing. There are tools and equipment available that can be used as overlays, or for testing the quality of MICR printing, some of which can be purchased from AusPayNet:  MICR codeline layouts can be used to check the positioning of the MICR codeline on cheques and deposit forms; and  The AusPayNet Position and Layout Gauge allows you to check spacing, skews, format and alignment of MICR characters.  Optical Comparator with a 12x magnification loupe with an E13B MICR character measuring reticule. For your own interest, you may wish to purchase special equipment so that you can test on a daily basis that the quality of the MICR encoding is acceptable. You will also be required to submit monthly or quarterly cheque samples to your Financial Institution for testing. Your Financial Institution can also provide you with information on how to obtain the necessary equipment to ensure your cheques maintains the required standards and that the MICR code line is always correctly positioned. Guidelines for Companies Intending to Issue MICR Encoded Cheques P a g e | 5 AusPayNet September 2017 Base Stock Cheque base stock must be printed by a commercial printer with a Print Identifier Number (PID). To guard the cheque against alteration and counterfeiting, the minimum requirements are:  The paper must be sensitised  The background printed in a primary solvent sensitive ink  And at least one other security feature: Refer to Section 6 of AusPayNet Publication Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms for more information. The amount of information already printed on the base stock can vary with each order and you should seek advice from your Financial Institution.  The coloured security background will always be pre-printed.  It is preferable to pre-print the $ sign and as many other personalisation details as appropriate, leaving only the account name, number and MICR codeline to be overprinted.  Base stock cheques should be pre-printed with a sequential number to assist your stock control: these numbers are not the serial number of the cheques. Security and Control Procedures For your own protection, you should implement basic security measures associated with cheques, such as keeping cheque blanks in safes or secure cabinets. The following points need careful consideration:  Ensure blank cheques are kept in a safe or a secure cabinet, particularly overnight.  Do not permit anyone to take blank cheques home at any time.  Ensure that cheques have been removed from the computer printer after use and stored securely.  Ensure that cheque completion is properly supervised at all times.  Never leave cheques, whether signed or unsigned, on a desk unattended.  Avoid holding excess stock and shred any obsolete stock.  Take care to check against the possibility of individual blank cheques being removed from the middle of packages.  Ensure that spoiled cheques are properly accounted for and destroyed.  Undertake regular audits of cheque stock. Any discrepancies should be investigated and your financial institution advised.  Cheques must only be signed by authorised signatories who should have sighted the underlying papers (invoices) etc.  Cheques should never be signed blank.  Inform your bank of any changes to the mandate, particularly when authorised signatories leave the company.  The issue of cheques with pre-printed facsimile signatures should be strictly audited.  When signing machines are used, tight computer access controls and audit procedures should be established under the supervision of senior personnel.  Ensure access to computer programs is controlled by use of passwords and that all activities are recorded on an audit trail. Guidelines for Companies Intending to Issue MICR Encoded Cheques P a g e | 6 AusPayNet September 2017  The payee’s name, amount and date, etc should be printed in the same font. The minimum size recommended is 10 point with the exception of the Amount in Figures, which should be printed in not less than 12 point. Despatch by Post  Ensure that window envelopes do not reveal the contents.  Use envelopes of sufficient quality so that the contents cannot be revealed when held up to light.  Discuss with your financial institution alternative methods of remitting large amounts.  Paper Handling Other considerations associated with MICR encoding relate to maintaining the condition of paper used when laser printing MICR encoded documents, to optimise the efficiency of your printing system. Environmental conditions have a major impact on laser printing operations. Of equal importance is acclimatising (“pre-conditioning”) the paper before printing. The following guidelines can help you avoid problems with paper handling, and poor adhesion of the toner to the paper. These guidelines are based on commonly accepted practices within the printing industry. Adjusting Temperature and Humidity Temperature and humidity control are important factors in printing performance. High humidity can cause paper to develop wavy edges, while low humidity can cause paper to have tight edges. Both of these conditions can cause misfeeds, jams, or wrinkling during printing. The moisture

to be mitigated before the technology can be approved for pilot; (v) the Approval Period of the Pilot; and (vi) the conditions of the Pilot including the liability shift to the Acquirer under clause 4.6.3 below in accordance with the Structured Risk Assessment Process. If the Company declines the Application, the Company will advise the reasons for its decision. 4.5 Repeat applications If an application for approval via SRA of a Device is declined, the Company will only accept a repeat application and undertake the SRA Process again if the Device Approval Applicant can demonstrate a documented change in the security landscape or change in the Device justifying, in the Company’s absolute discretion, reconsideration of one or more of the reasons for the Company’s original decision. 4.6 Pilot Letter of Approval, Conditions for Pilot and Outcomes 4.6.1 Pilot Letter The Pilot Letter of Approval will: (i) identify the security vulnerabilities disclosed in the SRA Assessment Report that are required to be mitigated before the technology could be accepted and published in the AusPayNet-Approved Devices List; and (ii) detail the conditions of the Pilot in accordance with paragraph (b) below. The Pilot Letter of Approval will detail the conditions for the Pilot including: (i) the liability shift to the Acquirer as set out in clause 4.6.3 below; (ii) the restrictions of the Pilot which may include without limitation the General Conditions referenced in Table 2 below, customised as appropriate, by the Company in its absolute discretion; and (iii) the Company’s right to terminate the Pilot at any time during the Pilot by notice in writing to the Device Approval Applicant if, in the Company’s absolute discretion, the Company determines the technology is vulnerable to a significant security threat or other security issue. Table 2 Pilot - General Conditions. General Conditions Restrictions Deployment Restriction 10- xx 000 instances/ deployments Reporting Fraud, Chargebacks, Merchant Category Codes Functionality Contactless only, no PIN In flight Remediation After xx Months xx vulnerabilities must be remediated Term 3 to 12 Months Future Approval After xx months, Vendor must start certification against xx standard Deployment Vendor can only deploy in xx Merchant Category Codes Liability Shift Acquirer accepts liability for any fraud incurred during the pilot 4.6.2 Outcomes (a) Following completion of a Pilot, or in response to a request from the Device Approval Applicant at any stage during a Pilot, if agreed to by the Company in its absolute discretion, the Company will: (i) repeat the SRA to determine if the security vulnerabilities identified in the Pilot Letter of Approval have been mitigated; and (ii) determine whether to: (1) approve the Device; (2) approve for Pilot as an extension of the current Pilot or as a Pilot under different conditions; or (3) decline to approve the Non-Standard Technology in accordance with clause 4.4(d) above. 4.6.3 Principles for Liability Shift during a Pilot It is a principle applicable to any pilot that the Acquirer (being the Device Approval Applicant or the Pilot Sponsor) is responsible for card losses incurred by an Issuer, where: (i) such losses arise from the compromise of PIN and/or card data; (ii) the relevant compromise was caused by the use of a Device in a Pilot; and (iii) the relevant compromise occurred during the term of the Pilot. Any claim must be raised either during the Pilot or during the period ending 2 years after the conclusion of the Pilot. The definition of losses will be limited to chargebacks and chargeback fees associated with fraudulent use of PIN and/or card data, and costs associated with re-issuing Cards. Upon an Acquirer identifying that the PIN and/or card data associated with the cards of two or more Issuers have been compromised at device under Pilot (or group of devices under Pilot), the Acquirer must immediately advise AusPayNet in writing. 4.7 Delta Applications 4.7.1 Application for Approval Where modifications are made to an Approved Device on the AusPayNet-Approved Devices List, a Device Approval Applicant may submit a Delta Application listing the modifications, following the process outlined in Part 4.3 above. The Company will undertake a Structured Risk Assessment of the Delta Application and determine whether the approval for the Approved Device should be updated to include all or some of the modifications listed in the Delta Application. The Company will notify the Device Approval Applicant in writing of its decision. If the Delta Application is approved, the Approval Period of the Approved Device will not change however the Company will: (i) amend the AusPayNet-Approved Devices List noting the modifications; and (ii) issue an updated Letter of Approval noting the modifications. If the Delta Application is declined, the Company will advise the reasons for its decision. 4.7.2 Pilot Delta Approval The Company may grant a pilot approval of the modified Device whilst the Delta Application under cl 4.7.1 is in progress, provided; (i) The Delta Application includes a list of all changes made to the Approved Device; and (ii) the Company considers the Delta Application and determines the risk of adverse impact on the security of the modified Device to be low. Where the Company approves a pilot under cl 4.7.2(a) above, the Company will issue a Pilot Letter of Approval to the Device Approval Applicant, detailed in cl 4.6, provided that the term of the pilot: (i) will not exceed 12 months; (ii) may be terminated by Company at any time during the Pilot by notice in writing to

PCI Security Standards Council Bulletin: PCI DSS v4.0 Reporting Updates 14 December 2022 In response to stakeholder feedback, PCI SSC has updated the PCI DSS v4.0 validation documents to remove the “In Place with Remediation” reporting option. This change applies to the PCI DSS v4.0 Report on Compliance (ROC) templates, Attestations of Compliance (AOCs), and Self-Assessment Questionnaires (SAQs). There are no changes to the Standard. To support organizations as they strive for security as a continuous process, the Council is creating a separate worksheet for assessors to document information about areas needing improvement. This new worksheet, along with additional guidance, such as FAQs and other supporting material to help organizations understand and use this worksheet, will be available in early 2023. For any questions about how this update impacts in-progress or completed PCI DSS v4.0 assessments, please contact your compliance-accepting entity. See FAQ 1142 “How do I contact the Payment Card Brands” for payment brand contact details. In addition to removing “In Place with Remediation,” the document updates include some clarifications and formatting corrections. The updated validation documents are available now and can be found in the Document Library. For additional information on this change, please read the following blog post: Changes to PCI DSS v4.0 Reporting: In Place with Remediation ###

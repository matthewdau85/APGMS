adherence to this PCI DSS requirement. As noted further in PCI DSS Appendix A2 regarding SSL, “all service providers must provide a secure service offering”—this includes acquirers, processors, and gateways as well. If a service provider is not able to verify that a merchant has indeed adhered to this mandate and is not able to supply a remediation plan to support its activities towards meeting this requirement, the merchant should consider selecting a different SP. It is also recommended that merchants ensure their systems are using a secure protocol and, if applicable, the service provider can support that protocol. Encrypted Storage Many merchants who opt to utilize an e-commerce solution may not consider the potential for the e- commerce solution to store CHD in some manner. Even if the merchant has received a fully outsourced e-commerce solution, unless specifically noted as a service option, the merchant should ask the potential SP for specifications regarding the manner in which CHD is handled from acceptance to transmission. Many e-commerce solutions may store CHD and sensitive authentication data (SAD) prior to authorization, and that data must be secured in compliance with applicable PCI DSS requirements. This may become a larger issue if the same data remains on the SP’s servers post-authorization, as it is prohibited to store SAD post-authorization. Questions a merchant may want to ask its service provider include the following:  Does the solution ever receive CHD or is a redirect or payment iFrame used for the payment process?  Is CHD ever stored temporarily in memory or on disk before it is transmitted for processing? If so, what efforts are made to remove the data properly? Is this data encrypted while at rest?  If SAD (for example, CVV2) is collected for authorization, is the data securely removed once the solution gives up trying to authorize the transaction? What is the defined retention period for CHD and what is the process for securely deleting this data?  What cryptographic architecture is used to secure the stored CHD? (After 30 June 2018, SPs are required to document this as noted in PCI DSS Requirement 3.5.1.)

Web forms should disable autocomplete for fields accepting payment details, as this may cause the web browser to store a copy of those details after submission. Merchants may consider the use of “password-type” fields for sensitive information. The fields have the benefit of masking input as it is typed, defending against shoulder-surfing attacks; however, this may also increase the incidence of errors during the payment process as the cardholder makes typing mistakes. Form submission should use “POST” methods rather than “GET” methods, as described in the HTTP specification. In addition to being semantically correct, it is common for browsers, proxies, and web servers to cache or log the contents of GET variables or query strings, which may result in clear-text CHD being stored in numerous locations for a single payment. These systems are generally not designed to store POST variables, as these often contain other sensitive data (such as passwords). Note that in some implementations, the use of POST is infeasible. This is common in the case of payment processors providing support for legacy browsers, as the same-origin policy (SOP) prevents a website hosted on one domain (e.g., the merchant) from using POST to send data to another domain (e.g., the payment processor). Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) was designed to allow domains to communicate with each other in a controlled manner and bypass this restriction, but is not supported by some older browsers. In these cases, merchants and service providers should aim to support POST wherever possible, supporting GET only where strictly necessary, and never by sending the data in a URL query string. Use of older browsers may also create difficulty meeting applicable PCI DSS requirements. 2.11.6 Third-Party Content in Payment Forms Payment forms should be developed to avoid the inclusion of any third-party content, or to restrict any third-party content to only that which has been thoroughly vetted and is trusted. Any third-party content (images, scripts, or other content) included on a payment form is an opportunity for an attacker to silently steal CHD. Third-party content may include analytics, testing packages, content optimization, fraud detection, or any other service. In some cases, service providers providing logos (e.g. “security seals”) deliver these as scripts. Scripts included in a merchant website in this fashion run with the same permission as the merchant’s website, so in this way the merchant is not protected by the SOP. The net result of this is that these scripts can modify any element on the page, including monitoring all keyboard input and copying the contents of the page or payment forms to other servers. Effectively, any script running on a website has complete control over that website. If payment websites include content from third parties, a compromise of the third party will result in an attacker gaining control over the payment website.

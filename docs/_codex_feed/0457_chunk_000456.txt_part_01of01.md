(b) During any period in which any provisions of this PART 9 apply, to the extent of any inconsistency, the Contingency Instructions will prevail over these provisions in Part 9 and over any other provisions of these Procedures. 9.3 Responsibilities (a) Framework Participants have a responsibility to each other, and to the system as a whole, to co-operate in resolving any processing difficulties. (b) To the extent that such co-operation does not adversely affect its own processing environment, a Framework Participant receiving a request for assistance from any other Framework Participant, the Company or the System Administrator may not unreasonably withhold such assistance. 293 Amended effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 294 Inserted effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 295 Inserted effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES PART 10: TRANSITION ARRANGEMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 62 9.4 Nature of Contingency (a) Abnormal processing conditions which may occur, within the overall high value system, and need to be provided for include:296 (i) A Disabling Event occurring at the Framework Participant level. Note that if the Disabling Event is a Participant Outage, the Contingency Instructions may also apply. (ii) A Disabling Event occurring at the central site (RITS or CSI) level. Note if the Disabling Event is a RITS Outage, the Contingency Instructions may also apply. (iii) A Disabling Event occurring at the SWIFT communication service (SWIFT FIN Service or SWIFT FIN-Copy Service) level. Note the Contingency Instructions do not apply to this type of Contingency. (iv) Any other event or circumstance specified by the Management Committee and designated a Contingency for the purpose of this Part 9. 9.5 Framework Participant System Failure Overview297 (a) The appropriate response to a Disabling Event at the Framework Participant level depends very much upon the nature of the problem, the time of day that the problem occurs and the level of redundancy that the Framework Participant concerned has available at its Primary Computer Site. While each Framework Participant has responsibilities regarding timely fallback to back-up arrangements, in accordance with Clauses 7.11 to 7.13(a), usually only that Framework Participant will be in the position to properly evaluate the problem and decide on the appropriate course of action for the particular circumstances applying at the time. (b) The Procedures set out in this PART 9 (and where applicable the Contingency Instructions) are designed to provide a framework within which each Framework Participant can consider its response to a particular Disabling Event, but it is recognised that outside factors, for example nature of the Disabling Event and the time of day that the problem occurs, might affect that Framework Participant’s course of action, and where applicable, ability to comply with any contingency procedures in this PART 9 such as fallback to the Back-up Computer Site. In accordance with Clause 9.6(a), a Framework Participant must immediately notify the System Administrator of any Disabling Event and in doing so must indicate: (i) If the circumstances are such that the Framework Participant is unable to comply with any contingency procedures in this PART 9 or if any applicable provisions of this PART 9 would in the circumstances be inappropriate. 296 Amended effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 297 Amended effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES PART 10: TRANSITION ARRANGEMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 63 (ii) If the Disabling Event has or may cause a Participant Outage,

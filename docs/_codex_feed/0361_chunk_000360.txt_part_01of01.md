the law. A number of banks and financial institutions worldwide, including in Australia, have signed up to the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Banking, which champion sustainability at a holistic level through their commitments to the integration of environmental and social considerations into all aspects of their operations, including for clients and customers and by inference, including people with disability. A number of Australian banks are also signatories to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for business which includes supporting ten goals including the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights, including those of people with disability. Other standards relating to accessibility The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) has been developed through the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) with the goal of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility. WCAG includes useful information to reference relating to keyboard design. Additionally, organisations providing content on web sites, not limited to but including information about the accessibility of their payment and other financial services, should be mindful of the WCAG Guidelines and how they relate to making web and mobile content accessible.

SUPPORTING MATERIAL AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION Related Accessibility Frameworks The Guidelines have been developed through reference to and alignment with existing principles around accessible and inclusive design, as outlined below. ➜ Principles of Universal Design The Guidelines draw on the objectives of the Principles of Universal Design. The Principles were developed by a working group of architects, product designers, engineers and environmental design researchers with the North Carolina State University to aid the inclusive design of products and services to meet a wide range of access needs. They are based on the philosophy that designing for accessibility benefits everyone. Think about the example of a ramp going into a building – it doesn’t just support the wheelchair user with being able to access the premises. It is also used by people pushing prams, those using mobility aids or those pushing shopping trollies. Designing for the inclusion of people with a wide range of needs is good for customers, the community and for business. The 7 Principles of Universal Design include: • Equitable Use • Flexibility in Use • Simple and Intuitive Use • Perceptible Information • Tolerance for Error • Low Physical Effort • Size and Space for Approach and Use ➜ The Australian Banking Association’s Accessibility Principles The Guidelines have a correlative relationship with the ABA’s ‘Every Customer Counts – Accessibility Principles for Banking Services’. Specifically, section 2.4 of the ABA Principles covers ‘Banking terminals, ATMs, EFTPOS and other devices’. It includes best-practice recommendations around the broader design and production, as well as user interface and functionality design to inform the accessible design of banking products.

SUPPORTING MATERIAL AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION Accessiblity In Practice There are a number of additional practices that organisations involved in the procurement and design of touchscreen payment terminals can follow to create enhanced accessibility outcomes for people living with motor and / or vision impairments. They’re based on the input from the disability community consultation sessions, feedback from AusPayNet members and documented global recommendations. ➜ Commitment to accessibility Strategic approach to embedding accessibility in business practices Organisations are encouraged to create Accessibility / Disability and Inclusion Action Plans, outlining their strategic approach around supporting customers, the community and employees with disability. Those doing this well are making new commitments every few years, which are then reported on and refreshed in regular update cycles. The Australian Human Rights Commission holds a register of action plans and development resources. Sponsorship and champions Appointing a senior leader(s) as the ‘Sponsor of Accessibility’ within an organisation is also viewed as a best-practice way to drive the embedding of inclusion practices for people with disability. Coupled with an employee action group or champions, this creates a network of advocates who grow the capability and confidence of teams in designing accessible products and services. Industry advocacy Organisations wanting to increase their confidence and capability in this space may consider becoming a member of a peak body such as the Australian Network on Disability, which supports organisations with advancing the inclusion of people with disability in all aspects of business. ➜ Inclusive project design and implementation Accessibility embedded from the start Building accessibility in as a key project requirement from the outset is viewed as more effective than bolting it on afterwards, as it reduces re-work, financial cost and allows for a multitude of needs to be scoped in from the start. Best-practice requires that the business case for any new touchscreen payment technology requires accessibility to be embedded as a key decisioning point at all project phases from initiation to closure, with a ‘no go’ approach to inaccessible solutions. During design, and prior to implementation, it is strongly recommended that users living with a range of impairments be engaged to trial the touchscreen payment solution and provide feedback.

SUPPORTING MATERIAL AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION Accessibility is a funded priority Specific funding for accessibly design, testing and review has to be factored into the project scope and business case, at an equal priority level as all other critical implementation factors such as security testing. Also, in general, retrofitting accessibility is more expensive than incorporating it into the design from the outset.

both, to detect and block unwanted traffic ▪ Data-loss-prevention tools at the hypervisor level, VM level or both ▪ Controls to prevent out-of-band communications occurring via the underlying infrastructure ▪ Isolation of shared processes and resources from cloud tenant environments ▪ Container-based system isolation based on industry standard, vetted technologies ▪ Segmented data stores for each Customer ▪ Strong, two-factor authentication ▪ Separation of duties and administrative oversight ▪ Continuous logging and monitoring of perimeter traffic, and real-time response Segmentation controls should be tested annually (for merchants) or semiannually (for service Providers) to confirm the effectiveness of isolation between Customers in a multi-tenant cloud environment. The Information Supplement Penetration Testing Guidance provides further guidance on segmentation controls and testing principles.10 4.5 Scoping Considerations Merchants or other organizations looking to store, process or transmit payment card data in a cloud environment should clearly understand the impact that extending their CDE into the cloud will have on their PCI DSS scope. For example, in a private-cloud deployment, an organization could either implement adequate segmentation to isolate in-scope systems from other systems and services, or it could consider its private cloud to be wholly in scope for PCI DSS. In a public cloud, the Customer and Provider will need to work closely together to define and verify scope boundaries, as both parties will have systems and services in scope. Appendix D includes Implementation Considerations for PCI DSS Requirements. 10 Penetration Test Guidance Special Interest Group and PCI Security Standards Council, Penetration Testing Guidance, (PCI SSC, September 2017), https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1.pdf.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 20 Recommendations for minimizing and simplifying PCI DSS scope in a cloud environment include: ▪ Do not store, process or transmit payment card data in the cloud. This is the most effective way to reduce the scope of PCI DSS in a cloud environment. ▪ Usage of PCI-listed P2PE solutions may help to reduce PCI DSS scope. While a PCI-listed P2PE solution does not completely remove the need for PCI DSS validation of the payment acceptance environment, the Customer back-end environments could potentially be considered out of scope. ▪ Use other technologies to reduce exposure and devalue the payment card data, such as tokenization. Customers should be aware of and understand the scope impact of various cloud-based encryption and tokenization solutions11for example, those outsourced to the cloud, products developed in-house or off- the-shelf products. o Third-party cloud-based solutions could potentially limit the Customer's exposure to a clear-text primary account number (PAN), as payment card data can be stored with the Provider, and not by the Customer itself. o In-house hosted solutions, whether custom developed or off-the-shelf encryption or tokenization products, require the entity to protect the stored cardholder data within the solution, and will likely involve cryptography, key management and usage of segmentation techniques. ▪ Implement a dedicated physical infrastructure that is used only for the in-scope cloud environment. The scoping process will be simplified if all in-scope operations are limited to a known, defined set of physical and virtual system components that are managed independently from other components. Once these are defined, the Customer will be reliant on the Provider’s ability to ensure that scope boundaries are maintainedfor example, by ensuring that all segmentation controls are operating effectively and that any new components connected to the in-scope environment are immediately brought into scope and protected accordingly. Although service providers are required to perform testing of segmentation controls semiannually, continuous testing in a cloud environment would present validation of controls. ▪ Minimize reliance on third-party Providers for protecting payment card data. The more security controls for which the Provider is responsible, the greater the scope of the CDE will potentially be, thereby increasing the complexity involved in defining and maintaining CDE boundaries. Ensuring that clear-text account data is never accessible in the cloud may also help to reduce the number of PCI DSS requirements applicable to the cloud environment. For instance, Customer performs all encryption and decryption operations and all key-management functions12 in its own data center and uses a third-party cloud only to store or transmit encrypted data. In this scenario, clear-text data would never exist in the cloud environmentnot even temporarily or in memory. Additionally, the cloud environment would never have access to cryptographic keys or key-management processes. 11 Scoping SIG, Tokenization Taskforce, and PCI Security Standards Council, PCI DSS Tokenization Guidelines, Section 3.2, “Maximizing PCI DSS Scope Reduction” (PCI SSC, August 2011), https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Tokenization_Guidelines_Info_Supplement.pdf. 12 In accordance with PCI DSS Requirements. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 21 It should be noted that the encrypted data is still in scope for PCI DSS (generally for the entity that controls or manages the encrypted data or the cryptographic keys13) to ensure that applicable controls are in place. However, by keeping all encryption/decryption and key-management operations isolated from the cloud, the number of PCI DSS requirements that the Provider is required to maintain may be reduced, as these requirements will instead be applicable to the Customer’s own environment and personnel. The Provider will still be in scope for any PCI DSS requirements it manages on behalf of

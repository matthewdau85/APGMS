a number of risks to the organization that can be mitigated through adequate processes and technologies, but organizations should also be aware of the risk their staff face in being approached and threatened by organized crime. It is recommended that training should include awareness of those risks and understanding how the entity would support those personnel should that situation exist. 3.2 Additional Risks and Guidance in Complex Telephone Environments The key area of risk within complex telephone environments is personnel. This would include customer service representatives, the operators or agents that take account data and customer details over the phone, as well as their supervisors and managers. For example, front-line staff and their supervisors receiving account data through a headset or via a computer screen could use a variety of techniques to acquire and record this data, from simply writing the details into a book or mobile device to utilizing key logging or 5 Michele Moore - Cybersecurity Breaches and Issues Surrounding Online Threat Protection - 2017 -ISBN-13: 978- 1522519416 Information Supplement • Protecting Telephone-Based Payment Card Data • November 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

Audio can be captured in transit and it is a trivial task for an attacker to convert audio into queryable data that can be used for fraud. Where such personnel have access to account data or systems in the CDE, the following measures should be in place. Note that this is not a comprehensive list and that many of the best practices in this document reflect PCI DSS requirements. How these requirements apply will need to be determined for each organization. In addition to the controls described in Section 3.1, the following controls are further examples of measures to limit the exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized parties:  Clearly define roles and assign all system access based on need to know, to ensure that the minimum required number of personnel have access to account data. For example, assign roles so that payment card information can be entered by a sales agent, but other staff such as customer service representatives have access only to the masked PAN.  Screen potential personnel prior to being hired (as per PCI DSS Requirement 12.7) to ensure individuals with questionable or criminal backgrounds do not gain access to account data. Screening policies should account for all types of personnel with access to the CDE or payment card data, including full-time and part-time employees, temporary workers, consultants, and contractors. As a best practice, the screening process should also cover internal transferswhere personnel in lower-risk positions who have not undergone a detailed background check are transferred to positions of greater responsibility or accessto help minimize the risk of attacks from internal sources. Examples of screening checks include previous employment history, criminal-record checks, credit history, and reference checks. The specific types of background checks performed should appropriate for the role.  Implement controls to physically protect all forms of media and prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to account data. Cardholder data is susceptible to unauthorized viewing, copying, or scanning if stored unprotected on removable or portable media, printed out, or left on someone’s desk. Do not allow personnel with access to account data to record or store the data on any form of media that is not authorized or could lead to that data being compromised.  Implement a security-awareness program (PCI DSS Requirement 12.6), delivered at the start of employment and at least annually thereafter, to make sure that all personnel are properly trained and knowledgeable about the business’s security policies and procedures. This includes reviewing security policies and procedures with all in-house and at-home/remote agents at least annually to ensure that security processes and procedures are not forgotten or bypassed. As a best practice, consider requiring personnel to acknowledge the security policy as part of their daily sign-in process.  Particular attention must be given to home workers. Some of the examples of controls may be difficult to implement. Organizations should evaluate the additional risks associated with processing account data in unsecured locations and implement controls accordingly. All staff should be made fully aware of the risks related to remote or home-working and what should be required to maintain the ongoing security of systems, processes, and equipment supporting the processing of telephone-based payment card data. Information Supplement • Protecting Telephone-Based Payment Card Data • November 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 19 4 Process PCI DSS specifically addresses physically securing all media. In the context of securing telephone payments in all telephone environments, processes should be implemented and managed to reduce opportunities for fraud of all personnel exposed to account data. PCI DSS also makes clear that even if encryption technologies are in place, an entity should not store sensitive authentication data after authorization. For all telephone environments, sensitive authentication data (SAD) includes the card security code/value that may be taken during a telephone call. The only entities that can store SAD after authorization or for other purposes are issuers and companies supporting issuing services with a business need to retain the data. These entities are required to protect the data in accordance with PCI DSS Requirement 3.2. If

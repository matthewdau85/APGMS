Verify PayTo agreement and payment terms Third Party Payer customer’s Bank MMS API Overview of payment initiation process: 8 | PayTo Service Overview v2.0 In the event that a payment is not successful at the initial attempt, there is a process and rules in place for third parties to retry initiating a payment from the payer customer’s account. Payment initiation messages can be submitted in a range of formats, including real-time via API, ISO message format and possibly in batch form. The specific options available for integration and submitting payment initiation requests is determined between the third party wanting to use the PayTo service and the organisation providing them with access to the NPP and PayTo. PayTo functions Both payer customers and authorised third parties can perform several functions to ensure PayTo agreements are appropriately managed, kept up to date and are accurate. Maintenance functions include being able to: Amend Once a PayTo agreement is created, amendments can be made to certain information contained in an agreement. Depending on the type of amendment made, further authorisation may be required by the payer customer. Cancel PayTo agreements can be cancelled at any time. Once cancelled, a PayTo agreement cannot be used to initiate any further payments. Cancelling an agreement does not change any contractual arrangement between the payer customer and the third party initiating the payment. Pause PayTo agreements can be paused resulting in any associated payments being paused. A paused agreement can be activated again by the party who paused it. Transfer PayTo agreements can be moved from an account held at one bank to another account at a different bank. Transferring agreements does not change the payment terms. Online transfer functionality will be available from July 2023. In the interim, payer customers can move agreements by contacting their financial institution. 9 | PayTo Service Overview v2.0 PayTo offers rich data capability PayTo agreements offer considerable flexibility with a range of available data fields. Data that is contained in a PayTo agreement includes the name of the payer customer, their bank account or PayID details, details of the payment initiator and the frequency and amount of the payments that the customer has pre-authorised. In addition to these mandatory data fields within a PayTo agreement, optional fields can be populated depending on the needs of the payer customer and the party initiating the payments. Use of these optional fields enable additional data to be included in a PayTo agreement that more accurately describes the terms of the payer customer’s authorisation including, for example, payment type (recurring, one-off or ad hoc), any ultimate creditor’s name, descriptions and creditor’s reference/s. The format of PayTo agreements and the data that can be included in both the payment initiation message and the resulting NPP payment message offers significant benefits in terms of data quality and visibility, compared to the relatively opaque nature of direct debit arrangements established under the BECS Direct Entry system, particularly if the payment is being facilitated via an intermediary. PayTo’s rich data capability supports better matching and easier reconciliation.

In particular, PayTo further builds upon existing fraud controls and fraud prevention processes, simplifying the management of issues

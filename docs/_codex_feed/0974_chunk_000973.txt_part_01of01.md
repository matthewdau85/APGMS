trust architecture on PCI DSS scope and network segmentation; looking at defining PCI DSS scope boundaries in micro segmentation and multi cloud implementations; looking at how to develop and maintain a PCI DSS asset inventory given the ephemeral nature of cloud-hosted microservices and systems; looking at the risks associated with the implementation of modern network architectures, given the complexity of these modern system configurations, because with the ease of use of modern network architecture, certainly brings about additional risks and often additional complexity that we must address. And finally, we wanted to provide guidance on specific PCI DSS requirements for verifying scope and segmentation controls, and I believe we did just that. Alicia Malone: So, what made this particular Special Interest Group stand apart from other Special Interest Groups that the Council has conducted in the past? What would you say were the components that really made this process so special? Kandyce Young: This group was really special because we received extensive contributions from many, many members of this group. Over 81 different companies contributed, and that's many more individuals from those organizations. So extensive contributions. This document really represents unified industry acknowledgement and guidance to support the fundamental shift that we've seen to network architecture, which has been fueled by an increased emphasis on identity and access management, and the evolution to dynamic and distributed modern network architecture environments. And that, yes, they can be secured by PCI DSS without having to compromise innovation. This document contains quite a few scenarios and diagrams to explain common segmentation approaches in detail. For example, how to use a proxy to control, manage, and authorize traffic to and from the cardholder data environment, or the CDE, to support a comprehensive segmentation strategy, which is really with the goal of restricting account data to as few locations as possible by eliminating unnecessary data and consolidating that necessary data. The final thing that makes this SIG stand out is really, though we've included a sample responsibility matrix and a sample inventory in some of our other guidance documents, the ones in this document were developed based on real world experiences with third-party service providers now and takes into account how granular services can be. Back end CDE, front end CDE, under cloud management, all of those things are incorporated. So, it's definitely a valuable tool that organizations can use in their contractual discussions with their service providers now. And some of the organizations involved in this SIG can attest to their benefits because they've used them, and it's been helpful to them and that's why we've incorporated them. Alicia Malone: Wow, there is so much great information in this new information supplement, but I imagine that the process probably wasn't that easy to put it all together. What kind of challenges did you face in working with the SIG and putting this informational supplement together? Kandyce Young: So, this document could have easily been a textbook because as I mentioned, we received considerable content from a lot of members throughout the payments industry. And really we've had extensive discussions about let's say scope, because scoping discussions could last all day. But part of my job as a chair included streamlining the material to what was specifically new and relevant to the payment card industry and securing payment data. So for example, cloud implementations and detail on the types of cloud deployment models or containers and orchestration tools and detailed descriptions on those. Instead of including that detail, we've added references to our other information supplements where this detail can be found, such as the cloud computing information supplement or guidance for containers and container orchestration tools information supplement. Instead, we wanted to focus on new, never before published content in this document, but still making sure that the audience knew where to find this related content. Alicia Malone: I really like that approach, Kandyce. I think that makes a lot of sense. Kandyce, what's the one thing or the most important thing that you would like readers to take away from this document? Kandyce Young: If I could, I'd like to say two things, actually. First is, readers will notice that this document does require a base level understanding of foundational scoping and segmentation rules. So, I recommend that before reading this document, if you're new to PCI DSS, let's say, start with PCI DSS itself, or you can start with the information supplement we have guidance for PCI DSS scoping and segmentation. Our latest document isn't an update to that one. It builds on scoping and segmentation, but through the lens of modern network architecture. The second point is that PCI DSS version 4.x can secure a variety of modern network architectures out in the wild now. So, environments that employ network virtualization technologies such as service meshes, software defined networking, or innovative software deployment models, infrastructures code, zero trust architectures. Regardless of the modern network architecture the organization deploys, certain factors should remain consistent to ensure effective PCI DSS scoping and segmentation practices. These include the consistent application of documented policies, strong identity and access management practices, and a solid understanding of where the data is stored and how it flows. This understanding is fundamental to PCI DSS scoping and segmentation practices and should be a priority in any network architecture decision. With these components, applying PCI DSS controls in any of these modern

G List of helpful and related reference materials published by the PCI SSC. Using these references alongside this document is strongly recommended. H The list of the organizations that contributed to this document. 1.4 Terminology A number of terms used in this document are defined in the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard Glossary, Abbreviations and Acronyms https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/glossary). Telephony-specific terms are available in the document’s glossary (Appendix A). In addition to the telephony-related terms and acronyms detailed in Appendix A, the following PCI DSS terms and acronyms are used throughout this document: Table 2 – Payment card data Account Data Cardholder Data (CHD) includes: Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD) includes:  Primary Account Number (PAN)  Cardholder Name  Expiration Date  Service Code  Full track data (magnetic-stripe data or equivalent on a chip)  Card verification code: CAV2/CVC2/CVV2/CID  PINs/PIN blocks Information Supplement • Protecting Telephone-Based Payment Card Data • November 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

All of these data elements, as well as additional personally identifiable information such as, but not limited to, postal code and shipping address are data elements provided by the cardholder during a telephone transaction. The PIN or full track data are not used in the context of CNP. The working environment in which telephone-based transactions are received provides numerous opportunities for compromising payment card data both externally by criminals gaining access to systems and software and internally via personnel with malicious intent handling the calls. Personnel receiving account data through a telephone handset or via a computer screen could use a variety of techniques to acquire and record this data, from simply writing the details into a book or mobile device to utilizing key-logging or recording equipment. In addition, audio signaling can be captured in transit, and it is trivial for an attacker to convert audio into queryable data. Risk-mitigation technologies such as EMV chip cards have helped to significantly reduce card-present fraud rates. As a result, criminals are increasingly looking to exploit CNP channels such as mail order/telephone order and e-commerce. Telephone-based payments represent an area of opportunity for fraudas this method of payment exposes account data in the clearand must be given full consideration in any security strategy and PCI DSS compliance program. 2.2 People, Process, and Technology This document rests on three pillars: people, process and technology. As we will see in the subsequent chapters, after identifying the type of telephone-based payment one is operating, it is important to recognize the risks associated with people in such an environment, the impact they can have on the overall security of payment card data, and how to prevent or reduce these risks. The processes related to people, whether to manage them or their activities, need to be adapted to the environment and the role performed by each group of staff members. The technology needs to support the processes and the people in preventing or reducing the risks to payment card data. 2.3 PCI DSS Applicability to Telephony Environments PCI DSS applies to all system components included in or connected to the cardholder data environment (CDE). The CDE is comprised of people, processes, and technologies that store, process, or transmit cardholder data or sensitive authentication data.1 Accepting spoken account data over the telephone puts personnel, the technology used, and the infrastructure to which that technology is connected into scope of PCI DSS. 1 Refer to the section “Scope of PCI DSS Requirements” in PCI DSS. Information Supplement • Protecting Telephone-Based Payment Card Data • November 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 5 Telephone environments can vary enormously in size and complexity from a small merchant in a simple telephone environment or reception desk where payments are taken over a single telephone line, to a large, complex, multi-site environment or call center operation able to process hundreds of card payment transactions simultaneously. The following sections describe the applicability of PCI DSS requirements to both simple and complex telephony environments. 2.3.1 Simple Telephone Environments For the purposes of this document, a simple telephone environment is an environment where an entity (e.g., a merchant) receives account data via a single or limited number of telephone lines. Payment processing in simple telephone environments often occurs using payment channels such as a dial-up payment terminal or a virtual terminal. Entities processing telephone payments in this way should consider how customer account data is secured. Scenario 1 – Traditional telephone line Generally speaking, entities are not considered responsible for the transmission of card data over an external traditional telephone line (also described as “plain old telephone service,” or POTS), as the risk of man-in-the middle attacks on data transmissions over these lines is considered low. Diagram 1 below shows a simple telephone environment where account data is spoken over a traditional POTS telephone line.

regulated ADI is deemed necessary to ensure prudential safeguards for the platform, in line with well-established international standards for payments systems (as set out by the Bank for International Settlements 3 ). The ADI licensing regime managed by APRA covers extensive and ongoing prudential obligations, including standards for: capital adequacy; securitisation; risk management including liquidity, credit quality, large exposures and business continuity management; prudential reporting and disclosure of prudential information; governance including ‘fit and proper’ criteria for responsible persons operating that particular institution. In particular, an ADI is required to meet standards with respect to operational risk management, including Information Security risk, and is required to hold capital against operational losses. APRA regulated institutions are subject to a rigorous program of ongoing inspection, surveillance, and enforcement activities. An organisation that is not an ADI, and that is not prudentially supervised by APRA, does not provide the same level of counterparty assurance and comfort to NPPA and the NPP Participants that it has the technical, operational or legal capability to perform the required NPP functions or manage data security or fraud risks and to meet associated liabilities. A conditional or restricted ADI may not be fully licensed by APRA as compliant to all of these requirements but will be required to meet certain minimum prudential and operational standards. If at any point in the future, the APRA licensing regime changes, say for example with the introduction of a new class of regulated non-bank entities called “Payment Service Providers” (as suggested by the Productivity Commission report), then at that time, NPPA would consider including these within the NPP access framework, just as we have done recently for organisations with Restricted ADI licences. Identified Institution An Identified Institution can offer their customers real-time data-rich payments via a directly connected NPP Participant who can clear and settle those payments on their behalf (using that institution’s own BSB and SWIFT BIC code but the NPP Participant’s ESA for settlement). A commercial arrangement is required between the NPP Participant acting as the sponsoring direct connector and the organisation seeking indirect access as an Identified Institution. An Identified Institution does not need to be an ADI or a RADI, it does not need to subscribe for shares in NPPA and nor does it need to install and support an NPP Payment Access Gateway. This has been the most popular way of accessing the NPP as organisations do not need to meet either the technical requirements required for direct connectivity nor the capital required to be an NPP Participant. The platform went live with over 50 Identified Institutions at launch, including many small financial institutions who were able to offer NPP payment services to their customers from day one. There are now approximately 65 organisations currently accessing the NPP this way and more are scheduled to come on board in coming months. Overlay Service Provider An Overlay Service is a product or service that uses the NPP infrastructure’s capabilities, potentially in a customised way to define a bespoke payment service or process. The first overlay service launched from the platform is Osko by BPAY. Through Osko, BPAY has defined the ‘messages’ or ‘rules’ that decide how an Osko payment will travel along the NPP in regard to speed, the type of information that goes with the payment and what the end customer experience is. Any organisation can become an Overlay Service Provider as long as it can demonstrate a sound business plan backed by the required expertise for their proposed product or service. Overlay Service Providers offer their product or service to NPP Participants and Identified Institutions to distribute to their customers. However, it is important to note that in our experience, many payments innovation or processes will not require an Overlay Service to be established but rather will be able to leverage the existing service and capabilities of the platform. Connected Institution Connected Institutions can connect to the NPP directly by installing an NPP Payment Access Gateway in their own environment in order to be able to send payment initiation and other non-value messages. This could include payroll providers, share registries, retailers, large corporates, fintechs or organisations like Amazon, Facebook and Google. Because these organisations are not directly processing or clearing payments they are not required to be an ADI or RADI. However, given a Connected Institution is directly connected to the NPP, and may also have direct access to the NPP Addressing Service, they are required to comply with the same technical requirements for connecting directly as apply to NPP Participants, including resilience, 24/7 availability, security and the ability to meet performance SLAs. End user Businesses, corporates and fintechs, just like individuals, can use the NPP to make and receive payments. There are currently more than 70 organisations offering services via the NPP. Participating financial institutions are gradually rolling out their NPP product and service offerings to their business and corporate customers (with retail customers largely complete) which will provide more organisations with the ability to make and receive NPP payments. NPP access eligibility criteria and governance The eligibility criteria for the different NPP access points are clear and transparent and are provided for in the NPP Regulations (with the exception of being an end user which is determined by individual participating institutions in terms of their specific customer offerings) and are published on our website (www.nppa.com.au) . The key requirements are summarised below: NPP Participant Identified Institution

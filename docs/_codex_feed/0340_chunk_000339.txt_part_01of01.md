is outlined in section 1.4 of this Appendix and must include the results of bench testing performed on the Printing System and/or evidence of all existing accreditations claimed by the Applicant in respect of the Printing System. AusPayNet will review the application and, if necessary, may request further information from the Applicant. Once an application is accepted, field testing takes place at the data centres of various Tier 1A Participating Members selected by AusPayNet. The results of the field testing are then reviewed by AusPayNet and AusPayNet will decide whether, on the basis of the results, the Printing System is capable of reliably producing MICR documents of an acceptable standard. The Applicant will be informed of AusPayNet’s decision and will have a right of re- test. AusPayNet may, in its absolute discretion, accept existing accreditations with other bodies as meeting part or all of the requirements of the accreditation process. Printing Systems that are capable of producing MICR encoding of an acceptable standard will be accredited and added to AusPayNet's Register of MICR Printing Systems (Register). Accreditation is subject to on-going evaluation. 1.4 Application for Testing Amended, effective 15/09/06 1.4.1 What Printing Systems may be the subject of an Application? A Printing System is the subject of an application for testing if: (a) It has a speed of 21 or greater A4 pages per minute, or a duty cycle of 75,000 or higher A4 pages/month. and/or (b) It has potential for high volume production due to the large number of installed units. and/or (c) The application for re-testing is nominated by an APCS Participating Member pursuant to section 1.9 of this Appendix. 1.4.2 The Application Amended, effective 15/09/06 An Applicant must submit an application for testing to AusPayNet prior to commencing field testing. A proforma application is available from AusPayNet upon request. At a minimum, the application must include details as to the following matters: (a) The nature of the Printing System to be tested eg. the make and model number; (b) The nomination for re-testing of the Printing System by an APCS Participating Member, if relevant, refer to section 1.4.1(c); (c) The written results of a successful bench test for the Printing System MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 64 AusPayNet September 2017 and/or a supporting submission by the Applicant if a successful bench test is not possible, refer to section 1.4.3. (d) Evidence of all existing accreditations with other bodies claimed by the Applicant in respect of the Printing System, refer to section 1.8. The Applicant must pay an application fee of $2,500 (subject to indexation in accordance with section 2.0 of this Appendix) to AusPayNet. This fee is intended to assist Tier 1A Participating Members nominated to conduct field testing to recoup their costs for out of pocket expenses incurred in conducting those tests. Such fee will be applied by AusPayNet towards the payment of costs and expenses of AusPayNet which would otherwise be borne by Tier 1A Participating Members pursuant to APCS Regulation 6.11. Where the application for testing is nominated by an APCS Participating Member, refer to section 1.9 of this Appendix. 1.4.3 What is bench testing? Bench testing is used to evaluate whether the Printing System conforms to its written specifications. An Applicant must have performed bench testing on the relevant Printing System prior to lodging their application with AusPayNet and the application for testing must include a report of the results of the bench testing and/or a supporting submission by the Applicant if a successful bench test is not possible. Test equipment used for bench testing must conform to ANSI X9.27-1995 part 3, section 6. The test methods outlined in section 6 of this ANSI Publication should be used as a basis for the bench testing and cover the following properties:  Dimensional/Optical measurement: - Character spacing/Alignment/Skew/Dimensions - Edge irregularity/Voids/Extraneous ink  Magnetic measurement: - Signal level - Uniformity of ink - Waveforms  Embossment/Debossment 1.4.4 AusPayNet's review of the Application Amended, effective 22/03/06 Upon receipt of the application, AusPayNet will review the application in preparation for the commencement of field testing and, if necessary, may request further information from the Applicant. AusPayNet may also impose conditions on the field testing if necessary to ensure that the overall objectives outlined above in section 1.2 are met. Once the application is accepted, AusPayNet will advise the Applicant:  that field testing will commence; and  of the Tier 1A Participating Members which will conduct the field testing. As a guide, AusPayNet will use reasonable endeavours to provide a response to the Applicant within a period of five weeks from the date the application is accepted by AusPayNet. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 65 AusPayNet September 2017 1.5 Field Testing Amended, effective 22/03/06 The field testing procedure is designed to examine the quality of the output of a Printing System when set up according to the Applicant's instructions and using paper that conforms to AS 2277. In particular, the aim of field testing is to check that the documents produced by the Printing System are sufficiently robust to perform satisfactorily on the reading equipment used by Tier 1A Participating Members. The assessment of the robustness of the document comprises of a series of test runs through the testing Members’ MICR reading equipment. The tests should cover the full range of machines used by Tier 1A Participating Members taking

transactions to socially engineer consumers to fall victim to higher-value remote access or bank impersonation scams. Effective mitigants Further amplifying the severity of this challenge, overseas CNP spending accounts for about 3 per cent of Australian card spend; however, it accounts for 51 per cent of all card fraud. Stopping card fraud is essential for two reasons: Maintaining consumer trust in the digital economy Reducing the risk of card fraud victims falling to other higher-value scams, such as bank impersonation or remote access scams. Unfortunately, unlike Australia, overseas merchants do not tend to implement SCA. We call on them to do so. While there is no one tool to stop all fraud and scams, SCA is a key mitigant for curbing card fraud. SCA uses multiple factors to verify a card user's identity and determine whether they are authorising a transaction. Often, the reasons why e-commerce merchants have concerns about SCA is implementation costs or cart abandonment rates due to increased transaction friction. Overseas e-commerce has become popular with Australians, whether online advertising, e-shopping or digital subscription services. In Australia, customers have become accustomed to friendly risk-based frictions, such as payment holds or added security questions, for certain at-risk transactions. Fraud prevention and driving trust in the digital economy are key aspects of a positive customer experience. An appropriate level of friction in the process – safety by design – can therefore provide a safer and more secure transaction process. We are working closely with card schemes, financial institutions, NASC and law enforcement agencies to understand the problem, explore new strategies and enhance existing security measures.

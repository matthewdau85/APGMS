that are suitable for monitoring low volume cheque printing, such as desk-top laser MICR printers. Typically they transport the cheque past the read-head and gives a simple display of the codeline and signal strength range or for individual characters. 7.4.4 Calibration Documents Calibration documents are required to periodically check and adjust the signal measurement of the MICR testers. These can be obtained from the suppliers of the test equipment and should be changed regularly as they deteriorate with use. Details of the calibration process are contained in the user documentation of MICR testers. These documents are known as secondary reference standards and their production is carefully monitored by ANSI. The documents are usually printed with a single domestic character in the centre of the codeline and have the measured signal strength individually noted on the document. Amended, effective 19/05/08 7.5 Quality Assurance Procedures The establishment of Quality Assurance Procedures is the responsibility of producers of MICR encoded documents and the Financial Institutions to which the documents are presented. The procedures cannot be rigidly prescribed, as they need to be appropriate for the size of the operation, the technology in use and the skill of the personnel in production and use of MICR documents. For example the problems likely to be encountered by letterpress printing of MICR will be very different from those experienced by operators of MICR laser printers. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 50 AusPayNet September 2017 The information presented here is a guide to the various methods and tools available to ensure that information printed on MICR documents is correctly positioned and that the MICR print quality standards are being met. These procedures also have to be supplemented by those for design, layout and colour as required by the Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms. Amended, effective 19/05/08 7.5.1 Optical Evaluation The MICR print specifications are based on optical dimensions and positioning thus the initial tests are simple optical tests. These can be carried out with the Position and Layout gauge, supplemented by the Optical Comparator. The document should be inserted in the Position and Layout gauge between the clear plastic overlay and the opaque backing material. It is to be position so that the bottom edge is aligned with the bottom of the pocket and the right-hand reference edge is exactly aligned with the right-hand end of the gauge (noted with an arrow). The document is then in position to examine the codeline. Figure 24 MICR Clear Band The bottom 5/8 inch of a document should be checked to see if it is clear of ink other than that for the printed characters and the background design if it intrudes into the area. The background should be MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 51 AusPayNet September 2017 printed in scan non-readable ink. Any extraneous ink or other printing that is present in scan-readable ink should be less than .004 inch by .004 inch (refer 2.2.6) and can be checked with the optical comparator. If incorrectly setup, laser printers can produce large numbers of small magnetic spots which need to be carefully checked for conformance. Laser printed signatures also need care to ensure they do not intrude into the 5/8 inch band, especially where they contain descending characters. Set-off Wet ink may “set-off” on the reverse of a sheet above it in a stack. Where this occurs on the reverse of the 5/8th inch MICR clear band, the same restrictions apply as for the front of the sheet. Position The BSB symbol is used as the reference character for position and should be in position 29 of the layout gauge’s codeline. If it is not, move the document horizontally until it is in position and check that the codeline falls within the horizontal and vertical tolerance limits as indicated on the gauge, (refer 2.3.5). Format and contents The information in the codeline is to be checked to ensure that the data is in the correct fields (refer section 3) and correctly conforms to the issuing Financial Institution’s Confirmatory Authority. Spacing The spacing of characters in individual fields must not vary by more than ± 0.010 inch and must not exceed the field limits (refer 2.1.3), additional tolerances apply between fields separated by a blank space. Alignment The bottom edge of characters must not vary more than ± 0.030 inch (refer 2.1.4), this can be checked with the Alignment scale on the gauge or more accurately with the optical comparator. Skew – character/field The gauge and comparator have scales to measure the skew which must be < 1.50 for characters and in any field of a codeline (refer 2.1.5). Dimensions The gauge has representations of characters at the nominal, maximum and minimum sizes. The codeline should be compared with these and if there is any doubt that the characters conform to standard, they should be checked with the pocket comparator and the grids shown in Appendix 2. This is particularly common for Letterpress and Offset printing as the operating conditions may vary to cause out of tolerance conditions. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 52 AusPayNet September 2017 A systematic deviation from standards could also be checked with the more accurate RDM OCR Qualifier and corrections made to the font by the typesetter or printer supplier.

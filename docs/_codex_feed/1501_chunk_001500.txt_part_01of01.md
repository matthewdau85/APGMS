To maintain compliance with the Digital Service Provider (DSP) Operational Security Framework (OSF), you will need to undertake an annual review, notify the Digital Partnership Office (DPO) of any changes to your operating environment, and report any data breaches immediately. We undertake regular ad-hoc reviews to ensure DSPs remain compliant with the requirements of the DSP OSF. On this page Annual reviews You must provide annual assurance that your products and services remain compliant with the controls and requirements of the DSP OSF. We will raise an OSF annual review ticket via the DSP service desk and email you instructions on the actions you should take for your annual review. The annual review includes a review of your self-assessment or independent certification currency. A self-assessment is deemed current for 2 years from the date of our initial approval. The validity of the independent certification currency is determined by the expiry date listed on the certificate.

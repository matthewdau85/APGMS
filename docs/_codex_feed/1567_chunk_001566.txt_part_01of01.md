They carry out the following actions on behalf of another DSP: 1. Facilitate the transformation of Single Touch Payroll (STP) compliant data received from an STP compliant solution. 2. Transmit STP conforming data to the ATO. This document provides guidance on using a SSP to meet your STP reporting obligations. Key terms For the purpose of this document, the following definitions apply. Key Terms Description Product registration The process undertaken by DSPs to use ATO digital services in production. The process includes: • whitelisting your product for use against a specific service • assessing your product against the requirements as established in the DSP Operational Framework, and • Product verification testing (PVT). Product ID The value associated with a software product that produces STP Compliant data and must be included in the message sent to the ATO. STP Business implementation guide (STP BIG) Provides guidance on: • the business context surrounding the functionality of the design requirements for STP • how an employer meets their taxation obligations under Division 389 of Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 – Reporting by employers (Single Touch Payroll). STP compliant product A software product which is developed in compliance with the STP BIG. Introduction DSP Guide Using a SSP to meet STP reporting obligations OFFICIAL EXTERNAL 4 DSP Operational Framework Addresses the risks associated with the digital transfer of tax and superannuation related data. The framework outlines how we will provide access to and monitor the transfer of data to help protect the integrity of the tax and superannuation systems which support the Australian community. ebMS3 A set of layered extensions to the simple object access protocol (SOAP), providing security and reliability features enabling e-Commerce transactions. The ATO uses the ebMS3 standard. STP reports The generic name for reporting the submission of either the pay event or update event. Services available to SSPs The digital services available to SSPs are listed in table 1 below. As PAYEVNT.0002 2017 is now deprecated, this version of the service is no longer available for new SSPs and their DSP clients. Business Service Service Name Action Name Payroll Event v3 http://sbr.gov.au/ato/payevnt/2018 Submit.003.00 Payroll Event v3 http://sbr.gov.au/ato/payevnt/2018 Update.003.00 Tax file number declaration http://sbr.gov.au/ato/tfnd/2017 Submit.004.00 Tax file number declaration http://sbr.gov.au/ato/tfnd/2019 Submit.005.00 Table 1: Services in scope Using an SSP If you are planning to use a SSP you will need to: • ensure your product outputs STP compliant data. Work with your SSP to understand the various formats they support • supply authorisation information to your SSP outside of the business payload • supply product details (for EVTE and production) for your SSP to include in the Payroll Event (PAYEVNT) message properties of the ebMS3 header • work with your SSP to complete conformance testing. The type of SSP solution will determine the amount and type of conformance testing required. DSP Guide Using a SSP to meet STP reporting obligations OFFICIAL EXTERNAL 5 A SSP can validate data using schema and validation rules but cannot modify the contents of the data you supply them. Note: • Your product should be STP compliant. • Extended Conformance Testing needs to be completed (if required). • You will still need to meet the applicable requirements as established through the DSP Operational Security Framework. Output data We have categorised the output of a STP solution into two groups: 1. STP compliant data - the output from a software solution which complies with the STP BIG. It outputs all necessary data required to meet the schema needs of PAYEVNT. The STP compliant data can be in any proprietary format such as CSV, TXT or XML. 2. STP conforming data - uses STP compliant data to undertake validation using the ATO issued schema and validation rules. As a SSP cannot modify the data you send to them, you are responsible for creating STP compliant data. Throughout the whitelisting process of your product any errors in data will be returned to you to be actioned. You must ensure your product is capable of supporting end users dealing with these errors. Authorisation information required To correctly form the PAYEVNT message to send to the ATO, you need to provide your SSP with details which ensure the message remains well formed and authorisations between the sender, intermediary (registered agent or business appointment) and reporting party (employer) are valid. The diagram below represents all authorisation scenarios currently supported by SBR ebMS3.

The Member Incident Plan provides a framework for Management Committee communication and consultation during applicable contingency events. If the Chief Executive Officer invokes the Member Incident Plan, the Management Committee will comply with its requirements.323 Note: Clause 9.7 relates to a Framework Participant Disabling event, clause 9.17 relates to a central site (RITS or CSI) Disabling Event, and clause 9.19 relates 320 Last amended effective 1/1/18, version 037 r&p 001.17 321 Last amended effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 322 Last amended effective 1/1/18, version 037 r&p 001.17 323 Last amended effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES PART 10: TRANSITION ARRANGEMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 69 to a SWIFT Network Disabling Event.324 9.21 FIN-Copy Operating in Bypass Mode [Deleted]325 9.22 Decision to Abandon Y-Copy Processing [Deleted]326 9.23 SWIFT PDS Payment Instructions Processed in Bypass Mode [Deleted]327 9.24 CLS Payments [Deleted]328 9.25 Future Dated Payments in Bypass Mode [Deleted]329 9.26 Deferred Status Payments in Bypass Mode [Deleted]330 9.27 Possible Duplicated Settlement Amounts [Deleted]331 9.28 Fallback Period332 (a) The Chief Executive Officer may, in consultation with the System Administrator, declare that a specified period is to be a Fallback Period.

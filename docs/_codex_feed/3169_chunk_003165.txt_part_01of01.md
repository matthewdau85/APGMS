your Vendors for help with questions to ask your vendor or service provider. SEE PAGE 22 PCI-approved secure card readers and payment terminals that encrypt card data do it using technology called “Secure Reading and Exchange of Data (SRED)” - ask your vendor if your payment terminal encrypts card data with SRED. E-commerce websites must encrypt card data that is sent over the Internet, for example, using something called transport-layer security (TLS). Ask your service provider how they encrypt your card data. Your data is vulnerable when it travels to your merchant bank, and when it’s kept or stored on your computers and devices. The best way to keep it safe is to make it useless even if it’s stolen by encrypting it whenever you store it or send it, and removing it altogether when it’s not needed. While this can be more complex to put in place, in the long run, it can make security much easier to manage. What is tokenization? See page 14 for an explanation. 24 Data Security Essentials for Small Merchants: Guide to Safe Payments Copyright 2024 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

In April, the fifth Standards and Requirements Working Group meeting was held, where Members endorsed the latest version of the AES Technical Blueprint Handbook, representing the target state that could be used for migrating to AES. The handbook will be taken to the Issuers and Acquirers Forum (IAF) for approval. The third Migration Planning Working Group was also held in April. Members were presented with a proposal on the principles, approach, and assumptions to be adopted for the AES Migration Plan (as set out in the Migration Strategy (Approach and Plan)). Following approval of the Industry Testing Working Group Terms of Reference at the IAF meeting in March, a testing consultancy has been engaged to deliver the following plans in 2024: Industry Testing Assessment of requirements for the migration Industry Testing Strategy (Approach and Plan) for the migration Industry Testing Inputs for assurance of the AES Migration Program. The Member nominations for the Industry Testing Working Group were requested in April, with the first meeting due to be held in June. A Member Readiness Survey was issued to the Issuers and Acquirers Community in April. The survey results will provide an understanding to AusPayNet of Member readiness for an AES migration and confidence in the AES Migration Program; they will be anonymised, summarised, and provided to the IAF in due course. Further surveys will be issued in August and November, and the results will provide input to development of an overall Change Management Plan for the AES Migration Program.

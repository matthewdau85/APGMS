Many legislative instruments are automatically repealed after 10 years - this process is known as sunsetting and is governed by Part 4 of the Legislation Act 2003 (the LA). As part of this process: the Attorney-General is required to table a list of all the instruments due to sunset on a given sunset date; and this list must be tabled in each House of the Parliament on the first sitting day within 18 months before that date (section 52 of the LA). The exact date/s of tabling will depend on when each House of the Parliament is sitting. For an up-to-date list of all the instruments due to sunset please refer to the Sunsetting page for a list of Due to Sunset, and Exempt from Sunsetting. Lists tabled to date The following lists were current when prepared, but are subject to change (for example, because an instrument has been repealed, or because its sunset date has been changed under sections 51, 51A or 53 of the LA). The full text of each listed instrument and information about its current status is available by using the links within each list. Further information about an instrument may be requested from the administering department or its relevant agencies as applicable. Note 1: These lists were accurate when published but do not reflect current rules for calculating sunset dates as amended in 2011 and 2012. Note 2: This list reflects the special sunset rule set out in section 103 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 , which applies the LA regime but with 2 yearly rather than 10 yearly sunsetting for certain instruments. Next list A list of all the legislative instruments that are due to sunset on 1 April 2027 is required to be tabled on the first sitting day on or after 1 October 2025.

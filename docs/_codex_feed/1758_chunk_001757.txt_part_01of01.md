Australian Payments Plus (AP+) is excited to announce that it is partnering with global payment technology leader Giesecke+Devrient (G+D) to develop eftpos Click to Pay with integrated least-cost routing (LCR). The introduction of LCR for Click to Pay is a world first for online debit card payments. Click to Pay is an online checkout experience that allows consumers to make fast, convenient and secure purchases without manually entering card details. Click to Pay with eftpos also gives merchants the benefit of automated routing to the most cost-effective payment network through LCR. “Click to Pay with eftpos combines the seamless, secure online checkout experience customers expect with the added benefit of least-cost routing – helping put downward pressure on the cost of accepting payments,” said Adrian Lovney, Chief Payments and Schemes Officer at AP+. eftpos Click to Pay transactions are processed using tokenisation, which replaces real card details (like card numbers) with a digital token. This token can be used for transactions but is useless if stolen, protecting sensitive card data. Meanwhile, payments routed over the eftpos network leverage AP+’s domestic payments infrastructure, ensuring Australian data is processed in line with domestic security and privacy standards. “Through our partnership with G+D, we’re bringing world-class security and innovation to a uniquely local solution that supports the broader payments ecosystem,” added Lovney. Key features: Integrated least-cost routing to lower the cost of accepting payments One-click checkout with no need to enter card details Tokenised payments to ensure the security of credentials Trusted local infrastructure , supporting resilience and data sovereignty “G+D is proud to partner with AP+ in the delivery of its Click to Pay solution, enabling eftpos in these digital payment flows. This is a global first dual-network debit card implementation, providing Australian consumers a secure and simplified experience,” said CEO of G+D e-Payments, Gabrielle Bugat. The solution is currently being piloted and will start rolling out from early 2026. Least-cost routing: lowering the cost of payments Most debit cards in Australia are dual-network cards, which allow payments to be processed either via the domestic eftpos network or an international card network, each with different cost implications. When LCR is supported, the merchant can choose to automatically route the payment to the lowest-cost network. While LCR is widely enabled for in-store payments (70%) and increasingly for mobile wallets (30%), online guest checkout payments have historically lacked this functionality. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has consistently supported the broader availability of LCR as a way to promote competition and reduce payment costs for merchants. In an April 2024 report [1] , the RBA found that the cost of accepting debit card transactions is nearly 20% lower for merchants that have LCR turned on compared with those with LCR turned off. Extending LCR to online guest checkout through Click to Pay aligns with this objective, bringing more choice and control into the digital payments environment. “Enabling least-cost routing in the online Click to Pay experience is an important evolution in how businesses in Australia can manage the cost of accepting payments,” said Lovney. “It aligns with the RBA’s policy direction, with our own commitment to lowering the cost of payments, supports greater competition in card payments, and delivers more options for merchants.” About G+D Giesecke+Devrient (G+D) is a global security technology company, specialising in digital security, tokenisation solutions, card manufacturing, financial platforms, and currency technology.

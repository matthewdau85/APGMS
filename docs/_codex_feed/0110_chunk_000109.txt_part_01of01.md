data obtained from BECS-related Payment System Market Share (PSMS) and other BECS-related industry initiatives, will inform AusPayNet's updates on the target end-date for the Framework to its Members and key stakeholders. Collaborate with industry We continue to collaborate with regulators and industry participants on the BECS transition-related initiatives. In September, the RBA hosted a webinar with financial institutions (attended by AusPayNet) to provide the initial observations of the RBA’s BECS Transition Risk Assessment and next steps. Coordinate the migration The process for transitioning away from BECS presents complex challenges for the industry, challenges that cannot be effectively or efficiently addressed by any one industry participant working alone. Recognising this, we have consulted with industry participants and regulators in relation to potential industry-wide coordination to work towards a desired end state for account-to-account payments in Australia. Subject to regulatory approvals, the scope of potential coordination and desired end state will be further discussed and developed in the early part of 2025. Community of Interest Network (COIN) The migration to the new COIN, provided by Transaction Network Solutions (TNS), was completed on Friday, 6 September. The new COIN connects its 20 members to a high availability, managed network for multilateral secure transmission of payment files between participants. The migration involved significant collaboration between the COIN members, TNS and AusPayNet, and represents a positive uplift in the level of resilience for the payments supported by the COIN. Cross-border payments The Financial Stability Board (FSB) continues work on its G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments: Priorities for the next phase of work and Priority actions for achieving the G20 Targets . In October, the FSB released its Annual Progress Report on Meeting the Targets for Cross-border Payments: 2024 Report on Key Performance Indicators . The report shows limited progress towards achieving the targets across wholesale, retail and remittance market segments, but it also acknowledges that it will take time for results from work undertaken under the G20 Roadmap to materialise. Interlinking fast payment systems The cross-border payments evolution in the ASEAN Region is rapidly occurring. Significantly, in October, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced that its TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) service is joining Project Nexus, subject to the live implementation of Nexus. ECB will also explore a bilateral link with India’s Unified Payments Interface, the world’s largest instant payment system. Together, these bring enormous scale to cross-border payments being made via domestic instant payment systems, which will help in delivering on the G20 targets. Locally, on 1 October, AP+ announced that ANZ, Bendigo Bank, CBA, Citi, HSBC, ING, NAB, RBA, Westpac Bank, Bank of Melbourne, BankSA, St George Bank, Wise and several financial institutions sponsored by ANZ, ASL, Cuscal and Indue have joined the International Payments Service (IPS). Cross-Border Payments Round-Up In September, we published the latest edition of the Cross-Border Payments Round-Up , a biannual newsletter providing updates on the progress of the G20 Roadmap. Read the newsletter on our website . ISO 20022 migration AusPayNet’s 50 HVCS Participants are now fully migrated to the use of ISO 20022. With completion of the domestic HVCS migration, participants must now focus on the next phase of the program: the implementation of updated HVCS message specifications. The final Migration Monitor newsletter will cover the migration completion in further detail. This newsletter will be published on our website in the coming weeks. Economic crime Through our Economic Crime Forum, we continue to bring together a broad range of participants to share intelligence on emerging threats and collaborate on joint responses or tactical initiatives to prevent all types of economic crime. In preventing economic crime, we are better together. This week, to mark International Fraud Awareness Week, AusPayNet released Australian payment fraud statistics for the July 2023 to June 2024 financial year (FY24). You can access the latest data via our website and Member Portal. We have also published a blog post this week that takes a closer look at the figures. Stakeholder engagement Stakeholder Advisory Council AusPayNet’s Stakeholder Advisory Council met in August. At this meeting, we sought the Council’s feedback and perspectives on our payment policy priorities, the Government's plan to wind-down the cheques system, the transition from BECS, and AusPayNet's corporate strategy review. The Council’s feedback from both the June and August meetings was presented back to the Board at their meeting in August. At a time of significant regulatory reforms to the payments system and the continual refining of our governance structure, the Council members play a critical role in sharing their different views and perspectives. Our Board values our stakeholders’ views and we look forward to continuing to build strong relationships with you in 2025.

Economic Crime Roundtable Economic crime remains a key strategic issue for our Members.

We received excellent feedback on the roundtable from those in attendance. We would like to thank our guest presenters from the National Anti-Scam Centre, Cuscal, Monoova, the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange, AP+ and all participants for sharing their insights and perspectives.

must be correctly stored and secured in accordance with PCI DSS requirements. Additionally, the capture and storage of screens or video recordings where CHD is visible must be equally secured. Every possible effort must be made to eliminate SAD from the telephone environment. If an organization has a legitimate constraint that prevents it from removing SAD from its recordings, the organization should discuss this with its acquirer and/or payment brand. If SAD cannot be eliminated, it must be secured in a manner consistent with PCI DSS and must not be able to be queried Appendix D, “Call Recording Decision-making Process,” illustrates some high-level decision points related to the presence of SAD in call recordings. CHD should only be stored as necessary to meet the needs of the business and, to comply with local laws and regulations. If any CHD is stored, an appropriate data-retention policy to ensure that the data is stored only when absolutely necessary should be implemented. Storage should be kept to a minimum, and a secure disposal procedure should be in place to delete the data as soon as it is no longer needed. Specific considerations around storage of account data to avoid unauthorized access to SAD include:  Backups and archives of the recording solution must also be protected and should not provide a backdoor to the solution. Consider storing call-recording archives on a system or media that is not connected to a network.  Implement strong authentication controls for all personnel with access to voice and screen recordings, and for any other storage of CHD. Ensure that personnel do not share user IDs and passwords.  Restrict logical access to recordings and CRM data containing payment card data based on the individual’s business need. For example, by implementing screen-recording-playback interfaces that display payment card information only to managers, and having it blacked out (or masked) for all other personnel.  All interaction with the recordings should be logged according to PCI DSS Requirement 10.  Systems storing CHD may be located on a secured internal network that is segregated from Internet- facing networks and other untrusted networks.  PAN data must be rendered unreadable. This can be done by using strong cryptography to encrypt the entire PAN, one-way hashing it, truncating it, or replacing it with a token anywhere it is stored, including in voice and screen recordings, databases, log files, and back-up media.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 26 Note: If truncated PANs and hashed pans are both present an entity’s environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN.  Remember that storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization is not permitted, even if the data is encrypted. If any recordings include card verification code data, the organization must ensure that all SAD is securely deleted from the recording or is otherwise rendered unrecoverable upon completion of the authorization process. Where possible, implement processes and technologies that prevent CHD from entering the telephone environment and prevent SAD from being recorded in the first place.  If a technology solution (e.g., pause-and-resume or stop-start) cannot block the audio or video from being stored, the sensitive authentication data (SAD) MUST BE DELETED from the recording as soon as the transaction is processed.  Where pause-and-resume is used for call recordings, especially where initiated by the agent, it is recommended to verify that the call recordings do not contain CHD or SAD be undertaken on a regular basispreferably weekly.  Gaps in security coverage can occur when call and screen-recording services are provided by a third party. Entities should develop a payment card data flow that marks each entity’s area of responsibility so that business agreements among organizations clearly communicate expectations and responsibilities. The PCI SSC provides a great deal of supplementary guidance information. A list of relevant documents is available in Appendix G.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 27 6 Approach to Scoping and Securing Telephone Environments Organizations should ensure that appropriate security controls are in place covering people, process, and technology wherever account data is stored, processed, or transmitted. The best way to do this is adopting and implementing the latest version of the PCI DSS, as summarized below. A link to the full version of the document is available in Appendix G. PCI Data Security Standard – High-Level Overview Build and Maintain a Secure Network 1. Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data 2. Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters Protect Cardholder Data 3. Protect stored cardholder data 4. Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program 5. Protect all systems against malware and regularly update anti-virus software or programs 6. Develop and maintain secure systems and applications Implement Strong Access Control Measures 7. Restrict access to cardholder data by business need to know 8. Identify and authenticate access to system components 9. Restrict physical access to cardholder data Regularly Monitor and Test Networks 10. Track

explainable, responsible AI across every industry. We’re entering an era where it’s not enough for AI to be powerful, it needs to be understandable, auditable, and aligned with human intent. Whether it’s in healthcare, financial services, or fraud prevention, the trend I’m watching closely is the rise of agentic AI systems that can act autonomously and explain their reasoning in real time. This impacts both compliance and trust. I’m also energized by the convergence of AI and cybersecurity. Security systems now anticipate and adapt to threats in milliseconds using real-time behavioral modelling, rather than just reacting to known risks. It’s like giving your fraud defenses a sixth sense. But what excites me most isn’t just the tech. It’s the maturing mindset behind it. We’re finally having the right conversations about governance, fairness, risk, and accountability at the same pace we are innovating. And that, to me, is the most exciting shift of all.

at rest covers data stored for the purpose of Taxation, Accounting, Payroll, Business Registry and Superannuation transactions including Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The approved symmetric encryption algorithms are Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) using key lengths of 128, 192 and 256 bits, and Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) and three distinct keys as per the Australian Government Guidelines for using cryptography . DSPs can choose to apply this control by either encrypting the disk, container, application, or database. Alternatively, you may choose to apply partial encryption to data at the block, field, or column level but this must cover data that is stored for the purpose of Taxation, Accounting, Payroll, Business Registry and Superannuation transactions including Personally Identifiable Information (PII). If you have implemented encryption at rest, further controls are recommended. More information on implementing network segmentation and segregation can be found at ACSC Implementing Network Segmentation and Segregation . Evidence required One of the following: Screenshot showing encryption enabled, confirmation of method of encryption applied, and algorithm used Licensing agreement or invoice with whitepaper Policies relating to data classification when applying block, field, or column level encryption Where encryption at rest is not viable, provide a screenshot/policy which demonstrates all the below have been met User/system role-based access controls and active logging and monitoring protocols Restricting or limiting access to databases using the principle of least privilege Separation of hosts and segregation of networks or micro segmentation Intrusion Prevention and detection controls. Further information is available at ACSC Implementing Network Segmentation and Segregation . Encryption in transit This requirement seeks to protect the confidentiality and integrity of Taxation, Accounting, Payroll, Business Registry and Superannuation information in transit. You are required to provide evidence that an approved protocol TLS 1.3 or higher is used as per ACSC Guidelines for using Cryptography and Annex A of ACSC Implementing Certificates, TLS and HTTPS . Evidence required All cloud products must provide one of the following: Back-end configuration of TLS (for example, load balancer) SSL labs report for public certificates. All indirectly connecting products must provide one of the following: Licensing agreement with SSP Screenshots from SSP portal Screenshot of API call to 3rd party showing TLS protocol. Note : Desktop products that directly connect to the ATO are not required to provide evidence for this requirement. Entity Validation Entity validation ensures that the consumer or user of a commercial software product is a legitimate business and has a genuine need to access a DSPs software. To complete entity validation, you must verify the entity against a reliable and independent source such as the Australian Business Register. Additionally, you must obtain valid client contact details that includes a confirmed email and phone number. When a consumers does not have an ABN, for example a student using software for research purposes, you are required to validate their contact information only. Note: Entity validation does not negate the need for DSPs to meet specific service requirements relating to verification. For example, SuperMatch requires specific customer verification requirements as part of the terms of use. Evidence required DSPs need to provide evidence that demonstrates entity validation is in place as part of the product registration/purchase process. Personnel Security This requirement seeks to mitigate threats from malicious internal actors (otherwise known as trusted insiders). You need to demonstrate appropriate processes and procedures are in place for hiring, managing and terminating employees and contractors. Processes and procedures may include (but are not limited to): Identity proofing or pre-employment screening Previous employment checks Police checks Employee obligations Separation activities Note: Micro DSPs, those with one or two employees, are exempt from this requirement unless contractors or non-employees have access to source code or Taxation, Accounting, Payroll, Business Registry or Superannuation related information. Evidence required Internal policy documents detailing how employees maintain confidentiality of enterprise information Process descriptions detailing pre-employment screening and separation procedures Sample contracts detailing conditions of employment. Security monitoring This requirement seeks to minimise the risk and impact of cyber incidents by having controls in place to detect, prevent and respond to cyber-attacks. Monitoring is a joint responsibility between us and you. We expect DSPs to be able to demonstrate that: appropriate processes and procedures are in place to monitor networks, applications and transactions you regularly scan your environment for threats and take appropriate action when anomalies are detected. Evidence required Screenshot of an intrusion detection system such as a firewall that generates alerts Approach to detect anomalies or a screenshot of a security event and incident management dashboard Intrusion prevention system which protects end points and scans the DSP environment to prevent malicious events Policy demonstrating actions that will be taken where anomalies are detected. Supply Chain Visibility of the supply chain allows for the identification of entities (and the functional roles within) that are involved in the transmission of information that generates the payload to the ATO. This includes details of any third-party connections to your product or service via APIs. The functional roles within a supply chain can be defined as: Data collector: party responsible for the acquisition of data through a user interface interaction or APIs. Data validator: party responsible for the verification of data types, structures, formats and/or data values. Data integrator: party responsible for combining data from multiple sources for use. Data analysis and extraction: party responsible for extracting and /or performing analysis on data. Data transformer: party responsible for changing the representation of

​​ Australian Payments Plus (AP+) has opened a consultation to collect feedback from stakeholders and end users of account-to-account payments on their needs for the future capability of the NPP. This NPP-specific consultation paper is being conducted alongside the joint consultation paper AP+ launched today on the future vision for account-to-account payments. As more sectors adopt digital account-to-account payments, there is growing demand for the NPP to support a broader range of use cases. This consultation seeks to ensure that the NPP’s next phase of development aligns with market priorities and caters to end user needs. “As use cases for the NPP continue to grow, we’re engaging with stakeholders to understand what enhancements are needed to support their evolving requirements,” said AP+ CEO Lynn Kraus. “This consultation is focused on practical next steps – ensuring the NPP continues to deliver the capabilities users need.” The consultation paper focuses on two key priorities: Bulk payments : AP+ is seeking input on the functionality required to support processing of bulk files containing large volumes of payments, to understand how these can be efficiently supported by the NPP. Capability enhancements : AP+ is also inviting input on the development of additional NPP features, including a standard payment instruction format. Responses to the consultation will be used as input to the bulk design considerations and future capability roadmap development for the NPP. This work forms part of AP+’s broader engagement with industry to support the continued development of a modern, inclusive and future-ready payments system in Australia. -The full consultation paper and more information can be found on the AP+ website https://www.auspayplus.com.au/stakeholder-engagement/public-consultations . -Submissions to this consultation should be submitted by 5pm on Thursday 31 July 2025 via [email protected] .

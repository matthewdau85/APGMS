SET VOLUME 6 – ATM SYSTEM CODE ANNEXURE G. EMV@ATM TERMINAL STANDARDS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 121 Nothing in this clause is intended to limit the Issuer in prescribing service codes appropriate to the application and its intended usage e.g., service code indicating domestic usage only). (f) Cryptogram validation As the Transaction amount (DE4) may not be available to the Card for cryptogram generation, cryptogram verification shall use TAG 9F02 amount authorised, from DE55 which shall be populated by the Acquirer (ATM) to reflect the actual value provided to the Card for cryptogram generation. (g) Contactless mode Australian IC Cards providing a contactless interface shall support Contactless-EMV mode. (h) Second presentment Cards should be personalised to not require second presentment. Issuer features Neither Issuer Identification Data nor Issuer scripts are to be returned in the response message to an ATM Transaction initiated through the contactless interface. As ATMs may not validate the card settings, Issuers should be aware that they may receive ATM Transactions even if: (i) Support for ATMs is not included in the Application Usage Control (ii) Support for on-line PIN is not included in the CVM list (a) Card Management The Issuer should manage the offline counters and parameters for the contactless interface during the authorisation response to a contact chip transaction. They cannot be managed during a contactless Transaction as the Issuer Authentication Data from the authorization response is never delivered to the Card. Terminal Features ATM Terminals should perform application selection using the PPSE on the Card. Partial AID matching is recommended for all ATM Terminals. ATM Terminals are not required to perform off-line card authentication. ATM Terminals are not required to support second presentment. (a) Application Selection IAC CODE SET VOLUME 6 – ATM SYSTEM CODE ANNEXURE G. EMV@ATM TERMINAL STANDARDS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 122 The highest priority available payment application must be selected automatically by the ATM Terminal, when a contactless Card is presented. ATM Terminals, for such Transactions must support application selection without Cardholder assistance. If priorities have not been set in the Card, then the application selected will be determined by the Terminal. Terminals must maintain an independent list of AIDs accepted by the Terminal for contactless payments. (b) Off-line PIN verification As on-line Cardholder verification is required for all ATM Transactions, The ATM’s contactless interface should not support off-line PIN verification (see G7.4). (Note: this means that support for Device Cardholder Verification (Mastercard), Mobile Pin or mPIN shall not be provided.) (c) Cryptogram generation The amount authorised, provided to the Card for cryptogram generation shall be reflected in TAG 9F02, amount authorised and passed to the Issuer in DE55. (d) Data Usage Contactless Acquirers must only use data read from the contactless interface for contactless Transactions. Data obtained from the contactless interface must not be used for any another purpose or Transaction type. (e) Receipts The application preferred name (Tag 9F12) may be printed on the receipt in lieu of the AID if the code table is supported. Messaging (a) POS Entry Mode (DE22) Transactions initiated via the contactless interface shall set positions 1 and 2 of the Point of service entry mode (DE22) to 07, Contactless ICC (see AS2805-2 clause 4.4.10) (a) Response Codes (DE39) Response codes 01 – Refer to Card Issuer and 04 – Pick up Crd should not be used for contactless Transactions. (b) Processing Code As a contactless Transaction may occur before any service has been selected, i.e., to wake up the ATM, the value of the Transaction Type (Tag 9C in DE.55) may differ from the processing code sent in DE3. IAC CODE SET VOLUME 6 – ATM SYSTEM CODE ANNEXURE G. EMV@ATM TERMINAL STANDARDS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 123 ATMs must be able to generate Transactions where the value of Transaction Type (Tag 9C) is different from the value of the Processing Code in DE.3. If a contactless Transaction (tap) is used to wake up the ATM before any ATM service has been selected, the ATM must use a value of 93 for the Transaction Type (tag 9C) sent in the Generate AC command. Transaction Processing This clause contains an overview of the preferred processing flows for contactless Transactions. These are examples only and alternative flows are permitted. The requirements include ATM wake-up and chained contactless Transactions. (a) ATM Wake-up The preferred Transaction flow, where ATM processing commences by the Cardholder selecting a particular ATM option, and then entering the requested amount is shown in Figure G.9.5A below. In this case the ATM subsequently requests the Cardholder to tap, then using the highest priority application on the Card, the ATM initiates a full EMV withdrawal Transaction by requesting an ARQC with the Transaction amount (tag 9F02) equal to the requested cash amount and the Transaction type (tag 9C) equal to cash withdrawal (01). On successful completion of the contactless exchange the ATM completes its existing processes for Card validation and online PIN entry and sending a financial transaction request message (0200). No further interaction with the Card is required. The ATM returns to the idle state once the process is complete. The preferred Transaction flow where the ATM is opened by presenting the contactless Card (tapping) is shown in Figure G.9.5B below. The ATM moves from the idle state when the Card or device enters the reader’s field. The

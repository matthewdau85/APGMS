OFFICIAL EXTERNAL Reasonable use of ATO digital wholesale services VERSION CONTROL Version Release date Author Description of changes 1.0 30/06/2020 Digital Partnership Office Initial release 1.1 20/02/2025 Digital Partnership Office Addition of exception to EVTE rule Reasonable use of ATO digital wholesale services Policy intent and scope This policy outlines the ATO’s expectations on reasonable use of ATO Standard Business Reporting services and complements service specific usage restrictions described within relevant Business Implementation Guides. Together, they aim to ensure high levels of availability and responsiveness for all users. The scope of this policy applies to both production and test environments. The policy 1. The SBR Single Request Processor (SRP) should be utilised in software where an immediate response is required to support human interaction, or where BBRP is unavailable. 2. The SBR Bulk and Batch Request Processor (BBRP) must be used: • for bulk lodgment transmissions to the ATO i.e. greater than 5 lodgments, or • where services are automatically initiated by the software without human interaction, or • where an immediate response is not required – this includes, but not limited to, pre-loading client data for later interaction and end of day processing. 3. Software products that use functionality to stockpile transactions should be designed to release the backlog in a gradual controlled manner and not push them concurrently through SBR. 4. Automated calls to the SBR Bulk and Batch Request Processor (BBRP) should not repeatedly submit the same payload/message that has been previously rejected with a valid error message. 5. Building automated tools (such as, screen scrapers and bots) which extract data from Direct ATO digital services (e.g. Online Services for Agents) must not be used within your software. 6. Digital Service Providers (DSPs) are required to monitor usage and detect abnormal patterns, where it is within their control. The ATO will also actively monitor system usage and will notify DSPs in the event it is outside expected patterns. A breach of the Reasonable use policy may result in one or more of the following actions: • a direction to modify your system usage • limiting the speed at which you can access the service • suspending your access to the service • terminating your access to the service (for digital services providers, this includes de-whitelisting your product). 7. ATO test environments must only be used for testing of conformance data and must not be used for performance testing. In limited circumstances, testing beyond individual conformance tests may be allowed by negotiation only. Further guidelines Digital Service Providers that consume superannuation services, should review relevant service documentation which may include validation services. ato.gov.au

2027, as set out in the FSB’s Final Report. The benchmarks for the four challenges are set out in full in Appendix 1 below. The G20 Leaders Declaration (Appendix 2, Section 41) also welcomed and encouraged the continued analysis of the potential role of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) in enhancing cross-border payments and the wider implications of their use for the international monetary system. The roadmap will run over five years, with various stages of activity and implementation. The focus for 2022 is to complete further analysis but also to develop specific proposals for material improvement of underlying systems and arrangements. What's Planned for 2022 Financial Stability Board In 2022, the FSB will consult on the best approach in collating KPIs around the four challenges of cost, speed, access and transparency. FSB will, in partnership with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB), produce guidance on aspects of anti-money laundering, counter-terrorism financing, digital IDs and know your customer (KYC) standards. Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures have commenced work on multi-lateral service level agreements among cross-border payment schemes. CPMI will also work on area such as liquidity bridges, interlinking of domestic payment systems for cross-border payments and harmonising API protocols. As consultations and artefacts are produced, AusPayNet, through CBPAC, will coordinate responses and activities to ensure the Australian payments industry is represented and prepared. Taking forward the roadmap - CPMI milestones committed for 2022 We look forward to working with you through 2022 and beyond.

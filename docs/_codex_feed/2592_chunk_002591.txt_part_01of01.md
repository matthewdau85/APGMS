Such process must require, and provide instruction for, notifying the customer in writing of the Incident and related findings, and informing the customer of its obligations to notify the Participating Payment Brands in accordance with each Participating Payment Brands’ notification requirements. The customer notification must be documented and retained in accordance with the CPSA Company’s evidence-retention policy, along with a summary of the Incident and what actions were taken in connection with the Incident and corresponding discovery and/or notification. CPSA Companies and CPSA Employees are required to be familiar with the obligations for reporting Incidents to each of the Participating Payment Brands. If a PFI investigation is required by a Participating Payment Brand, a CPSA Company or CPSA Employee shall take no action after an Incident that is reasonably likely to diminish the integrity of, or otherwise interfere with or negatively affect the ability of a PCI Forensic Investigator to perform, any “PFI Investigation” (see the PCI Forensic Investigator (PFI) Program Guide for additional details). Failure to provide such written notification to the customer or otherwise comply with any of the above (or any other) CPSA Qualification Requirements constitutes a “Violation” (see Section 6.3 below) and may result in remediation, revocation, and/or termination of the CPSA Agreement.

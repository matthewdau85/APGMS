real-time media and data transmission protocols such as RTP or SRTP. In addition, VoIP relies on various open-source and proprietary audio and video codecs that optimize the media stream based on application requirements and network bandwidth.

D2.2 All other Entities For all other entities, every possible effort must be made to eliminate sensitive authentication data from the telephone environment. If an organization has a legitimate constraint that prevents it from removing SAD from its recordings, the organization should discuss this with its acquirer and/or payment brand. In these circumstances, there must be a detailed justification why sensitive authentication data cannot be eliminated (for example, a legislative or regulatory obligation7) and a comprehensive risk assessment performed at least annually and upon significant changes to the environment. The detailed justification, risk- assessment results, and documentation of the controls in place (and validated) to ensure that SAD cannot be queried must be made available to the acquiring bank and/or payment card brand as applicable to allow them to accept or reject the solution in place. If sensitive authentication data cannot be eliminated, it must be secured in a manner consistent with PCI DSS and must not be able to be queried. Data that can be retrieved through use of a search tool or by issuing a system instruction/task or a set of instructions/tasks is considered able to be queried. Examples of instructions/tasks that could result in data being retrieved include but are not limited to:  Defined searches based on character sets or data format  Database query functions  Decryption mechanisms  Sniffer tools  Data-mining functions  Data-analysis tools  Built-in utilities for sorting, collating, or retrieving data 7 PCI DSS does not supersede local or regional laws, government regulations, or other legal requirements.

For SAD to be considered “non-queryable,” it must not be able to be retrieved or listened to using the types of functions listed above. An example of an approach that may help to render SAD non-queryable could include, but not be limited to, the following steps: a) Remove call recordings from the call-recording solution. Ensure deleted recordings cannot be recovered from the call-recording system. b) Take the call recordings offline. For example, store the call recordings on a system that is not connected to the network, or store recordings on offline media. c) Physically secure the call recordings. For example, lock physical media in a safe or locate offline system in a secure area with restricted access. d) Enforce dual-access (as per “Dual Control” in the PCI DSS glossary) controls to the call recordings. e) Allow only single call recordings to be retrieved or listened to, or only as specifically defined and authorized by a senior manager. f) Assign responsibility for retrieved or listened-to call recordings and permit access only for the reason retrieved. Ensure recordings are securely deleted or destroyed when no longer needed. Note that rendering SAD non-queryable could be assimilated to a compensating control. This would therefore need to be documented as required by PCI DSS.

It is implemented using protocols based on open standards or proprietary protocols. E.1 Protocols, Ports and Network. VoIP is generally implemented using two main protocols: H.323 and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Vendors using “unified communications” can include further protocols due to

securing data by making it unintelligible to a human or computer. Cryptography is only useful when the intended recipient can reassemble the data into a readable form using a method known only to the sender and receiver. See also Encryption. Cyber-Attack Any offensive action to break into a computer or system. Cyber-attacks can range from installing spyware on a PC, breaking into a payment system to steal card data, or attempting to break critical infrastructure such as an electric power grid. Data Breach A data breach is an incident in which sensitive data may have potentially been viewed, stolen, or used by an unauthorized party. Data breaches may involve card data, personal health information (PHI), personally identifiable information (PII), trade secrets, or intellectual property, etc. Default Password A simple password that comes with new software or hardware. Default passwords (like “admin” or “password” or “123456”) are easily guessed and usually are available via online search. They are intended as a placeholder and offer no real security—and must be changed to a stronger password after installing new software or hardware. Data Security Essentials (DSE) Data Security Essentials for Small Merchants is a set of educational resources and an evaluation tool to help merchants simplify their security and reduce risk. DSE is intended as an alternative approach to the PCI DSS Self-Assessment Questionnaires (SAQs) for those merchants designated as eligible by the payment brands and their acquirers (merchant banks). Electronic Cash Register (ECR) A device that registers and calculates transactions and may print out receipts, but does not accept customer card payments. Also called a “till.” Encryption Process of using cryptography to mathematically convert information into a form unusable except to holders of a specific digital key. Use of encryption protects information by devaluing it to criminals. See also Cryptography. Firewall * Hardware and/or software that protects network resources from unauthorized access. A firewall permits or denies communication between computers or networks with different security levels based upon a set of rules and other criteria. 4 Glossary Data Security Essentials for Small Merchants: Glossary of Payment and Information Security Terms | August 2018 Copyright 2018 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved. TERM DEFINITION Forensic Investigator PCI Forensic Investigators (PFIs) are companies approved by the PCI Council to help determine when and how a card data breach occurred. They perform investigations within the financial industry using proven investigative methodologies and tools. They also work with law enforcement to support stakeholders with any resulting criminal investigations. Hacker A person or organization that attempts to circumvent security measures of computer systems to gain control and access. Usually this is done in an effort to steal card data. Hosting Provider * Offers various services to merchants and other service providers, where their customers’ data is “hosted” or resident on the provider’s servers. Typical services include shared space for multiple merchants on a server, providing a dedicated server for one merchant, or web apps such as a website with “shopping cart” options. Integrated Payment Terminal A payment terminal and electronic cash register in one device that takes payments, registers and calculates transactions, and prints receipts. Integrator/Reseller An integrator/reseller is a company that merchants work with to help set up their payment system. This may include installation, configuration, and support. These companies may also sell the payment devices or applications as part of their service. See also Qualified Integrator Reseller (QIR). Log * A file that is created automatically when certain predefined (often security-related) events occur within a computer system or network. Log data includes date/time stamp, description of the event, and information unique to that event. These files are useful for troubleshooting technical issues or a data breach investigation. Also called an “audit log” or “audit trail.” Malware * Malicious software designed to infiltrate a computer system with the intent of stealing data, or damaging applications or the operating system. Such software typically enters a network during many business-approved activities such as via email or browsing websites. Malware examples include viruses, worms, Trojans (or Trojan horses), spyware, adware, and rootkits. Merchant Bank * A bank or financial institution that processes credit and/or debit card payments on behalf of merchants. Also called an “acquirer,” “acquiring bank,” “card processor,” or “payment processor.” See also Payment Processor. Mobile Device Devices such as smart phones and tablets that are small, portable, and can connect to computer networks wirelessly. Mobile Payment Acceptance Using a mobile device to accept and process payment transactions. The mobile device is usually paired with a commercially available card-reader accessory. 5 Glossary Data Security Essentials for Small Merchants: Glossary of Payment and Information Security Terms | August 2018 Copyright 2018 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved. TERM DEFINITION Multi-factor Authentication * Method of authenticating a user when two or more factors are verified. These factors include something the user has (such as a smart card or dongle), something the user knows (such as a password, passphrase, or PIN) or something the user is or does (such as fingerprints, other forms of biometrics, etc.). Network * Two or more computers connected via physical or wireless means. Operating System * Software on a computer system that provides overall management and coordination of computer activities. Examples include Microsoft Windows, Apple OSX, iOS, Android, Linux, and UNIX. P2PE Acronym for the PCI Security Standards Council’s Point-to-Point-Encryption standard.

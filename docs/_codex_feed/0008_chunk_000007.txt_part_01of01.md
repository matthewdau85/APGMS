About these Conditions of Use These Conditions of Use set out the terms under which the ATO: makes its Developer Materials available, and accepts registrations of End User Products from registered Digital Service Providers. These Conditions of Use are governed by, and are to be construed in accordance with, the laws for the time being in force in the Australian Capital Territory. See the Glossary at the end of these Conditions of Use for terms that are defined. See ATO digital wholesale services conditions of use for more information. Conditions of Use may change These Conditions of Use may change, and it is the responsibility of the Digital Service Provider (DSP) to ensure they are compliant with the current Conditions of Use. The Conditions of Use that apply to the developer material provided, your registration as a DSP (as the case may be) or your software product consuming our services, are those that are current as at that time. Developer materials Developer Materials: are only intended to provide guidance to Digital Service Providers in producing and testing their End User Products, do not represent a complete, exhaustive, or exclusive set of tax, superannuation, registry or other interactions, positions, or outcomes, and may change from time to time (including to reflect changes in legislative and administrative requirements). The ATO may provide or otherwise make available Developer Materials to you, but you acknowledge that the ATO is under no obligation to do so. Some materials may be made available from this website , whereas others may not be available to the general public. Certain materials will only be available to Digital Service Providers registered with the ATO. You should: rely on your own skill and judgement when assessing whether and how to use any Developer Material, check to ensure you have the most up to date version of that material, and obtain appropriate professional advice to ensure that material is suited to your particular circumstances. The ATO endeavours to provide accurate and up to date materials for DSPs. If you or your professional advisors believe that any developer materials or test materials are incorrect or produce an incorrect result, you should notify the ATO immediately. Your use of developer materials Unless the ATO provides Developer Material with another licensing arrangement and/or additional restrictions, the licence set out on the Copyright page will apply to your use of that material. However, your use of Developer Material is at your own risk. All Developer Material is provided by the ATO "as is" and without charge – the ATO: does not guarantee that Developer Material is available nor, when available, that it is complete, up to date and accurate, assumes no responsibility for the unavailability of, or for any errors, faults, or omissions in, Developer Material, gives no express or implied warranties (and to the full extent permitted by law excludes all statutory warranties) in relation to that Developer Material (including as to its performance or fitness for a particular purpose), and will not be liable in any way for any loss or damage (including special, indirect, or consequential) arising in any way from or in connection with that Developer Material or its use, performance, or unavailability, even if the ATO has been advised of their possibility. End user product registration So that an End User Product may be used (by its end users) to interact with ATO information systems in a given way that End User Product must be registered and have met the requirements for use by the ATO, for interactions of that class or type. To have your End User Product registered in relation to a class or type of interaction with ATO information systems, you must: be registered as a Digital Service Provider, ensure that your End User Product meets all functional and security requirements described in the Developer Materials relevant to that class or type of interaction, successfully test your End User Product against the Test Materials relevant to that class or type of interaction, provide a declaration to (and in the form reasonably required by) the ATO certifying that your End User Product meets all those functional requirements, and has been tested against and produced the same results as those Test Materials, and provide the information relating to your End User Product the ATO reasonably requires. You can make and submit an application for registration of your End User Product on the Product Registration page. Submitting an application does not give an entitlement to be registered. Continuing responsibilities for your End User Products Digital Service Providers are responsible for: Ensuring end users are aware of and accept the End User Agreement keeping abreast of any changes to, and in compliance with any legislative or administrative requirements, advising the ATO immediately of any changes to your business or product environment. The ATO is not, under any circumstances, responsible for ensuring that your End User Product complies with any laws or administrative requirements applicable in Australia or elsewhere. Listing on the Product Register If the ATO approves for use and registers your End User Product in relation to a class or type of interaction with ATO information systems, then the ATO will list (where required) your End User Product on the Product Register . If you provide a description of your End User Product for inclusion in that listing, it is your responsibility to ensure that description accurately reflects your product. Complaints about

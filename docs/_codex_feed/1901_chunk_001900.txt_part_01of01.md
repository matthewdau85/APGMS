When you send money, or receive it, it's good to know what it's for. If Osko is enabled on both sending and receiving accounts, you can use up to 280 characters to describe it. And you don't even have to stick with words either. If you're a business, you can ask customers to include the important stuff such as an invoice number in the 'Reference' field, making it easy for you to keep track of the money coming your way!

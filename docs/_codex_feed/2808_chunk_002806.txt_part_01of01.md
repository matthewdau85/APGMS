Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 5.3.5 Loss of Compliance Status Loss of a TPSP’s PCI DSS compliance status can have significant ramifications for an entity relying on the TPSP’s services. Accordingly, entities may wish to consider mechanisms intended to keep the entity apprised of changes in PCI DSS compliance status, and to appropriately allocate responsibility for loss of compliance status among the parties. Such mechanisms may include:  Disclosure/notice of changes in compliance status to the impacted entity  Remediation plans and procedures to re-establish compliance by set dates  Regular status meetings to advise on remediation efforts  Other appropriate measures intended to help ensure accountability and responsibility for non- compliance The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 27 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 6 Maintaining Relationships with and Monitoring Third-Party Service Providers Establishing and maintaining a program to monitor TPSP compliance with PCI DSS Requirement 12.8.412 is a critical requirement for any entity. A monitoring program will allow an entity to monitor the compliance status of TPSP(s) and determine whether a change in status requires a change in the relationship. Validation of compliance takes place at a single point in time, and unfortunately it is quite easy for an entity to allow processes to relax and for compliance to lapse. Relying on other parties for services—including outsourcing critical functions—does not relieve an entity of responsibility for the security of its cardholder data, and TPSP compliance must be monitored continuously and diligently. Investing the time and effort to develop and implement a strong TPSP monitoring program provides numerous benefits to the entity. First, and most importantly, the monitoring program will improve the entity’s security posture and help ensure the protection of cardholder data for which the organization is responsible by providing assurance and awareness about whether the TPSP continues to share the same level of commitment in handling CHD. A monitoring program will also ensure there is regular communication between the TPSP and the entity regarding changes to the environment including processes and procedures. This allows the entity to be in a proactive—instead of reactive—position. Second, the monitoring program will provide a consistent process to simplify the ongoing monitoring and management of TPSPs. Finally, the monitoring program will enable an entity to demonstrate compliance with a key section of the PCI DSS, should proof be requested from a party performing an assessment. As part of an entity’s monitoring program, an onboarding process for new TPSPs should be developed and maintained, including providing new TPSPs with information attained through the various stages of engagement (i.e., risk analysis, contract details, responsibility matrix, etc.) This additional information should be incorporated into the monitoring program to create the framework for monitoring a TPSP. 6.1 Developing a Third-party Service Provider Monitoring Program A TPSP monitoring program should be fully documented. This ensures there is a common understanding of its elements across the organization, facilitates delegating portions of the process if required, and allows review of the process by outside parties when necessary. The elements of the program should include processes, policies, and procedures, and assignment of responsibility for those elements to specific people within the organization. The program documentation should be revisited on a regular basis in order to make corrections and improvements as the business processes and TPSP relationships evolve. It is recommended that program documentation be reviewed at least on an annual basis and is approved by management. The program documentation should cover the following areas, including guidance on the intent and importance: 12 This reference is to PCI DSS v3.1 – April 2015 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 28 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 6.1.1 Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) Scope Definition Ensuring the CDE scope is correctly defined and verified is pivotal in determining the level of effort required to achieve compliance. The entity needs to ensure that all resources involved in the monitoring of TPSPs understand the concept of CDE scope, and specify what is needed in order to fully define scope (e.g., a high-level network diagram with applications and network components clearly labeled, out- of-scope validation activities, etc.). Once scope has been confirmed, the program should include a deliverable that explains the CDE scope and indicates the role of each TPSP and how it impacts the entity’s PCI DSS scope. 6.1.2 Maintaining an Inventory of Third-Party Service Providers Define the procedures to maintain an inventory of all TPSPs, including the information elements deemed critical. The following are suggested elements that may be included in the inventory:  Name and primary points of contact at the TPSP  Specific service(s) being provided  If cardholder data is shared, what elements are shared (sensitive authentication data, PAN, expiry, etc.)  Location of the data—is the data stored internally in the organization, by the third party in one of its locations, or by an external hosting provider  What system components are included in the review  TPSP risk-assessment results  Frequency of monitoring cycle  Last date of review  Contract renewal/expiry  Documentation/evidence required  Any nested TPSPs leveraged to provide the services  Any third-party payment applications used to provide the services  Volume of cardholder

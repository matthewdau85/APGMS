For example, having numerous audits and assessments can introduce staggered or overlapping timeframes for each assessment along with potentially unique assessment processes for each assessment type. Conducting multiple different audit processes may require evidence to be provided from a common set of assets, which risks that the requested evidence may not be consistent and results in a potentially considerable amount of duplicated effort. 7.1 Compliance Cycles and Assessments Managing and coordinating PCI DSS assessments can be demanding in large organizations with multiple service providers who work with different business units. Business units and service providers that do not comply with required controls, or for whom significant issues are identified during a risk assessment or due diligence process, can delay the organization's certification process, particularly when the organization is heavily reliant on a given service provider for critical business processes. Typical challenges encountered are:  Handling of cardholder data has not obtained the necessary PCI DSS validation for the services provided.  Risk assessment of business units and service providers that have a trusted level of access to the cardholder data environment identifies one or more significant issues.  Business units and service providers who cannot (or will not) resolve the relevant matters in a timely fashion can adversely affect the compliance timeline of the organization.  Tracking all card-acceptance methods and the controls required for each type.  Combining multiple SAQ types within areas of the organization and the associated control requirements.  Preparing for an audit, knowing the process, and understanding the data sets required. The following steps can help manage and coordinate PCI DSS assessments:  Identify all applicable legal and regulatory requirements for the environment and: – Develop a security profile using the most stringent requirements. Using a multi-regulation mapping spreadsheet is beneficial during this exercise. Systems are introduced to the environment as per the developed configurations standards. – Identify the evidence requirements to satisfy the unique audits and record the expiration dates for each where applicable. – Coordinate unique audit schedules, so that the sampled evidence can be used within the acceptable timeframes for all reviews.  Distribute a vendor-risk profile and information-gathering questionnaire to all business units that may engage with vendor procurement directly. The series of questions will help determine when a PCI DSS scope review is needed. This process is tied to change control, vendor-risk assurance, and risk- treatment processes.

Adopt a corporate-wide governance process that includes the early involvement of the cybersecurity/compliance team.  Use an SAQ-D to capture the status of overlapping SAQs. Each requirement that is N/A will need supporting rationale.  Review and validate PCI DSS documentation throughout the year. Documentation includes: – Cardholder data flows – Network diagrams – Asset lists – Policies – Procedures – Configuration standards – Security operations tracking Include documentation updates as a trailing requirement to change control. Assign the documentation review and verification to the compliance team before a change control item is fully closed.

While some functional groups, such as Information Technologies, Information Security and Compliance, might be aware of PCI DSS requirements, security responsibilities extend beyond these groups and include all those who can impact cardholder data. Many stakeholders outside IT organizations are not historically focused on security and compliance, and have difficulty understanding and retaining the PCI DSS knowledge relevant for their role. Additional considerations for providing PCI DSS awareness and education training in global organizations include managing translations of training content into multiple local languages and tracking regional training effectiveness. Local laws and customs may make it hard, if not impossible, to track employee performance of training due to privacy restrictions and how training material has been communicated. This can lead to situations where proof of training varies between countries due to the lack of centralized record management. Organizations with diverse functions and staff skill levels across its staff may need to create multiple versions of its PCI DSS training that are tailored to each skill level and function. The day-to-day activities of customer- facing staff, such as cashiers, is very different from that of a database administrator or security operations staff. Defining the roles and PCI DSS knowledge required are critical first steps. Training for customer-facing staff should be developed with a focus on the impact of

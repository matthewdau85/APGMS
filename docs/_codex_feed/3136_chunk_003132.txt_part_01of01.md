PATCHING BEST PRACTICES RESOURCES Often, software has ﬂaws or mistakes made by programmers when they wrote the code. Vendors regularly issue updates known as patches to ﬁx these software vulnerabilities. When businesses don’t apply software patches from vendors hackers exploit these vulnerabilities to break into their computers and systems and steal payment data. 80% of hacking attacks could be prevented by strengthening passwords and installing software patches Timely installation of security patches is crucial to minimize the risk of being breached. In order to apply patches quickly, it is important that you know how your software is being regularly updated with patches and who is responsible (it could be you!). Install patches Follow your vendors’ instructions and install patches as soon as possible. Vulnerability scanning tools provided by PCI Approved Scanning Vendors can also help businesses automatically search your networks to ﬁnd vulnerabilities and report when patches need to be applied.

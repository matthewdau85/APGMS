Martin, Nedim Goren, and Charif Mahmoudi, Fog Computing Conceptual Manual, NIST Special Publication 500-325, (Gaithersburg: National Institute of Standards and Technology, March 2018). https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.500-325. 21 Open Fog Consortium, https://www.openfogconsortium.org. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 62 Traditional Defined Network Software Defined Network Figure E-1: Comparison of SDN and traditional networking SDN environments should be evaluated in a consistent manner whether they are provided by an external Provider (in a public or hybrid cloud scenario) or an internal Provider (in an on-premises private cloud scenario). The SDN Provider must maintain a separation of duties from the SDN consumer (whether an external Customer or a business unit within an organization), even if they are in the same organization, to ensure that the SDN Provider is not able to alter the network topology or rules outside what is agreed upon with the Customer. In multi-tenancy SDN environments, SDN consumers should be logically separated from each other within the SDN, and each SDN consumer should only be able to update the network policies applicable to its systems, and should not have visibility to the policies managed by other SDN consumers.

When using SDN, it is necessary to ensure that the intent of all requirements is fulfilled by either the SDN Provider or the SDN Customer; for example IDS/IPS functions, obfuscation of Internal IP addresses, hardening of the SDN infrastructure, time-synchronization, securing of centralized audit trail and periodic log review. E.5 Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)/Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) As the Customer's access to network level data can be severely restricted in cloud environments, the responsibility for tracking intrusions at the network layer will often reside with the Provider, as the only entity that has sufficient privileges to do this across the underlying infrastructure. Depending on the type of service layer (i.e., IaaS, PaaS or SaaS), Providers may be able to offer access to the intrusion detection system (IDS) or intrusion prevention system (IPS), or the data from the tools they use, to allow cloud service Customers to have auditing and alerting capabilities: ▪ SaaS: Since Customer access to low level network traffic is impossible, it must rely on Providers for IDS/IPS, monitoring and alerting. ▪ PaaS: Customers have no direct access to IDS/IPS functionality, as they are typically outside the platform, and therefore must rely on Providers for IDS/IPS. ▪ IaaS: Customer and Providers have shared responsibilities and should evaluate deploying IDS/IPS in key locations in the IaaS environmentfor example, within virtual machines or containers, hypervisor/host systems, virtual network or underlying network infrastructure. Other alternatives to implement intrusion detection or intrusion prevention in the cloud environments include locking traffic to specific defined resources based on role rather than IP (dynamic changes in the cloud make locking to IPs problematic: the range is either too big or too small), using a host- based IPS/IDS solution on the instance image or container, or routing network traffic through a third- party IPS/IDS service provider (i.e., a SECaaS service provider). These and other alternatives should be evaluated by the Provider, Customer and the assessor involved in compliance validation to ensure that they meet the intent of all applicable requirements of PCI DSS.

Hypervisor configuration and access are particularly important, as a hypervisor provides a single point of entry to all its VMs and can potentially be used to gain access to sensitive data and resources on separate VMs. An additional consideration is the degree to which the hypervisor is used to deliver security functionality to the VMs. For example, a simple, hardened hypervisor may be very secure but offer limited security capabilities, whereas a more complex, security-capable hypervisor with improved functionality could potentially present a greater risk if compromised.22 Functionality that allows the hypervisor to control and monitor individual VM activity from outside the VMs is known as introspection. Hypervisor introspection expands the functionality of the hypervisor to allow a deeper analysis of the

A.4 Fees QSA agrees to pay all applicable fees imposed by PCI SSC in connection with QSA’s and its Assessor-Employees’ participation in each PCI SSC Program in which QSA is a participant (collectively, "Fees"), in each case as and in the manner provided for in the applicable Program Qualification Requirements, the PCI SSC Programs Fee Schedule on the Website and/or the other applicable PCI SSC Program documentation. Such Fees may include, without limitation, initial processing fees, regional qualification fees, regional re-qualification fees, training fees, fees in connection with quality assurance and/or remediation, fees to cover administrative costs, re- listing, penalties and other costs, and other fees. QSA agrees to pay all such Fees as and when required by PCI SSC and that all Fees are nonrefundable (regardless of whether QSA's application is approved, QSA has been removed from the QSA List, this Agreement or any Addendum hereto has been terminated, or otherwise). QSA acknowledges that PCI SSC may review and modify its Fees at any time and from time to time. Whenever a change in Fees occurs, PCI SSC shall notify QSA in accordance with the terms of Section A.10.1. Such change(s) will be effective immediately after the date of such notification. However, should QSA not agree with such change(s), QSA shall have the right to terminate this Agreement (or, if such change only applies to a Related PCI SSC Program, the corresponding Addendum (defined in Section A.9.2 below) for such Related PCI SSC Program) upon written notice to PCI SSC in accordance with the provisions of Section A.10.1 at any time within 30 days after such notification from PCI SSC. Except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in the QSA Qualification Requirements or other applicable PCI SSC Program documentation, all fees payable to PCI SSC in connection with any PCI SSC Program must be paid in US dollars (USD), by check, by credit card or by wire transfer to a PCI SSC bank account specified for such purpose by PCI SSC. QSA acknowledges and agrees that such Fees do not include any taxes, such as value added taxes (VAT), sales, excise, gross receipts and withholding taxes, universal service fund fee, or any similar tax or other government imposed fees or surcharges which may be applicable thereto. QSA shall pay all such taxes and fees as invoiced in accordance with local law, and agrees to pay or reimburse PCI SSC for all such taxes or fees, excluding tax on PCI SSC's income. In respect of withholding tax, QSA will pay such additional amounts as may be necessary, such that PCI SSC receives the amount it would have received had no withholding been imposed.

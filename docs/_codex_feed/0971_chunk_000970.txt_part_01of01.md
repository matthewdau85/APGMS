getting us to a point where folks are getting on board with phishing-resistant authentication. They're starting to leverage it. They understand the benefits. So, I think we're on a really great path and I really applaud these organizations, like PCI, for really stepping forward to show the difference and educate on that. But, I think what we need to do after that is, and it's going to take some time, but we have to then start removing some of the phishable authentication methods that folks are using. So increase the use of passkeys, start removing passwords and other types of phishable authentication methods from being like the backup for criminals to go after, right? Once we can get rid of that, we're going to be at a place where we're going to be in a lot better of a spot, but we're certainly on a great path forward. Alicia Malone: Andrew? Andrew Jamieson: Yeah, so I think it's an interesting and exciting time that we're living in at the moment because we spent so long up until this point relying on and using knowledge-based factors for authentication and not just in the computer era. You know, if we go back further than that, the secret passphrases and, you know, knocks on the door and things like this, they were all used as forms of authentication because that's essentially all we had. If you weren't talking to somebody directly, if you're doing something where you didn't know the person, a knowledge-based factor is pretty much the only thing that you had. We're heading into a point where we're able to leverage the ability of the computing systems that we are using to be better at these things than we are, better at computation, better at storing more complex information, to use not just knowledge-based factors, but calculation-based factors, if you like, position-based factors based on cryptography, to move away from these knowledge-based systems. And I think that's exciting. I mean, not everybody's going think that's exciting, but I think that's quite exciting. It's not going to solve everything, though. When we think about authenticating into a system, there's kind of three stages to it. There's the enrollment stage where you initially confirm that you are the right person to have that access. There's the actual validation-of-who-you-are stage, and that's where passkeys come in. But, then, there's the ongoing access stage as well. Once you've authenticated, you're not authenticating every packet that you send to that system, you're generally given some sort of token or given some sort of connection that you use over a session or some extended period of time. So, passkeys and phishing-resistant authentication solves that kind of middle point where we are concerned about the theft of passwords being used, knowledge-based factors, computers just being better at it than we are. But I think what we need to do as we move into the future, to make sure that we are in a perfect future where account takeover is no longer a threat, we also need to solve the kind of the initial enrollment phase, and we need to look at the ongoing authentication phases as well. But, the good news is we've got technology in the pipeline that's going to help with those systems as well. So, how close are we? We're a lot closer, but, as always, there's still work to be done. Alicia Malone: Well, thank you both because you both offered a very interesting perspective. Is there anything else that you would like to add, in regard to using passkeys versus passwords? Megan Shamas: I would just say I would love to have passwords not be a thing in my lifetime. That would be a wonderful thing to see. Andrew Jamieson: I would reiterate that I think phishing-resistant authentication is a great technology. It is something that can solve a lot of the issues that we have with passwords. And I would strongly suggest when people looking at what technologies they're going to implement for authentication, they have a look at phishing-resistant authentication and what it can bring, but also understanding that it is a little bit different to what people are used to and looking into how they can integrate that correctly and securely into their overall authentication architecture. Megan Shamas: Thank you. If I could add on to that, that's a really great point that I also would encourage more folks within organizations or guidance-setters or policy-setters to heed what Andrew just said, and really look at and try to understand how this is fundamentally different than what we're used to, and ensure that it's being acknowledged in policies being set or requirements being set. It is fundamentally just different than what we're used to with passwords plus factor, factor, factor, and we have evolved the technology and now folks need to also evolve their requirements and their policies along with that. And that will really help organizations get on the right path to getting rid of phishable authentication. So again, I want to thank PCI for its recognition of phishing-resistant authentication, as well as NIST and other global organizations, who are really seeing that this is something they need to communicate to the folks that heed their requirements. So thank you and thank you for having me. Alicia Malone: Well, thank you both so much for joining us on Coffee with the Council

Welcome to the PCI Security Standards Council’s blog series, The AI Exchange: Innovators in Payment Security. This special, ongoing feature of our PCI Perspectives blog offers a resource for payment security industry stakeholders to exchange information about how they are adopting and implementing artificial intelligence (AI) into their organizations. In this edition of The AI Exchange, Elavon Inc. Director of Customer Data Security, Candice Pressinger, offers insight into how her company is using AI, and how this rapidly growing technology is shaping the future of payment security. How have you most recently incorporated artificial intelligence within your organization? At Elavon, AI now underpins our fraud orchestration layer. We have deployed adaptive scoring and dynamic rule applications across our merchant portfolio, enabling real-time decisioning based on thousands of contextual signals per transaction. Using this AI driven capability, Elavon has also increased exemption-based authorization approvals by 3.6 percentage points in the European market. One of the other main benefits so far is enabling engineers to complete their code through AI assistance using GitHub co-pilot. SVP Elavon’s Software Engineering Director, Richie Walsh, is working towards AI Agents being able to work from user-story through to deploying to production and monitoring production applications. We will be enabling our Platform Engineering/DevOps with new tools to automate code generation quality gates, deployment and monitoring. Finally, for AI we plan to use it to help with the generation of API integrations for our merchants and partners through our developer portal. What is the most significant change you’ve seen in your organization since AI-use has become so much more prevalent? AI has redefined how we approach both risk and optimization internally and for our merchants. What was once a linear fraud flow is now a dynamic orchestration model, layered with real-time machine learning insights. In our latest regional pilot, AI-driven decisioning improved exemption accuracy by 29% and contributed to a 9% reduction in customer friction at checkout. From a purely operational perspective, one of the biggest changes is that people look at some of the tedious everyday work in a different light. AI allows the opportunities and drive to do something about these challenges. While (Gen) AI might not always be the answer, there is a new openness and excitement to a different approach. How do you see AI evolving or impacting payment security in the future? We’ve spent years trying to stop fraud. And it’s worked, sort of. But it’s not going to be enough. In payments, the real opportunity now is not just protection, it’s precision. Enabling trust at scale, in real time, without breaking the customer journey. That’s what AI unlocks when it’s done right. We’re moving from old-school rules and reactive defense to something smarter: AI that predicts risk before it happens, adapts dynamically, and learns with every transaction. This is especially powerful for SMBs, who’ve long been priced out of enterprise-grade fraud tools. With the right AI, they get more than security; they get optimization. More than 50% of declined transactions are false positives and is a $600 billion industry problem as merchants who are tightening security to block fraud. That’s not just friction that’s lost revenue. At Elavon, our early-stage AI models have already cut false positives by up to 65%. Merchants keep the right customers, protect conversion, and reduce chargebacks without introducing friction. No more trade-offs. There is also the problem with the bots. Fraudsters are using automation to overwhelm checkout flows. But we’re not defenseless. Tools like Spec use AI honey traps, behavioral biometrics, and intent analytics to catch bots before they can act. These systems spot the difference between a human and a script not by what they do, but how they do it. Spec’s approach has shown up to 99% reduction in bot-driven attacks. And that matters because fraudsters don’t wait. Neither should we. AI is no longer just fraud prevention. It’s fraud orchestration. It blends context, behavior, and business logic to make smarter decisions in milliseconds. For the industry, it’s a wake-up call. Security should never come at the cost of conversion and with the right AI, it doesn’t have to. What potential risks should organizations consider as AI becomes more integrated into payment security? With every leap forward in AI, we gain not just power, but responsibility. As AI becomes deeply embedded in payment security, it’s tempting to chase speed, scale, and optimization wins. But true resilience lies in recognizing and actively managing the risks that grow with scale. The greatest threat isn’t always malicious. More often, it’s systemic. Unchecked, AI can introduce blind spots like misclassifying transactions, skewing risk scores, or failing to keep pace with evolving fraud tactics. And in a world where milliseconds make the difference between catching fraud and killing a legitimate sale (those false positives mentioned earlier), those blind spots matter. According to the World Economic Forum and McKinsey, 51% of organizations have already experienced an AI-related failure, yet only 1 in 5 have implemented the governance needed to prevent recurrence. A recent IBM report found 75% of CEOs say they cannot trust AI without proper oversight, and only 39% report having governance in place for generative AI today. The message is clear here that trust doesn’t just happen. It is built. At Elavon, we don’t just run models, we build them and have stringent model risk governance in place. Our fraud-specific AI is developed and maintained by dedicated data science teams, tuned

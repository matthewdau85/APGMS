and Physical protection of the equipment. (e.g., bonded carrier, device authentication code injected by Terminal vendor and verified on receipt, tamper evident packaging, etc.). The device is delivered with secret information to allow the KIF to ascertain that the device is genuine and not compromised providing the secret information has not been erased. 37 B.2.8 The key generation device will not output any plaintext key except under dual control. Such dual control shall be enforced by the KGD/KID or the PED requiring that at least two passwords be correctly entered within a period of no more than five minutes, before the device will output/accept a key. The device shall ensure that passwords are at least 5 characters long and the characters shall be a mixture of alphanumeric where available. 12 B.2.9 Where an asymmetric key pair is generated for transfer into another device by a KGD/KID that will not use the key pair, then the private key of the key pair and all related secret seed elements shall be ‘zeroised’ or otherwise permanently deleted immediately after the transfer to the target device has been ensured. 14 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 33 KIF Requirements Ref B.2.10 The transfer mechanisms by which plaintext keys, key components or passwords are transferred into or out of the KGD/KID are protected and/or inspected so as to prevent any type of monitoring that could result in the unauthorized disclosure of any keys, key components or passwords. This shall take into account all aspects of monitoring, including the use of surveillance cameras. This will require all cables and attachments to be managed under dual control. 30 B.2.11 All plain text keys that have been injected into a device are to be maintained in one of the acceptable key forms as stated in this document. These keys shall not be retained by the KIF after the keys have been injected and are in the possession of the sponsor of the device. 28 B.2.12 Controls are in place to ensure that no information remains within any KGD/KID that is to be removed from the KIF which could disclose any cryptographic key that ever existed within that device. 29 B.2.13 Controls are in place to detect the unauthorized reinstallation of a KGD/KID previously removed from a facility. 31 B.2.14 Controls are in place to detect the unauthorized removal of the KGD/KID from, and its unauthorized replacement back into, its authorized location. 32 B.2.15 All keys that have been used, or potentially could be used, in a KGD/KID that has been removed from service shall be destroyed. If this cannot be accomplished then the device shall be physically destroyed so that no keys can be disclosed nor the device placed back in service again. This requirement does not include keys that have been already deployed in the field. 86 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 34 KIF Requirements Ref B.2.16 Controls are in place to detect the unauthorized removal of the KGD/KID from, and its unauthorized replacement back into, its authorized location. This could take the form of: mechanisms such that the removal of that device from its operational location will cause the automatic erasure of the cryptographic keys contained within that device; the KGD/KID is stored, under dual control, in a safe or room that cannot feasibly be penetrated, and each incident of opening or closing the safe or room is recorded under dual control. 16 B.2.17 Unauthorized use of the KGD/KID, when in active use, is prevented or detected by means such as the following: the KGD/KID has functional or physical characteristics (e.g., passwords or physical high-security keys) that prevent use of that device except under dual control, and when in that useable state, that device is under the continuous supervision of at least two trusted people who are qualified to detect and able to observe any attempted unauthorized access, and able also to prevent such access before it is successful; the KGD/KID is at all times either locked or sealed in a tamper- evident cabinet or else is under the continuous supervision of at least two authorized people who ensure that any unauthorized use of that device would be detected. 17 & 19 B.2.18 When the KGD/KID is not in active use, any unauthorized access to that device is prevented by means such as the following: the facility (e.g., room) where the KGD/KID operates has sufficient supervision and controls to prevent any unauthorized access to that device that would allow alteration to that device or disclosure of any key or other sensitive data without detection; the KGD/KID is stored, under dual control, in a safe that cannot feasibly be penetrated without detection, and each incident of opening or closing the safe is recorded under dual control. 18 & 20 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 35 KIF Requirements Ref B.2.19 Any physical keys used to secure, unlock or operate a KGD/KID are carefully controlled, and available only to authorized persons. 22 B.2.20 The KID is used to inject a plaintext key into a cryptographic device only under the direct supervision of at least two authorized people, both of whom ensure

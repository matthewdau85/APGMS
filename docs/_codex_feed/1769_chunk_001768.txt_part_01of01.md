AP+ convened a Payment Service Provider (PSP) Forum in August, with strong participation from across the ecosystem. The discussion focused on AP+’s strategic priorities, progress on major initiatives, and opportunities to bring PSPs' perspective earlier into the product development cycle. The session opened with an update on AP+’s three strategic pillars - ecosystem sustainability, building trust in the digital economy, and enabling innovation. Attendees heard how work is progressing on the modernisation of payments and the move to NPP, keeping eftpos competitive in mobile wallets, and continuing to simplify infrastructure while supporting new account-to-account payment use cases. Product updates highlighted both momentum and areas for further input. Confirmation of Payee has seen a strong start since launch, and participants discussed how the service could extend to payroll, e-invoicing and business account validation, while balancing privacy and liability considerations. Merchant tokenisation is progressing, with PSPs noting the need for issuer readiness to avoid fragmented rollouts. The use of PayID as a receivables solution was recognised as an attractive opportunity for B2B and C2B payments and PSP’s feedback was captured. Feedback on the forum was positive, with participants valuing the open, interactive format and the opportunity to engage earlier in product ideation. Ideas for the future included holding such forums more often, providing better introductions for all attendees including virtual, and ensuring discussions are timely and informed by a wider range of perspectives. Based on the feedback received, AP+ will adopt the more interactive format for the PSP Forum going forward. Our thanks go to our in-person and remote attendees for their participation, with AP+ staff joined by representatives from Advam, Azupay, Ezypay, FusionPay, GoCardless, Gr4vy, IPSI, Merchant Warrior, Monoova, Ozedi, Paydock, Qwikpay, ShaBaas Pay, Shift Financial, Stripe and TNS.

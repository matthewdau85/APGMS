Australia has implemented the (GloBE Rules) by introducing a global and domestic minimum tax. The GloBE Rules provide for a coordinated system of taxation intended to ensure multinational enterprise groups (MNE groups) are subject to a global minimum tax rate of 15% in each of the jurisdictions where they operate. On 10 December 2024, primary legislation to implement the framework of the GloBE Rules in Australia received royal assent. The primary legislation also makes consequential amendments, which are necessary for the administration of top-up tax within the existing tax administration framework, consistent with the GloBE Rules. On 23 December 2024, subordinate legislation was registered as a legislative instrument. This means the subordinate legislation is now in force, noting it is subject to the standard parliamentary process for legislative instruments, including a disallowance period. With the implementation of this measure, in-scope multinational groups will need to: provide new information to adhere to the reporting obligations under the global minimum tax and domestic minimum tax (this may require new systems) lodge a GloBE Information Return (GIR) the GIR will need to be lodged 18 months after the first year end (15 months for subsequent years) the OECD have published the GIR, for details download GloBE Information Return (PDF, 1.3MB) . To deliver on the intent of the OECD GloBE rules and a domestic minimum tax, of interest to this group, the following key elements need to be delivered: New electronic approved forms complying with the OECD’s specified XML schema and new Australian tax returns complying with domestic requirements for an approved form to enable assessment and collection of Top-up Tax. Lodgment and compliance processes designed to be in pattern with existing systems. An international data exchange component to share relevant information with implementing tax administrations. IT systems to capture and store lodged and exchanged data for reporting and administration purposes. New data and analytics capabilities to process and analyse stored information, as well as exchange capabilities where required.

for matching the RACI functions for each task. RACI documents are useful in clarifying and defining roles and responsibilities in cross-functional processes and multiple business units. There are several alternative methods and expanded RACI versions for mapping responsibilities. The version that is most applicable depends on the requirements of the organization. By involving business units directly with the development of RACI documents, the business units can gain a greater appreciation of the compliance efforts across the organization. If processes change, the business units can identify and assist with resolving potential issues at an early stage. Increased and widespread awareness about PCI DSS security controls is crucial to ensure that compliance is maintained, and that the likelihood of PCI DSS requirement gaps and data mishandling are mitigated. Figure 1. Determining Ownership for a RACI document 4.3 Responsibilities in Planning PCI DSS Assessments Understanding roles and responsibilities within large organizations is an important step for planning assessments and gathering evidence. Prior to starting the formal PCI DSS assessment activities, organizations should explain to assessors the nature and structure of the organization, the services offered, the payment channels accepted, and the scope for the upcoming assessment. Additionally, the entity should provide the assessor with all appropriate documentation in advance to help with planning the assessment. For example: Information Supplement • PCI DSS for Large Organizations • February 2020 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard or constitute legal advice. 12  Documentation to help the assessor understand the IT infrastructure  The technologies in use  Cardholder data flows  The number of devices that make up the cardholder data environment Organizations and assessors should work together to develop an assessment plan. The plan should cover the people, processes, and technologies that are in scope for the assessment. This can help identify evidence to be gathered, and assist with scheduling onsite visits and interviews with relevant personnel. Scheduling interviews as far in advance as possible can help the assessor optimize time spent with knowledge holders and retrieve the necessary information during the initial meeting to complete the assessment more efficiently. Although the plan can be proposed by either the organization or the assessor, it is beneficial for both parties to be involved. In a large organization where the knowledge of the systems is spread across multiple individuals, teams, organizations, business units, countries, or regions, having a central point of contact to coordinate input from across the organization can be beneficial.

In many cases, large organizations often are created through mergers and acquisitions, which generally result in the consolidation of assets and liabilities. The change in legal relationships between business units being merged or acquired can add a layer of complexity. Mergers and acquisitions can also have a significant impact on PCI DSS scope and compliance obligations. 5.1 Pre-purchase and Due Diligence Typically, mergers and acquisitions require considerable due diligence and pre-purchase investigations by the buyer or parties involved, so that the organizations involved know what they are purchasing and the obligations they are assuming. These investigations should result in an understanding of the organization’s:  Payment channels  Technologies  Service providers  Assignment of responsibilities  Compliance obligations  Existing contracts - client agreements, supplier contracts  PCI DSS controls Due diligence activities should consider the impact that the merger or acquisition is having on the target organization. In an organization that is facing financial pressures and susceptible to being purchased or sold, existing PCI DSS security controls may be at risk. For example, an organization focused on cost reduction and profit declaration may not deploy or suitably maintain the controls required to secure cardholder data. Determining the potential impact on PCI DSS compliance activities early in the process can help entities ensure that cardholder data remains protected. Another factor to consider is that business units within a large organization might operate with a high degree of autonomy. In these situations, decisions made about payment card acceptance arrangements by regional management at a local level may not get communicated throughout the organization. Due diligence activities should therefore include consideration for all distributed and regional business units. Obtaining the most recent Report(s) on Compliance (ROC) and Attestation of Compliance (AOC) for business units being acquired is critical in determining the security state of the payment channels for these business units. As merger and acquisition timelines may extend over multiple PCI DSS assessment periods, an organization should ensure it has the most recent reports and AOCs as soon as they are available. 5.2 Existing Compliance and Integration To prioritize controls, it is important to determine whether an organization was compliant from the start or met PCI DSS compliance controls at one time and then failed to maintain those controls. Some organizations may not be evidentially compliant with PCI DSS, and their compliance state is not actively being pursued by the acquirer or its agent. A lack of knowledge of PCI DSS can cause an organization to misrepresent its

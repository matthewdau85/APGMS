capture an image of each document. The specifics of the sorting process are under the control of its operating software. Reject(s): A term used for a rejected document(s). The document may be rejected visually as not meeting AusPayNet criteria, or by not being readable on a reader/sorter. Most commonly this term applies to reader/sorter non-acceptance. Saturation (Magnetic): The condition in which the flux density of the printing can no longer be increased by increasing the applied magnetisation in a plane parallel to the paper. Secondary reference document: Paper documents specially printed in magnetic ink with characters of the E-13B font. These documents are of known relative signal level and are for use in calibration of equipment used to measure relative signal level. Signal strength: The amplitude of the designated peak(s) in the voltage waveform of a MICR character when measured on an appropriate and properly calibrated MICR tester. Skew: The tilt or angle of a MICR character relative to the aligning edge of the document. The skew of the entire MICR line refers to the average tilt or angle of the line relative to the aligning edge of the document. Stroke: The horizontal or vertical lines of a printed MICR character. Stroke width: The measurable width of a printed stroke or line. The edges of the stroke can be irregular depending on printing methods, paper surface or both. The stroke width is thus measured as the average distance between the average edges of a stroke. Symbol: A sign or emblem used instead of words for identification or representation. Toner: The black powder used in non-impact printing technologies to form the printed image. Trailing edge: The left edge of the document when its face is viewed. Transaction Code field: This is a three-digit field, used by Financial Institutions to classify transaction types. It is sometimes referred to as the “ Trancode Field”. Variable format field: A description or specification of information content that will vary according to the needs of a user. Void: The absence of ink within the specified outline of the printed MICR character. Waveform: A voltage representation of signals with respect to time that corresponds to a MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 12 AusPayNet September 2017 particular character or symbol. Waveform reader (single slot reader): A MICR reader that uses a permanent magnet write head and a single slot magnetic read head, usually 5/8 inch high, in order to pass over the entire MICR clear band. Each MICR character in the clear band generates a unique voltage waveform consisting of accurately spaced positive and negative peaks. From the peak amplitude and position data, individual MICR characters are identified. 1.3 References Specifications for Placement and Location of MICR Printing, ANSI X9.13-1990 Quality Control of MICR Documents, X9/TG-6-1995, ASC X9 Technical Guideline Print and Test Specifications for Magnetic Ink Printing (MICR), ANSI X9.27 –1998 Standard 3, Automated Processing of Vouchers, May 1997, Association for Payment Clearing Services, UK Electronic MICR Printing and Check Processing, G.

General Specifications 2.1 Character Specifications 2.1.1 Character Set The E-13B character set comprises 10 numerals and 4 special symbols. The ten numerals are: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 The four special symbols are: Amount < Domestic = BSB ; Dash > 2.1.2 Dimensions The character set is designed using a grid of 0.013 inch squares with rounded corners normally of a radius 0.0065 inch, with the exception of the number zero, and the curve blends with adjacent edges. In the case of zero the inner radius is 0.013 inch and the outer radius is 0.0260 inch. The design matrix is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 2 MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 15 AusPayNet September 2017 Tolerances accumulate when adjacent characters within a field are separated by a blank, that is a space of 0.250 ± 0.020 inch between the adjacent right-hand edges on either side of the blank space. Spacing tolerances within a field must not accumulate so that the boundaries of the field are infringed. Figure 3 Figure 4 An additional tolerance of ± 0.625 inch applies between fields when printing does not have to meet the requirements for adjacent character spacing. This applies only when fields are separated by a minimum of one blank space. 2.1.4 Alignment Alignment is the relative vertical location of characters within a given field. The alignment is measured relative to the horizontal centre line of each character.

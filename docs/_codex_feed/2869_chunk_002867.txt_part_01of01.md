not limited to, smartphones, smartwatches, fitness bands, key tags, and wearables such as jewelry. Payment Cards For purposes of PCI DSS, any payment card form factor that bears the logo of any PCI SSC Participating Payment Brand. Payment Channel Methods used by merchants to accept payments from customers. Common payment channels include card present (in person) and card not present (e-commerce and MO/TO). Payment Page A web-based user interface containing one or more form elements intended to capture account data from a consumer or submit captured account data, for purposes of processing and authorizing payment transactions. The payment page can be rendered as any one of: A single document or instance, A document or component displayed in an inline frame within a non-payment page, Multiple documents or components each containing one or more form elements contained in multiple inline frames within a non-payment page. Payment Page Scripts Any programming language commands or instructions on a payment page that are processed and/or interpreted by a consumer’s browser, including commands or instructions that interact with a page’s document object model. Examples of programming languages are JavaScript and VB script; neither markup-languages (for example, HTML) or style-rules (for example, CSS) are programming languages. Payment Processor Sometimes referred to as “payment gateway” or “payment service provider (PSP).” Entity engaged by a merchant or other entity to handle payment card transactions on their behalf. See Acquirers . PCI DSS Acronym for “Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.” Personnel Full-time and part-time employees, temporary employees, contractors, and consultants with security responsibilities for protecting account data or that can impact the security of cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data. See Visitor. Phishing Resistant Authentication Authentication designed to prevent the disclosure and use of authentication secrets to any party that is not the legitimate system to which the user is attempting to authenticate (for example, through in-the-middle (ITM) or impersonation attacks). Phishing-resistant systems often implement asymmetric cryptography as a core security control. Systems that rely solely on knowledge-based or time-limited factors such as passwords or one-time-passwords (OTPs) are not considered phishing resistant, nor are SMS or magic links. Examples of phishing-resistant authentication includes FIDO2. Physical Access Control Mechanisms that limit the access to a physical space or environment to only authorized persons. See Logical Access Control. PIN Acronym for “personal identification number.” Secret numeric password known only to the user and a system to authenticate the user to the system. The user is only granted access if the PIN the user provided matches the PIN in the system. Typical PINs are used for automated teller machines for cash advance transactions. Another type of PIN is one used in EMV chip cards where the PIN replaces the cardholder’s signature. PIN Block A block of data used to encapsulate a PIN during processing. The PIN block format defines the content of the PIN block and how it is processed to retrieve the PIN. The PIN block is composed of the PIN, the PIN length, and may contain subset of the PAN. POI Acronym for “Point of Interaction,” the initial point where data is read from a card. An electronic transaction-acceptance product, a POI consists of hardware and software and is hosted in acceptance equipment to enable a cardholder to perform a card transaction. The POI may be attended or unattended. POI transactions are typically integrated circuit (chip) and/or magnetic-stripe card-based payment transactions. Point of Sale System (POS) Hardware and software used by merchants to accept payments from customers. May include POI devices, PIN pads, electronic cash registers, etc. PPO’s Acronym for “Principal Participating Organization.” Privileged User Any user account with greater than basic access privileges. Typically, these accounts have elevated or increased privileges with more rights than a standard user account. However, the extent of privileges across different privileged accounts can vary greatly depending on the organization, job function or role, and the technology in use. r REB Acronym for “Regional Engagement Board.” Remote Access Access to an entity’s network from a location outside of that network. An example of technology for remote access is a VPN. Removable Electronic Media Media that stores digitized data that can be easily removed and/or transported from one computer system to another. Examples of removable electronic media include CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, USB flash drives, and external/portable hard drives. In this context, removable electronic media does not include hot-swappable drives, tape drives used for bulk back-ups, or other media not typically used to transport data from one location for use in another. RFC Acronym for “Request for Comment.” Risk Assessment Enterprise-wide process that identifies valuable system resources and threats; quantifies loss exposures (that is, loss potential) based on estimated frequencies and costs of occurrence; and (optionally) recommends how to allocate resources to countermeasures to minimize total exposure. See Targeted Risk Analysis. Risk Ranking Process of classifying risks to identify, prioritize, and address items in the order of importance. ROC Acronym for “Report on Compliance.” Reporting tool used to document detailed results from an entity’s PCI DSS assessment. RRG Acronym for “Roadmap Roundtable Group.” RSA Algorithm for public-key encryption. See Strong Cryptography. s SAQ Acronym for “Self-Assessment Questionnaire.” Reporting tool used to document self-assessment results from an entity’s PCI DSS assessment. Scoping Process of identifying all system components, people, and processes to be included in a PCI DSS assessment. See PCI DSS section: 4 Scope of PCI DSS Requirements . Secure Coding The process of creating and implementing applications

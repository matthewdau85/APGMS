System Obligations Advice showing a Participant’s multilateral net position in the contingency batch, including clearing interest. Where a failure to match remains unresolved, the RBA will apply Failure To Match rules and proceed with the contingency batch. 5.5.6 Failure To Match The RBA will apply Failure To Match rules in accordance with Clause 9.32(a) of these Procedures if two or more Participants cannot agree on the amount owing for a given obligation. 5.5.7 Reconciliation to RITS Participants should reconcile the internal record of payments (used to calculate their net bilateral obligations) to RITS when RITS recovers. Note: When RITS is recovered and the system date has rolled forward to the day after the HVCS Fallback Period, the SWIFT Feeder connection is restored. The backlog of HVCS settlement requests stored in the CSI will enter RITS and be rejected due to the back-dated value date. Participants can use the RITS UI to view and export the record of rejected T- Copy payments. Participants can also obtain the record of payments settled or rejected by RITS prior to the Disabling Event using MT950 statements or the RITS UI. Participants can use these RITS records to reconcile the internal records used to calculate the net bilateral obligations submitted to the RBA in the HVCS Exchange Summary Form, which could help to resolve failure(s) to match advised by the RBA in the HVCS Exchange Figures Advice. Where the reconciliation to RITS cannot be completed before 7am on the day after the HVCS Fallback Period, and the RBA has applied Failure To Match rules in order to proceed with the contingency batch, Participants can continue the reconciliation after the batch has settled and if required, bilaterally arrange the return or correction of a mistaken payment in normal way (in accordance with these Procedures). 5.5.8 ESA Funding Participants must fund any ESA balance shortfall that prevents the contingency batch from settling before the Morning Settlement Session ends. 5.6 Operational Capacity The following instructions describe the volume of payments that Participants are expected to be operationally capable of processing within the HVCS Fallback Period timeframes. HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 147 5.6.1 Payment Volumes Participants must be capable of processing the same volume of payments under T-Copy as they would under Y-Copy. That is, payment volumes must not be reduced during the HVCS Fallback Period because of operational capacity limitations. Note: For the avoidance of doubt, processing means undertaking the end-to-end steps in the RITS Outage Runsheet which includes exchanging clearing messages in T-Copy, applying funds to Customer accounts, submitting net bilateral settlement obligations to the RBA using the HVCS Exchange Summary Form, and resolving any failure to match discrepancies where required. This requires Participants to ensure the processes they use during a HVCS Fallback Period are scalable for business-as-usual payment volumes. 5.6.2 Staffing Participants must have a pre-determined plan to call on sufficient staff to undertake all steps set out in the RITS Outage Runsheet if a HVCS Fallback Period is declared. Where necessary, this will include non-payment operations staff from the credit, treasury or client account functions, or any other function required by a Participant to facilitate payment exchange during the HVCS Fallback Period. 5.6.3 Timings Participants must be capable of completing all steps set out in the RITS Outage Runsheet within the allocated timeframes. 5.7 Applying Funds A fundamental objective of the HVCS Fallback Solution is to minimise the potential for systemic disruption during a protracted RITS Disabling Event that could, in extremis, cause financial harm and undermine confidence in the payments system. To achieve this, it is important that Participants actively endeavour to make incoming funds available to Customers prior to deferred interbank settlement occurring the next day. This may require Participants to accept a higher degree of credit risk than when RITS is processing HVCS payments on a RTGS basis. It should be noted that the HVCS Fallback Solution is intended to be used in the event of a technical disruption to RITS during otherwise normal market conditions. The option to invoke the HVCS Fallback Solution would be assessed at the time considering all relevant factors, including prevailing market conditions. AusPayNet and the RBA could elect not to invoke the HVCS Fallback Solution in adverse conditions where deferred net settlement could give rise to undue risk. The following section provides instructions and guidance on the extent to which Participants are expected to apply funds to Customers during a HVCS Fallback Period. It makes a distinction between two relevant terms: • Posting: a Participant credits the beneficiary Customer’s account but does not make the funds available to the Customer until interbank settlement has occurred. Such credits are sometimes referred to as “uncleared funds” and denoted as a visible credit that does not yet form part of the balance of available funds. HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 148 • Availability: where a Participant enables the beneficiary Customer to make use of funds posted to the Customer’s account. This could be in advance of interbank settlement occurring. 5.7.1 Posting Participants must post funds received during a HVCS Fallback Period such that the credit entry is visible to the recipient Customer on the same day.

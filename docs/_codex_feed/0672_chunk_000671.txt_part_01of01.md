The use of RSA keys with a modulus of only 1024 bits shall be treated as single use keys; TDES key transport keys shall be treated as single use keys and destroyed after use. 67 B.5.22 Procedures exist to prevent or detect the unauthorized substitution (key replacement and key misuse) of one key for another or the operation of any cryptographic device without legitimate keys. 72 B.5.23 Any known or suspected compromised key and its subsidiary keys (those keys enciphered with the compromised key) shall be replaced with a value not feasibly related to the original key. 75 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 45 KIF Requirements Ref B.5.24 Key variants are only used in devices that possess the original key. Key variants are not used at different levels of the key hierarchy e.g., a variant of a key encipherment key used for key exchange cannot be used as a working key or as a master file key for local storage. 76 B.5.25 Secret and private keys and key components that are no longer used or have been replaced are securely destroyed. 81 B.5.26 Access to secret and private cryptographic keys and key material shall be limited to a need-to-know basis so that the fewest number of key custodians are necessary to enable their effective use. 82 B.5.27 Each person acting as a key custodian shall be designated as such and this designation documented on a Key Custodian Form which designates each custodian’s responsibilities and duties. Each custodian shall sign the Key Custodian Form as having read and understood these responsibilities and duties in relation to the key material entrusted to them. 82 B.5.28 Logs are kept for any time that keys, key components, or related materials are removed from storage or loaded to a SCD. 83 B.5.29 Backups of secret and private keys shall exist only for the purpose of reinstating keys that are accidentally destroyed or are otherwise inaccessible. The backups shall exist only in one of the allowed storage forms for that key. 84 B.5.30 Documented procedures exist and are demonstrably in use for all key management operations. 85 Next page is Annexure C IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE C.

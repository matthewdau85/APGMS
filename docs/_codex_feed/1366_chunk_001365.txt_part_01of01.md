Single Touch Payroll Advisory Group The Single Touch Payroll Advisory Group (STPAG) was formed to help design and implement the Single Touch Payroll (STP) initiative through members' collective knowledge, experience and influence. The group included representatives from a cross section of industry organisations, tax professionals and digital service providers, worked collaboratively to help shape and influence the design and implementation of STP. The intent was to maintain dialogue that enables a clear and mutual understanding of stakeholder perspectives throughout the implementation of STP. The Single Touch Payroll Advisory Group was closed in October 2020. We are seeking nominations for digital service provider representatives to join our new Single Touch Payroll (STP) advisory and Employer transition working groups . These groups are being established to help shape, influence and implement STP Phase two through members’ collective knowledge, experience and influence.

can be difficult to keep track of which hypervisors are running which VMs, as VMs can be dynamically assigned across a pool of hypervisors based upon load-balancing needs. Hypervisor configuration and access are particularly important, as a hypervisor provides a single point of entry to all its VMs and can potentially be used to gain access to sensitive data and resources on separate VMs. An additional consideration is the degree to which the hypervisor is used to deliver security functionality to the VMs. For example, a simple, hardened hypervisor may be very secure but offer limited security capabilities, whereas a more complex, security-capable hypervisor with improved functionality could potentially present a greater risk if compromised.22 Functionality that allows the hypervisor to control and monitor individual VM activity from outside the VMs is known as introspection. Hypervisor introspection expands the functionality of the hypervisor to allow a deeper analysis of the data being processed by the VM, and typically includes visibility into stored data files as well as monitoring of network traffic, memory and program execution, and other elements of the VM. Depending on the particular technology implemented, introspection can provide the Provider23 with a level of real-time auditing of VM activity that may otherwise be unattainable. This can help the Provider to monitor for and detect suspicious activity within and between VMs. Additionally, introspection may facilitate cloud-efficient implementations of traditional security controlsfor example, hypervisor-managed security functions such as malware protection, access controls, firewalling and intrusion detection between VMs. Two potential challenges with introspection are that it can bypass role-based access controls and that it can be used without leaving a forensic audit trail within the VM itself. For example, to view a data file, a user typically authenticates to the VM, resulting in an authentication audit trail and ensuring that the user’s access is controlled according to that user's defined permissions. If file-access logging is enabled in the VM and the user views a file, the access is recorded to show what was accessed by whom and when. With introspection, files can be accessed from within the privileged state of the hypervisor. As no authentication to the VM itself is required, file access leaves no audit trail on the VM, and the VM contains no evidence that the file was accessed. In this example, the access would need to be logged via the introspection tool itself, which would typically not be in the Customer’s control. While this may be less of an issue within a private cloud environment, it is an important consideration for Customers 22 Tim Mather, Don’t Bloat the Hypervisor! What to know about Introspection (Webinar), 2011. 23 Joe Security LLC, Joe Security's Blog, “Level Up: Introducing Hypervisor based Inspection in Joe Sandbox,” https://joesecurity.org/blog/68779205757215410 (20 June 2017).

Research has been presented on detecting hypervisor activity within a VM 24 and hardware-assisted hypervisor introspection.25 Additionally, since introspection is designed to have full visibility into each VM, it may be difficult to restrict such access to only specific files or programs in memory. Any personnel (for example, Provider employees or possibly other hosted Customers) with access to the introspection function could potentially have access to data and processes on any VM running on that hypervisor. Introspection access must therefore be carefully managed, controlled and monitored to ensure that role-based access and segregation of duties are maintained. For example, the ability to configure introspection auditing should not be available to personnel with the ability to access hosted VMs via the introspection tool. Providers can leverage products that provide Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI, also referred to as Guest Introspection). Providers have marketplaces with security products, such as those for AV, IPS and FIM, that provide protection from a central source appliance to virtual machines with minimal or no agent implementations. These products produce logs that can be reviewed by security information and event management SIEMs and participate in an alerting implementation. Providers using introspection-based products should be able to provide their Customers with all applicable introspection logs for that Customer’s environment including, but not limited to, authentication details, disk and memory access requests and API calls. All introspection activity should be mapped to the individual user account performing the activity, and logs should be reviewed on a continual basis to ensure that the integrity and confidentiality of Customer data have been maintained. Where introspection is used by a third-party Provider, the Customers may wish to consider implementing data-level security controls (such as strong cryptography with all key storage and encryption/decryption operations external to the cloud service) to avoid exposing sensitive data to the enhanced monitoring features that introspection provides. E.7 Containers Containerization is an increasingly popular technology for efficiently running many instances of a server or application. It has resource, security and security isolation properties similar to those of virtual machines, but not the memory and performance overhead inherent in system-level hypervisors. Container orchestration platforms are becoming an increasingly popular service offering that allows Customers to spin an instance or a swarm of containers, and dynamically control the computing output capacity. 24 Gary Wang, Zachary J.

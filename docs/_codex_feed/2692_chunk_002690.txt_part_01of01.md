replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 13 2.4 Telephony Considerations and Demarcation Points To fully understand the extent to which an entity’s telephony environment is in scope for PCI DSS, one must first identify the key demarcation points within the telephony environment that separate the services provided by the entity and any supporting services provided by third-party service providers. Consider the following definition of a service provider provided in the PCI SSC Online Glossary3: [A] business entity that is not a payment brand, directly involved in the processing, storage, or transmission of cardholder data on behalf of another entity. This also includes companies that provide services that control or could impact the security of cardholder data. Examples include managed service providers that provide managed firewalls, IDS and other services as well as hosting providers and other entities. If an entity provides a service that involves only the provision of public network access—such as a telecommunications company providing just the communication link—the entity would not be considered a service provider for that service (although they may be considered a service provider for other services). Table 5 provides some example scenarios involving the use of third-party service providers, how the use of those service providers may impact an entity’s PCI DSS scope, and some additional factors that should be taken into consideration: Table 5 – Scope for service providers Entity Scenario In scope for PCI DSS? Additional factors that may impact scope Telecommunication companies (telco) The entity supplies access to public network (analog, digital, and/or IP telephony based), only supporting the point-to-point distribution of call traffic. Considered out of scope Some telecommunication equipment owned and operated by the telco, hosted within the entity’s infrastructure for the purpose of provisioning access to public network, may be considered in scope for PCI DSS. One or several service providers (possibly including a telco) providing services such as, for example: IVR, call recording, SIP trunking. The entities provide a service involving processing, transmitting, or storing account data on behalf of the entity or affecting the security of payment card data. Considered in scope The telco or service providers should have their own PCI DSS validation covering the services they provide, or they would need to be included in the entity’s PCI DSS assessment. All the relevant service providers should be included in the telephony dataflow. A clear understanding of where the responsibility of each service provider for securing the telephony infrastructure starts and ends, using diagrams that include clearly marked service demarcation points. 3 Online Glossary: https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/glossary#S Information Supplement • Protecting Telephone-Based Payment Card Data • November 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 14 Documenting clear demarcation points for all supporting services and defining the moment in the call flow at which the entity takes responsibility, helps the entity define its CDE. If at any point an entity stores, processes, or transmits account data within its environment, the entity’s systems and networks through which the account data is stored, processed, or transmitted fall within the scope of the PCI DSS, and applicable PCI DSS Requirements must be met irrespective of the type of network the entity has deployed. For example, a VoIP network transmitting account data would be subject to the same PCI DSS requirements as would an internal IP-based network that transmits account data. Additionally, PCI DSS Requirement 4.1 would apply wherever account data is transmitted over a shared or public VoIP service. Where “voice” traffic from the public telecommunications network (i.e., carrier) terminates on equipment owned and operated by the entity or a service provider and is then sent (regardless of whether it is analog, digital, or VoIP transmission) to a third-party service provider, the demarcation point is the equipment owned by the entity or the third-party service provider and should be considered in scope for PCI DSS. This scenario is represented by the Virtual Private Branch Exchange (PBX) system in Diagram 6.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 15 Where the telephony traffic terminates on equipment owned and operated by the third-party service provider, this equipment should be protected, configured, maintained, and monitored in accordance with applicable PCI DSS requirements. Everything after the third-party equipment should be considered in scope. If the third-party equipment resides on the entity’s premises, there may be a split PCI DSS responsibility between the entity and the service provider. The process used by the entity or a service provider to demonstrate compliance with PCI DSS, including for controls that rely on a third-party service provider, is discussed in detail in the Information Supplement: Third- Party Security Assurance.4 2.5 Systems and Networks Mistakenly Excluded from Scope Telephony environments are only as secure as their weakest link. Risks may not be considered when systems or networks are wrongly excluded from PCI DSS scope; this is often the result of two scenarios:  Improperly secured access from a third party or an application residing outside the CDE: Components that are often improperly secured include networks and systems not directly involved in the payment process, but that have connectivity to payment systems or the telephony environment where payment card data

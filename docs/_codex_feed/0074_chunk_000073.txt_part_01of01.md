will also be important for facilitating the development and adoption of AI technologies. We also encourage the Government to consider measures that would assist businesses in adopting AI technology, including the provision of tools to help verify that an AI-enabled system meets the necessary standards. top Economic Crime Forum (ECF) update As we have noted before, we stand at a generational tipping point in payments, with two once-in-a-lifetime opportunities: to modernise payments regulation to simplify the payments system. However, alongside these generational opportunities, we have one generational obligation: to mitigate scams, which unfortunately affect far too many Australian consumers and businesses. AusPayNet is a member of the National Anti-Scam Centre (NASC) Advisory Board and the NASC’s investment scam fusion cell. To support the NASC and ACCC, we continue to leverage our Economic Crime Forum (ECF). In August, the ECF met in Canberra and discussed appropriate friction in payments and initiatives to disrupt money mule accounts, and continued to develop intelligence packages for law enforcement to disrupt transnational organised crime engaging in scams. AusPayNet remains ready to contribute to the forthcoming consultation on national anti-scam codes. Australian Payment Fraud Report AusPayNet’s 2023 Australian Payment Fraud Report highlights that in 2022, the fraud rate was 57.5 cents per $1,000 spent, up slightly from 57.3 cents in 2021. Card fraud increased by 16.5% from the previous year, to $577 million, in line with the increase in total spending on cards, which rose 16% to $1 trillion over the same period. The data indicates that the fraud rate has stabilised since the introduction of the industry’s card-not-present (CNP) Fraud Mitigation Framework in 2019, with the 2022 fraud rate remaining well below the fraud rate of 75.0 cents per $1,000 spent in 2017. CNP fraud accounted for 90% of all fraud on Australian cards in 2022, increasing by 14.4% from 2021 to $516.8 million, reflecting the sustained and rapid rise in e-commerce, which accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. CNP fraud actually declined in Australia (by 4.8%), but CNP fraud overseas (on Australian-issued cards) increased almost 50%. The CNP Fraud Mitigation Framework only applies to merchants based in Australia. Cheque fraud dropped 24% to $2.4 million in 2022, in line with the rapid consumer decline of cheques as a method of payment.

We have designed, and are currently consulting on, a proposed governance model, funding principles and high-level model for standards development and enforcement. The following broadly details the proposed model: A panel will make decisions relating to approval and enforcement of standards. The panel will be made up of independent experts, appointed by a panel appointment committee. The panel will have the power to make its own decisions, subject to two caveats: firstly, it will be expected to consult with relevant regulators in relation to the approval of standards (to ensure those standards meet regulatory requirements). Secondly, it will be required to inform ASIC of issues that may need to be investigated as a potential breach of the Corporations Act. The panel’s work will be subject to an external assurance review mechanism to ensure it meets its objectives. AusPayNet’s Board will appoint the panel appointment committee and will have ultimate responsibility for ensuring the standards-setting body (as a whole) retains its authorisation and performs in accordance with requirements set by the RBA. The ASSB work will be funded by licensees on a fixed and tiered fee basis. AusPayNet continues to design the operating models for the various components of the ASSB function and is developing a detailed pipeline of technical standards that are likely to be in scope for the ASSB. AusPayNet will formally consult with the industry, regulators, and other key stakeholders on both of these pieces of work in due course. top ISO 20022 migration For a high-level update regarding the progress of the ISO 20022 Industry Migration Program, please refer to the latest quarterly issue of Migration Monitor on AusPayNet’s website , published in July. top Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) migration program update In December 2022, work commenced on developing a Program Initiation Document (PID) for the AES Migration Program, detailing the background, rationale, approach, and plan for migrating to AES for the national card payments system. A consultative approach was taken to developing the PID, allowing Members to review, endorse, and validate content for the PID through several working groups, representing Members from the Issuers and Acquirers Community (IAC). Since December 2022, four iterations of working group meetings have been held, resulting in the final draft of the PID being endorsed in May 2023. The plan to migrate to AES has two phases: Initiation and Mobilisation (July 2023 – December 2024): This phase includes preparatory activities to finalise outstanding issues – including the technical blueprint, testing strategy, migration approach, legal, risk and compliance assessment – to provide time for participants to formalise their business cases, secure funding, and mobilise teams. It is anticipated that participants will be ready to commence their programs by January 2025. Execution (January 2025 – December 2030): This phase includes industry readiness activities leading to an industry pilot, with migration to follow. An extended period of coexistence has been planned for the migration. This enables assets to be

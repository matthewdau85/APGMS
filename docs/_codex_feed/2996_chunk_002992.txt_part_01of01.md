for PCI DSS. To reduce the scope of the PCI DSS assessment, the Provider must have necessary segmentation in place, and take express responsibility for these controls. For Providers providing shared hosting of VDI services, the hosting solution should enforce cloud tenant separation that is appropriate to multi-tenant cloud environments (see Section E2, “Multi-tenancy,” for further information). As server configurations vary, so too Customer workstation configurations may have a significant range of applicable controls. The three most common VDI workstation types include: ▪ Zero Client: These systems provide little more than video, keyboard and mouse interface to the network host. Without a processor or memory space to host malware, zero-client configurations offer minimal attack surface, and interception of sensitive data would require physical intrusion 27 PCI Security Standards Council, Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation (PCI SSC, December 2016), https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Guidance-PCI-DSS-Scoping-and- Segmentation_v1.pdf.

Once physical controls and terminal capabilities are confirmed, an assessor may deem that no additional controls are required. ▪ Thin Client: A lightweight operating system is generally installed on these systems to support the connection to the host but may also include support for configurable applications that run locally. For this reason, thin-client workstations may be considered in scope and subject to many workstation controls. Certain PCI DSS requirements, such as Requirement 5, may be deemed inapplicable if the underlying OS is not commonly affected by malware. However, it is not sufficient to assume that thin-client workstations are out of scope entirely for these controls. ▪ Conventional Workstation: A full workstation that supports remote desktop connections to the CDE is considered fully in scope as an administrator workstation. The PCI Security Standards Council has published the Information Supplement Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation, which is intended to provide further understanding of scoping and segmentation principles for administrator workstations as applicable to the PCI DSS environment.28 In each of the scenarios above, it is crucial for the Provider and Customer to have clearly communicated responsibilities and network diagrams detailing segmentation boundaries and network locations pertaining to the physical hardware, hypervisor, virtual networks, guest OS, VDI/remote desktop service, disk images and all application binaries and configurations. Furthermore, as multi- tenant DaaS offerings are built upon mixed-mode environments and delivered as a service using varied levels of Customer access capability, thorough documentation and clear communication of responsibilities become critical to ensure that all relevant protections are confirmed in place and maintained by the responsible parties. E.9 Elastic Resources Inventory and Control Cloud architectures that are designed to elastically scale can present challenges that affect several PCI DSS Requirements, including Requirements 2.4, 6.4, 10.2.7, 11.3.1 and 11.3.2, among others. In order to best evaluate adherence of elastically generated environments to the requirements of the PCI Data Security Standard, an organization should assess the controls around the scaling automation. ▪ The template images from which elastic resources are instantiated should be reviewed for adherence to system configuration standards and security controls (e.g., PCI DSS Requirements 2.1, 2.2 and 5.1). ▪ The environment to which elastic resources are deployed should be evaluated for adherence to network segmentation rules (e.g., PCI DSS Requirements 1.2, 1.3 and 7.2). ▪ Because the inventory of system components (as required by PCI DSS Requirement 2.4) can change dynamically, the elastic automation should log all system creation and destruction activities to provide the ability to report on the inventory over time or at a specific instance in time. 28 PCI Security Standards Council, Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation (PCI SSC, December 2016), https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Guidance-PCI-DSS-Scoping-and- Segmentation_v1.pdf.

E.10 Data Encryption and Cryptographic Key Management In a public cloud environment, one Customer’s data is typically stored with data belonging to multiple other Customers. This makes a public cloud an attractive target for attackers, as the potential gain may be greater than that to be attained from attacking a number of organizations individually. Strong data-level encryption should be enforced on all sensitive or potentially sensitive data stored in a

This page provides information to assist digital service providers (DSPs) (which includes Sending Service Providers) with implementing the Cloud software authentication and authorisation (CAA) solution. The CAA solution is part of the ATO’s authentication and authorisation solution, which includes myID, RAM and Access Manager. Summary The CAA solution allows a business or tax practitioner to authorise a DSP’s dedicated machine credential for the purposes of securing a transmission/lodgment to the ATO via online 'cloud' software. How does it work? The DSP: registers their software product with the ATO Digital Partnership Office (DPO) meets the security requirements for the Operational Security Framework assesses, tests and certifies their software against the current (SBR1, SBR2 and ATO API portal) testing process creates a CAA request ticket in Online services for DSPs. The DSP nominates a dedicated machine credential (in Access Manager) which is used to secure transmissions initiated by their business clients via online (cloud-enabled) software. The DSP develops the capability to generate and issue their clients with a unique Software Subscription ID (SSID), commonly referred to as a ‘Software ID’, based on the requirements described below. Client on-boarding The DSP issues a unique Software ID to each subscriber to their software. The DSP’s clients are asked to contact the ATO and authorise the DSP via Access Manager using their myID or over the phone (they must be verified as a business associate to use the phone channel) and provide their ‘Software ID’. Transmission Once the business initiates a transmission (e.g. lodges), the lodgment data (including the Software ID) is sent to the ATO and is secured using the DSP’s dedicated machine credential. Once the lodgment data is received, the ATO verifies that the authorisation between the DSP and the business exists, and the Software ID matches the one provided by the business in Access Manager. For registered agents the relationship between their business and their client is also verified. DSP Requirements To provide services using the CAA solution, DSPs will be required to ensure their software product meets the requirements outlined below. These are CAA-specific requirements only, other existing SBR, ATO API and machine credential requirements and standards apply. You will be required to certify that you have met these requirements via a CAA request through Online services for DSPs, before being granted access as an online software provider (hosted SBR software service provider) in Access Manager. Software ID requirements The following outlines the requirements around the software's automatic generation of a Software ID. For DSP products that directly connect to the ATO, the Software ID must : be generated using the algorithm provided below and contain 10 digits (leading zeroes are required) be unique for each subscription or instance of software be passed to the user via a secured electronic communication or over the phone be given to the user for the purposes of notifying the ATO of a software provider’s services. For STP Sending Service Provider products the Software ID must : be generated by SSPs using the algorithm provided below, containing 10 digits (leading zeroes are required) be unique for each payroll software product, ensuring no duplication within the SSP’s SSID suite be provided to authorised users (via DSPs or directly) through secured electronic communication or over the phone be given to the user for the purposes of notifying the ATO of a software provider’s services. The Software ID must not : be keyed in by the user for each transmission be used as a credential to authenticate the client within online software for lodgment. Software ID generation algorithm Generate the first 9 digits of the Software ID (can be a randomly generated). Pad the generated number with leading zeroes on the left to make a 9-digit string. Calculate the sum of all digits in the string and apply the Modulo 10 division to calculate the remainder. Use the remainder as the 10th control digit. Concatenate the generated 9 digits (from step 2) with the control digit (from step 4) to form a 10-digit Software ID. The next table provides a few examples of Software ID generation. Generated number Zero padded string (9 characters) Sum of all digits Remainder from division by 10 (control digit) Software ID 1 000000001 0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+1 = 1 1 0000000011 2 000000002 0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+2 = 2 2 0000000022 - - - - - 478593 000478593 0+0+0+4+7+8+5+9+3=36 6 0004785936 Additional responsibilities Compliant with Terms of Use – Business Machine Certificate and associated policies The current Terms of use – Business Machine Certificate outlines the responsibilities placed upon machine credential holders. The Machine Credential Administrator and the organisation are jointly and severally responsible for the storage and use of the Business Machine Certificate including all transactions and communications carried out under or using it. Failure to uphold these responsibilities will result in the cancellation of the credential. Cyber security and end user authentication requirements of the Operational Security Framework The ATO Operational Security Framework (OSF) sets out the minimum level of cyber security requirements a DSP needs to meet to access ATO digital services. The OSF includes a range of requirements which may include multi-factor authentication (MFA). Taxpayer declaration requirements of the Common Business Implementation Guide and service specific implementation guides Before lodging a form, a user (business representative or authorised intermediary) must provide an appropriate declaration as outlined in the Payroll event Business Implementation Guide and the ATO Common Business Implementation and Taxpayer Declaration Guide.

Payment Security Industry Leaders Collaborate to Help Protect Payment Data and Discuss the Modern Threat Landscape DUBLIN , 26 October 2023 — More than 700 in person and online stakeholders from Europe and around the world convened this week in Dublin for the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) Europe Community Meeting . The multi-day event focused on updates in payment security standards and programs, and provided industry stakeholders with opportunities to learn, share, network, and discuss the current state of payment security. A top priority for the PCI SSC at this year’s meeting was to provide insights and answer stakeholder questions regarding the PCI DSS v4.0. Additionally, the Council held discussions and presentations on its Software Security Framework Standards and its new mobile standard, Mobile Payments on COTS (MPoC), which was released late last year. The Council also continues to look for ways to foster collaboration among its global stakeholders. This event is one of the many ways stakeholders can provide feedback, ask questions, and help influence the direction of PCI Security Standards and programs. “Global industry collaboration is critical to our mission of securing payment data worldwide,” said PCI SSC VP, EMEA, Jeremy King. “The Europe Community Meeting gives us a great opportunity to have important face-to-face discussions with our international community of payment industry stakeholders, which allows us to continue to grow and develop our programs and standards with their input.” “The Community Meetings are an essential part of what we do at the Council; bringing together a “community” of payment security experts from around the world to share information and learn from each other,” said PCI SSC Executive Director Lance J. Johnson. “This meeting in Dublin underscored just how rapidly the payment landscape continues to evolve and why we must stay vigilant to both the threats and the new technologies in our industry to ensure safer payments worldwide.” News from the meeting included: New PCI DSS v4.0 Resources New Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) documents: Find the newly published Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) Instructions and Guidelines and SAQ for Software-based PIN Entry on COTS solutions (SPoC) for PCI DSS v4.0 in the PCI SSC Document Library . PCI DSS v4.0 Resource Hub: Bookmark the PCI DSS v4.0 Resource Hub to find the most up-to-date Council-created educational materials on PCI DSS v4.0.

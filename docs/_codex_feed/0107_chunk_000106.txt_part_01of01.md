(ELNOs) and other subject matter experts to develop an Industry Code for eConveyancing payments. Development was halted at industry’s request during much of 2022; however, once resumed, a year of consultation with key participants in the eConveyancing industry, drafting and review, culminated in the eConveyancing Payments Industry Code (eC1) being approved by the AusPayNet Board on 31 August. The Code marks the creation of the first Framework at AusPayNet for nearly a decade and provides regulations and operating procedures to ensure that all parties involved in eConveyancing financial transactions have a common set of rules and mutually understood obligations. This will be especially important as eConveyancing evolves to an interoperable model, with ELNOs sharing information related to the financial legs of a property settlement. Now that the Code has been approved, we can move to the implementation stage of the project. In consultation with the e-conveyancing industry, in the coming months we will finalise the timeline for eC1 to be effective. top Cross-border payments update Recently, we published the latest edition of our Cross-Border Payments Round-Up , which provides a summary of activities, our responses to consultations, and other actions being undertaken to support and successfully implement the roadmap and domestic cross-border payment priorities. You can access the newsletter on AusPayNet’s website . top ISO 20022 migration update For a high-level update regarding the progress of the ISO 20022 Industry Migration Program, please refer to the latest quarterly issue of Migration Monitor on AusPayNet’s website , published in October. top Economic crime update The Economic Crime Forum (ECF) was held on 13 November in Melbourne, coinciding with national police meetings and International Fraud Awareness Week. We continue to represent Members on the National Anti-Scam Centre (NASC) Advisory Board and fusion cell workgroups. The NASC has been operational since July, and it is pleasing to see the Centre bringing in all industries across the scam lifecycle to do their part to address scams. AusPayNet has participated in several legislative consultations that have touch points to scam mitigation and will inform the national codes and potential areas where technical standards may be required: Modernising Australia’s AML/CTF regime The PSRA The Digital Identity Bill The Regulation of Digital and Crypto Assets Bill The payments licensing framework. Treasury is progressing its work on the national anti-scam codes, with consultation on the framework and legislation expected by the end of 2023. AusPayNet continues to engage closely with Treasury and the ACCC ahead of the release of the first consultation. We welcome thoughts, feedback, and suggestions. top Board changes Westpac-appointed Director In recent months, Nish Dharmaratne replaced Chris Campbell on AusPayNet’s Board as the Westpac-appointed Director. Mr Campbell served as a Director of AusPayNet for over 20 years, including serving on various committees as chair and as a member. We thank Mr Campbell for his contributions to the Board and to the committees on which he served. Elected Director Kees Kwakernaak resigned from AusPayNet’s Board on 31 August. By extension, his alternate, Mark Tibbles , also resigned. Mr Kwakernaak’s resignation triggered an election for the vacant seat, which has a remaining term of two years. The outcome of this election was that Bianca Bates (JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA) was elected to the vacant Director’s position, with Kirstin Renner (Citibank NA) to be appointed as an Alternate Director. We thank both Mr Kwakernaak and Mr Tibbles for their contributions to the Board and to the committees on which they served. Alternate Director Rebekah Murchie (National Australia Bank) was appointed as an Alternate Director. Meet the AusPayNet Board here .

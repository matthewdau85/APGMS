In 2009, AusPayNet developed the ATM Access Code. It is a co-regulatory regime that, in conjunction with the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA’s) ATM Access Regime, facilitates access to the ATM network. ATM Access Australia Limited (AAAL) has administered the Code since its inception. In November 2023, the RBA’s Payments System Board (PSB) discussed the effect of the structural decline in transactional cash and ATM use on ATM deployment and market structure. The PSB noted that the RBA would engage with AusPayNet to ensure the Code remains fit for purpose and appropriately governed. In December 2024, the Board of AAAL approved a proposal to convert the Access Code into the ATM Access Standard (Standard), to be administered by AusPayNet. AusPayNet then began to develop the Standard. AAAL members were closely consulted throughout the development of the Standard. AusPayNet also engaged closely with the RBA, as amendments to the ATM Access Regime were required to enable the Standard’s implementation. In addition, the Issuers and Acquirers Forum was consulted to ensure awareness and provide an opportunity for feedback. In June 2025, the final draft Standard was endorsed by AAAL directors and approved by its members. On 19 June, AusPayNet’s Board approved the Standard. The Standard formally commences on 1 October 2025. From this date, all relevant obligations and governance arrangements under the Standard take effect. Once the Standard commences, AAAL will be deregistered and AusPayNet will assume its role as administrator of the Standard.

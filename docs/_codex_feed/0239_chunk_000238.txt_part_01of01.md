Financial institutions exchange high value payments in HVCS using the SWIFT Payment Delivery System (PDS). Each payment is settled individually using the Reserve Bank Information and Transfer System (RITS). Each financial institution holds an exchange settlement account within RITS and payment is settled across these accounts on a real-time basis. As the funds are settled at the same time as the payment detail is transferred, settlement risk is reduced.

The Software developers website has been designed by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) specifically for digital service providers (DSPs). This audience includes those who develop and deliver tax and super related digital services to the community, including software developers, gateway providers, third-party providers, clearing houses and system implementers. We work with DSPs to integrate our services with their products, enabling seamless interactions and reporting. The purpose of the site is to provide timely information which aids the development of tax and super related software. You will find reporting specifications, guides and instructions, industry engagement information, tax return stationery, statement of formulas/tax tables, known outages and commonly used acronyms on this site. PLEASE NOTE: This site is not intended for taxpayers who have difficulties with their tax lodgments, submissions or payments. Refer to ato.gov.au for the relevant contact details for your enquiry.

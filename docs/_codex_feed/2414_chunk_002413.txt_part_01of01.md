Documents published on the Federal Register of Legislation do not constitute legal advice and Register helpdesk staff are unable to provide advice or assist in interpreting legislation. The purpose of the Register is only to publish Commonwealth legislation. For general guidance please contact the agency responsible for the law and associated services and programs for advice. Information about which agency is responsible for the legislation is available on the legislation's title page. Alternatively you may need legal advice from a lawyer familiar with the specific area of law you are interested in. If you cannot afford a private lawyer , low cost or free legal advice may be available through Legal Aid or a Community Legal Centre . It may also be necessary to organise a translator or interpreter if you are not confident with the English language, or if the matter involves documents in languages other than English . Legal Aid services are funded by the Australian Government and/or the State or Territory Government, depending on which laws are involved. Matters dealt with by legal aid commissions include: criminal matters, such as legal representation of a person charged with a criminal offence civil matters including: discrimination on the basis of disability, gender, marital status, or race migration benefits and compensation payable by the Commonwealth consumer protection claims relating to professional negligence, loss or destruction of property, personal injury, and wills and estates family law issues such as injunctions relating to family violence, orders relating to children and spousal/child maintenance For further information on telephone and face to face services and eligibility for legal aid see the relevant website.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 38 Appendix C: Applicability of PCI DSS Requirements to Assets Type The Table 2: Applicability of PCI DSS Requirements to Assets Type below is an example of how an organization may identify assets within their environment and the related applicable controls that should be taken into consideration while maintaining PCI-DSS compliance. The table is not designed to provide a comprehensive list of all types of assets but only provide guidance and offer a template that may be used as a starting point, to be customized with the specific details of the organization’s cardholder data environment. Within the table several types of assets and their associated, and, as an example, specific applicable requirements have been identified and marked by “X”. In the event an asset or specific requirement is managed by a third-party service provider, the table provides a method for identifying such detail as well. “SP1” is used as an example of a placeholder that could be used to identify a specific service provider. Once complete, the table should serve as a resource for the personnel responsible for maintaining the organization’s compliance program. This resource may be incorporated into the organization’s change-management process to help determine the controls that must be implemented in order to maintain PCI-DSS compliance.

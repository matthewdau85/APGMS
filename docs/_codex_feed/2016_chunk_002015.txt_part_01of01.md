17 May 2024 Digital ID Laws and Budget Key to a More Secure Digital Economy – AP+ 1 MEDIA RELEASE DIGITAL ID LAWS AND BUDGET KEY TO A MORE SECURE DIGITAL ECONOMY – AP+ Australian Payments Plus (AP+), at the forefront of Australia’s payments industry and a trusted national solution provider of digital identity through ConnectID, today welcomed the passage of the Digital ID Bills in the Parliament. Head of Product & Scheme Digital ID, Rick Iversen said the new laws, together with the funding support contained in Tuesday night’s Budget were concrete advances in Australia's journey towards a more secure and inclusive digital future. “Through ConnectID, businesses and consumers alike benefit from authenticated, trusted sources of ID verification without the creation of new honeypots of data,” Mr Iversen said. The new Digital ID laws will create a secure, cohesive digital identity framework, allowing for the development of a more efficient and secure digital ecosystem. This will allow business to prosper and consumers to navigate the digital space with greater ease, privacy and confidence. ”We also welcome the announcement of $288 million in the Budget to support the implementation and growth of digital identity,” Mr Iversen said. ”It’s great to see a commitment to realising the benefits that a strong Digital Identity ecosystem will offer Australian consumers and businesses. ”As we’ve always said, the fewer times people share their identity documents, the fewer opportunities there are for data theft.” AP+ and ConnectID will work with the Government wherever able, to test use cases between governments and the private sector. ConnectID has been developed in conjunction with banks and other financial institutions and is live with several major banks already, including NAB and CBA. “AP+ and ConnectID are pleased to be part of Australia’s digital identity journey, using the benefits of the ecosystem to improve functionality and security for both consumers and businesses,” Mr Iversen said.

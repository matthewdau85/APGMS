ML/TF risks relevant to each business Clarifying the scope of services subject to AML/CTF regulation and considering greater alignment in definitions between the AML/CTF regime and Treasury’s proposed payment service provider (PSP) licensing framework Adopting further changes to the tipping-off provisions to better enable collaboration across the ecosystem to help facilitate the detection and disruption of economic crime Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory reporting frameworks, including by ensuring that regulators and law enforcement have the tools and resources required to effectively analyse and act on the intelligence acquired Futureproofing the regime by only including the overarching, principles-based obligations in the AML/CTF Act, supported by clear and comprehensive Rules and Guidance that help businesses better understand how to meet these obligations Ensuring that reporting entities are given sufficient time for effective implementation of any changes, given the significant technological and procedural uplift that is likely to be required. We welcomed the additional information provided by the Department in the second consultation, although further detail will be required to fully understand and assess the scope and impact of some of the proposed changes. We therefore look forward to further engagement with the Department as additional detail on the proposed reforms, including the draft Bill and Rules, becomes available in the coming months. Response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement’s Inquiry into the capability of law enforcement to respond to cybercrime In July, AusPayNet made a submission to a Parliamentary inquiry into the capability of law enforcement to respond to cybercrime. Given AusPayNet’s remit and expertise, our submission focused on the key challenges and opportunities for law enforcement in countering cyber-enabled economic crime, particularly online scams, fraud, and money laundering, including: The importance of cross-agency coordination and public-private partnerships (such as AusPayNet’s Economic Crime Forum) in enhancing law enforcement's ability to detect and respond to cybercrime. We encouraged the Government to continue prioritising the removal of any barriers to appropriate information sharing arrangements, which are critical to providing law enforcement with quality intelligence leads across all areas of cyber-enabled crime The need for international collaboration to support law enforcement’s ability to effectively investigate and respond to cybercrime, since many criminal syndicates are located offshore Ongoing challenges related to the quality and availability of cybercrime intelligence, and the potential to significantly improve law enforcement's ability to identify and respond to cybercrime by addressing the current fragmentation of reporting channels, and improving the effectiveness of reporting processes The role of the financial sector in intercepting and recouping proceeds of cybercrime, including through initiatives such as the AFCX Fraud Reporting Exchange. Authorised standards-setting body (ASSB) program update On 23 May, the Payments System Board decided to adjust and clarify the RBA’s Tokenisation Expectations for the industry and endorsed AusPayNet to undertake further work to develop potential technical standards to support token portability. This was based on feedback from the Tokenisation Industry Working Group convened by AusPayNet. AusPayNet has now convened the Tokenisation Standards Development Working Group (TSDWG) to support us in drafting a potential standard on the porting of tokens and PAN-related data either to or from a payment service provider. The TSDWG comprises 18 entities involved in the porting process, and the output of the TSDWG is expected to be presented for public consultation in Q4 2024. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) migration program update Progress on Phase 1 (Initiation and Mobilisation) deliverables in 2024 for the program is tracking well, particularly in the Standards and Requirements, Migration Planning, and Industry Testing Working Groups. Delivery of the AES Technical Blueprint Handbook and Migration Strategy are tracking ahead and to schedule, respectively. To provide further detail: The Migration Planning Working Group held their fifth meeting in July. Version 1.0 of the Migration Strategy has been released, following approval by the Issuers and Acquirers Forum (IAF) The Standards and Requirements Working Group (SRWG) held their sixth meeting in July The Industry Testing Working Group (ITWG) held their inaugural meeting in June. Consultation with the IAF on a change of governance for the program and the establishment of an AES Migration Steering Committee (delegated from the Board) has commenced. Feedback is due from IAF Members in August. Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS) update As the custodians of the BECS Framework, AusPayNet is committed to ensuring that the transition away from the framework is managed responsibly, with no disruption to the efficient and secure flow of essential payments. To achieve this outcome, AusPayNet is leading several activities that have been categorised into three dimensions: 'control', 'collaborate', and 'coordinate'. Control the future of the framework AusPayNet will continually test the validity of the target end-date based on the industry’s progress on transitioning BECS use cases off the BECS Framework, and intends to provide an update on the target end-date for the framework to its Members and key stakeholders on a half-yearly basis. Collaborate with industry AusPayNet is collaborating with regulators and industry participants on a number of initiatives to facilitate the migration away from the BECS Framework. These include: Treasury’s engagement with relevant government agencies and other key users of BECS bulk payments on their needs and readiness to transition away from BECS The RBA’s risk assessment for the decommissioning of BECS, monitoring of NPP readiness (covering account reach, cost, capabilities for direct debit and bulk payments, capacity and reliability) and FSS readiness to take on BECS volumes, and Account-to-Account Pricing Study Initiatives or programs established by providers of

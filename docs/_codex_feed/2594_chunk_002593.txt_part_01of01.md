When a CPSA Company qualifies for Remediation, the CPSA Company will be notified in accordance with the CPSA Agreement, typically via registered or overnight mail and/or e-mail. Once the CPSA Company signs the agreement to participate in Remediation (“Remediation Agreement”) and pays the fee(s) required in the notification, the applicable listing on the CPSA List will be annotated with “In Remediation” and the listing will display the CPSA Company’s details in red text. Refer to the Website – PCI SSC Programs Fee Schedule for details of all applicable fees. At the time of notification that the CPSA Company qualifies for Remediation, AQM will provide the CPSA Company with information on the requirements and procedures of the Remediation process and what it entails. Once AQM has gained sufficient assurance of quality improvement and confirmed to the CPSA Company in writing that the requirements of the Remediation Agreement have been fulfilled, Remediation ends, and the CPSA Company’s listing on the Website returns to “In Good Standing” in black text. CPSA Companies that fail to satisfy Remediation requirements may be revoked, and CPSA Companies electing not to participate in Remediation when eligible will be revoked. Note: The Remediation Statement on the Website affirms the Council’s position on Remediation, and any external queries about a CPSA Company’s status will be directed to the CPSA Company in question. CPSA Companies in remediation may continue to perform PCI Card Production Assessments for which they are qualified by PCI SSC unless otherwise instructed by PCI SSC in connection with the Remediation process.

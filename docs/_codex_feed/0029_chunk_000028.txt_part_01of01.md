Background In June 2023, the Australian Government released its Strategic Plan for Australia’s Payments System , which outlined the key priorities and supporting initiatives for Australia's payments system. One of the five key priorities is promoting a safe and resilient payments system that protects end-users and safeguards their ability to transact safely and securely. This includes ensuring the payments industry is well-placed to protect against cyber-attacks and requiring the industry to continually uplift system-wide security standards and practices, including encryption methods for card payments systems. The Plan called for the cards payment industry to begin migration to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in 2025. This process requires the design, development, and delivery of an industry-wide program to migrate the Australian card payments system from Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES) to AES cryptography standards. The scope of this program includes: 55 issuers 25 acquirers domestic and international card schemes 970,000 payment terminals 25,200 ATMs. Neither physical cards nor digital wallets are impacted directly by this change. The role of AusPayNet AusPayNet is leading an industry-wide program to migrate the Australian card payments system to the AES. Australia is a leading jurisdiction in the global migration to the AES. The program is planned for completion in 2030/31, subject to any necessary regulatory approvals. Program updates The current focus for Phase 2a of the AES Migration Program in 2025 is on preparation for a pilot program to commence in 2026. > Read more In early May 2025, a webinar was delivered for Member insights on our program to upgrade the security of the card payments system. > Read more Phase 2a of the AES migration program has commenced, with a focus on pilot preparation activities ... > Read more The technical blueprint, migration strategy and industry testing strategy are progressing well and due to be finalised this month. > Read more Progress on Phase 1 (Initiation and Mobilisation) deliverables in 2024 for the program is tracking well, particularly in the Standards and Requirements, Migration Planning, and Industry Testing Working Groups. > Read more In April, the fifth Standards and Requirements Working Group meeting was held, where Members endorsed the latest version of the AES Technical Blueprint Handbook, representing the target state that could be used for migrating to AES. > Read more Contact If you have any questions in relation to our work on the AES Migration program, please contact the AES Migration Program Team .

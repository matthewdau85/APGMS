CEO’s corner Making it Happen Building on the last two AusPayNet Summits, it’s time to move beyond “paving the way” (2022) and “a turning point” (2023) to “making it happen”, this year’s theme. This year’s Summit on 12 December will be our largest ever and will again be emceed by one of Australia’s most experienced news presenters, Juanita Phillips. Highlights of the packed program include: An address by Assistant Governor and Deputy Chair of the Payments System Board of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), Dr Brad Jones Interviews with James Kelly, Head of Treasury’s Digital, Competition and Payments Division, and Maha El Dimachki, Centre Head of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub in Singapore Panels on cheques, security, and account-to-account (A2A) payments Our ever-popular Big Debate, this time on artificial intelligence (AI) in payments. The Assistant Governor’s address comes at an important time, given the first phase of the RBA’s review of retail payments regulation, as well as the tabling before Parliament of amendments to the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act , which underpins the RBA’s regulatory powers in payments, and when passed will enable the RBA to move onto the second phase of its review. Also timely – given 2025 is expected to see both the first tranche of payments licensing reform and an update to Government’s Strategic Plan for Australia's Payments System – is the interview with James Kelly. This will be followed by an interview with Maha El Dimachki who will talk to the BIS Innovation Hub’s groundbreaking global projects in payments, covering central bank digital currencies, economic crime, cybersecurity and AI. Our panels are where the payments industry is really making it happen. We will start with security in a quantum world, particularly relevant given the industry’s planned migration to the Advanced Encryption Standard to protect card data against the potential threat of quantum computing. We will then move onto the wind-down of the cheques system and hear various perspectives including from New Zealand – who closed their cheques system in 2021 – and State government, represented respectively by Steve Wiggins, Chief Executive of Payments NZ, and Lynne Cardwell, Executive Director, Banking and Financial Services, NSW Treasury. Representatives from the four key stakeholders in A2A payments – Treasury, RBA, Australian Payments Plus (AP+) and AusPayNet – will then discuss their future, following on from our announcement at last year’s Summit of a target end-date of 2030 – subject to further analysis of bulk payments – for the BECS framework. The grand finale will, as usual, be our Big Debate. This year, our two teams of debaters will wrangle over whether AI presents more threats or opportunities in payments. The debate will no doubt be lively, given the opportunities AI presents in terms of data analysis and fraud management, but the threats given its use by bad actors. Questions around the responsible use of AI and how it can be regulated and governed while fostering innovation will no doubt also be debated. An event like this is made possible through event partners and I’d like to thank: Thales, ACI Worldwide, Cuscal, Endava, Fitzgerald Jenkins Recruitment, MessageXchange, Monoova, Quest Payment Systems, Swift, and TNS. Overall, the team has put together another impressive agenda complemented by several opportunities to network at what is the last major payments event for 2024. I look forward to seeing you there. Cheques The Australian Government announced this week a move aimed at ensuring an orderly phase-out of cheques as part of a strategy to modernise Australia’s payments system. Under the Government’s Cheques Transition Plan, cheques will cease being issued by financial institutions by 30 June 2028 and cease being accepted by them on 30 September 2029. AusPayNet will lead an industry-wide transition coordination program, working with financial institutions in the lead-up to the closure of the cheques system. The program will be subject to an application for ACCC authorisation. Our work in coordinating the cheques transition program will include workstreams on overall migration management, migration of use cases, and clear and consistent industry communications. This work will assist in ensuring cheque users continue to be supported in the transition. Payments reforms AusPayNet continues to engage with regulators and Government stakeholders on the broad range of regulatory reforms affecting the payments industry, including the following consultations. The Scams Prevention Framework In early October, AusPayNet responded to Treasury’s consultation on the exposure draft legislation for establishing a national Scams Prevention Framework (SPF). The Scams Prevention Framework Bill was subsequently introduced to Parliament, on 7 November. Senate Committee Inquiry into the AML/CTF Amendment Bill Also in October, AusPayNet made a submission to the Senate Committee inquiry into the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) Amendment Bill 2024 . The Bill broadly aligned with the proposals in the Government’s preceding two consultations on reforms to the AML/CTF regime, as well as the key feedback provided in AusPayNet’s submissions to those consultations. Our submission to the inquiry therefore reiterated the feedback that AusPayNet, in consultation with our Policy Experts Group and other Members, provided to the Government on this topic in mid-2023 and mid-2024 . This included highlighting the industry’s strong support for amending the tipping-off offence to enable appropriate private-to-private information sharing across the ecosystem, and the importance of ensuring that the obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 do not impede the implementation of such information sharing arrangements.

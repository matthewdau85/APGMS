Headlining the event were RBA Governor, Michele Bullock, who made her first payments address since her appointment to the role, and the Hon Stephen Jones MP, who took part in a panel discussion on the role of regulation in the prevention of scams. We’ve prepared a highlights video to capture the essence of the day and would like to thank each of our speakers and valued event partners for making the Summit a resounding success. top Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) migration program update Following the AusPayNet Board’s approval to continue with Phase 1 (Initiation & Mobilisation) of this project, additional program-funded resources have been on-boarded to support delivery of this phase in 2024. Within the program: The Migration Planning Working Group (MPWG) met in February for the first time, focused on alignment of scope, objectives, and outcomes to deliver an AES Migration Strategy. The Standards & Requirements Working Group (SRWG) also met in February, focused on endorsement of the third interim release of the AES Technical Blueprint. A brief has been issued for a proposal to undertake: an assessment of industry testing requirements a definition of a strategy, including an approach and initial plan, for industry testing. top BECS update AusPayNet’s extensive three-year consultation on the strategic direction of the Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS, also known as Direct Entry) concluded in 2023. This consultation, which involved over 85 entities and included BECS Members as well as other relevant key stakeholders, identified that the payments industry supports a transition away from the BECS Framework to more modern payment systems. Although BECS has served the payments system well over the past 30 years, it lacks critical features that are becoming increasingly necessary and available through modern alternatives, namely: payee look-up and confirmation 24/7 clearing and settlement in near real-time data-rich messaging and monitoring with ISO compatibility. BECS Members also indicated no appetite to invest in addressing these limitations, given the significant and ongoing investment in the development and growth of more modern alternatives that are better suited to meet new and emerging needs of end-users and the Australian payments system. To help focus industry attention and effort, AusPayNet has communicated a target end-date of June 2030 for closing the BECS framework. This date was considered reasonable by the majority of BECS consultation participants but will be reviewed once Treasury has completed its detailed consultation on bulk payments with businesses and government, expected later this year. Retiring a significant legacy clearing system like BECS, that has traditionally been the payments workhorse for low-cost transactions, will not be without its challenges. AusPayNet is committed to ensuring that the industry’s transition away from the BECS framework is managed responsibly, with no disruption to the efficient and secure flow of direct entry payments. To this end, AusPayNet has commenced mobilisation activities to closely monitor the industry’s progress and the validity of the BECS framework’s target end-date. AusPayNet will continue to provide regular updates on the progress of this transition. top Cross-Border payments update In September 2023, the G20 New Delhi Leaders’ Declaration reaffirmed their commitment to the effective implementation of the prioritised actions for the next phase of the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-Border Payments to achieve the global targets for faster, cheaper, transparent and more inclusive cross-border payments by 2027. To assist them in taking forward the roadmap, both the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) continue working through their respective taskforces established in 2023. The CPMI’s Payments Interoperability and Extension (PIE) Taskforce has created four task teams that are focused on: Expanding payment system access and operating hours Promoting fast payment systems and their interlinking for cross-border payments Fostering ISO 20022 harmonisation Developing market intelligence and identifying supply side opportunities. The scope and timelines on the deliverables will be further refined, with the expectation that all task teams will have deliverables by the end of 2024. It should be noted that AusPayNet has already indicated that it will align its domestic high value ISO 20022 message-usage guidelines with the CPMI ISO 20022 data requirements for cross-border payments ahead of the end-2027 CPMI timeline for global adoption. This fully optimises the domestic HVCS and will help reduce inefficiencies along the cross-border payments chain. The FSB’s Legal, Regulatory, and Supervisory Matters (LRS) Taskforce continues its work, having last met in September 2023. The focus to date has been on reviewing proposed updates to the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF’s) Recommendation 16. The FSB is also undertaking work with regards to the interaction and potential constraints between data frameworks and cross-border payments. It was agreed that a dialogue with data privacy experts and authorities could also be beneficial to the FATF’s broader anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) work, going forward. The API Panel of Experts (APEX) Taskforce has commenced its work on looking at API standards and harmonising their usage for cross-border payments. We look forward to the publication of their work over the course of 2024. The recent publication of the FSB’s Annual Progress Report on Meeting the Targets for Cross-Border Payments shows that there is much work to be done and key challenges remain to close off data gaps. With key performance indicators (KPIs) now generally available, industry participants and jurisdictions will be able to start calibrating their responses to deliver on the global targets. The task is significant and resources are finite, but with annual KPIs and

The ATM Access Code was established in 2009 to provide an easy means for eligible new entrants to connect to the ATM system. In 2016, we initiated a review of the Code to ensure that it remains relevant to industry needs. This process has involved consulting with stakeholders and liaising closely with the Reserve Bank of Australia. As part of this process, participants shared their perspectives on future directions and innovation trends within the ATM industry. Responses to the Consultation paper were due by 24 October 2016. This work is ongoing with outcomes in anticipated in 2018.

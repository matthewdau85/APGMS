PCI forensic investigator (PFI) and the forensics investigation, including making the entity’s data, systems, components, and related services available for investigation. Additional considerations may include issues such as:  Steps expected of entities and/or TPSPs if data loss has occurred  Use of tools such as file recovery  Applicability and adequacy of insurance coverage  Responsibility for making notifications  Financial responsibility for notification costs  Notification timelines  Engagement of forensic investigators and responsibility for investigation costs  Clearly documenting the incident (involving cardholder data) response reporting requirements, including who is responsible for notifying the acquirer or card brands in case of a third-party incident 5.3.3 Post-termination Considerations Regarding TPSPs and their Customers Entities that (a) are subject to requirements regarding CHD or any CDE (whether driven by the PCI DSS, legal considerations, or otherwise) and (b) outsource related responsibilities to a TPSP, may also wish to consider how those requirements and responsibilities may apply to the TPSP after the entity–TPSP engagement has formally ended. For example, if a TPSP continues to store an entity’s CHD as part of an archival backup system, the TPSP’s corresponding obligations regarding such CHD may continue as well. As a result, the entity may wish to consider whether post-termination reporting, notice, data retention, or related requirements are appropriate and/or whether notice should be provided (even after the entity–TPSP relationship has ended) if and when the TPSP destroys or irreversibly removes data from its facilities and/or devices. Similar considerations arise in connection with terminated TPSP employees. If an individual may have access to the entity’s confidential information (including CHD or the CDE) while employed by the TPSP, 10 This reference is to PCI DSS v3.1 – April 2015 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 25 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 entities and TPSPs may wish to consider mechanisms to help ensure that such information is protected after the employment relationship ceases, such as:  Ongoing post-termination confidentiality obligations  Appropriate allocation of responsibility for ensuring compliance by TPSP employees with their ongoing confidentiality obligations  Appropriate allocation of responsibility for enforcement of confidentiality obligations, and for costs associated with enforcement and related legal proceeding in the event of a breach of those obligations  Termination of TPSP-employee access to buildings or systems immediately upon termination of employment 5.3.4 Outsourcing of Provided Functionality (Nested TPSPs) If the TPSP outsources to a separate contractor a portion of the services the TPSP has agreed to provide to the entity, all of the issues and concerns raised above would potentially also apply to the relationship between the TPSP and the outsourced contractor. This, in turn, may impact the scope of the entity’s CDE and ultimately the scope of the entity’s PCI DSS validation. As a result, to help manage these complexities and related risks, entities may wish to consider whether mechanisms such as the following may be appropriate:  Notification to the entity that outsourcing has occurred  The TPSP that has been initially engaged to provide services to the entity seeking PCI compliance should provide as part of the initial engagement documentation with information related to other third-party entities (for example, nested TPSPs) that will be engaged in supporting the entity.  Appropriate limitations regarding outsourcing of functionality, such as regional exclusions due to jurisdictional concerns  The entity seeking a TPSP for outsourcing of services that could impact the security of the cardholder data environment should establish documented procedures for the inclusion of clauses with detailed limitations and exclusions depending on the type of services to be outsourced and jurisdictional and regulatory compliance concerns (e.g., country-level data privacy laws, safe-harbor rulings, etc.), avoiding general liability statements and focusing more on the uniqueness of the inherent risks associated with the services to be outsourced.  Appropriate allocation of liability, responsibility and costs relating to actions of outsourced contractors and/or notifying the entity regarding incidents While an entity’s obligation to satisfy Requirement 12.8.411 extends only to monitoring and collecting evidence of the compliance status of its directly contracted TPSPs, the entity may also want to carefully review its TPSPs’ reliance on, and continuous oversight of, any nested TPSPs. 11 This reference is to PCI DSS v3.1 – April 2015 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

Accordingly, entities may wish to consider mechanisms intended to keep the entity apprised of changes in PCI DSS compliance status, and to appropriately allocate responsibility for loss of compliance status among the parties. Such mechanisms may include:  Disclosure/notice of changes in compliance status to the impacted entity  Remediation plans and procedures to re-establish compliance by set dates  Regular status meetings to advise on remediation efforts  Other appropriate measures intended to help ensure accountability and responsibility for non- compliance The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

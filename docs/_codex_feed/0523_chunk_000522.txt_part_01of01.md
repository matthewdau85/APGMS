with Regulations 4.15 to 4.19 inclusive and Regulation 11.11(d) Framework Participants are not responsible for any failure to conduct further exchanges of Items with the Declared Member or to perform other obligations arising from the exchange of Items with the Declared Member (excluding any such obligations under PART 12). (d) Where following an FCS Declaration a Framework Participant becomes a Declared Member, and exchanges with the Declared Member are suspended in APCS, the following provisions apply: (i) the Declared Member must comply with the requirements of Australian Prudential Standard 910 to the extent that it requires an Item drawn on another Framework Participant, which is deposited with the Declared Member but which is not settled, to be exchanged bilaterally. (ii) a Framework Participant which conducts such exchanges and which suffers any liability or loss as a result of such conduct has no recourse to the Company, or to any other Framework Participant (other than the Declared Member) under these Regulations or the Procedures, or under the regulations, procedures or manual for any other Clearing System with respect to that liability or loss. (iii) in this Regulation 11.11(d), “deposited” means provisionally credited to the depositing customer’s account. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Regulation 11.11(d) obliges a Declared Member to bilaterally exchange any Item lodged with it, but not provisionally credited to the depositing customer’s account, prior to the declaration. (e) Cheque Items drawn on the Declared Member which have been lodged with other Framework Participants but which have not been settled are taken to be dishonoured by operation of Section 70A(1) of the Cheques Act 1986 (Cth). Guidance note: Framework Participants should note that the deemed dishonour provisions of the Cheques Act: (i) apply to those cheques drawn on the Declared Member which are lodged, but which are unsettled, prior to the time of declaration. Presumptively, cheques drawn on the Declared Member which are lodged with another Framework Participant after the time of declaration may not be exchanged through APCS. Arrangements for the notification, that the cheque is unable to be exchanged, to depositing customers are proprietary; and (ii) are not taken to apply to any cheque drawn on a Declared Member which is either deposited to an account at the Declared Member or lodged with its Representative or its Appointor (as the case may be) as these Items are not cleared and settled through APCS. Australian Paper Clearing System (CS1) REGULATIONS PART 11 PROCEDURES Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 70 (f) To the extent it is legally able to do so, each Framework Participant must act in accordance with this PART 11, Part 8 of the EOD Balance Guidelines for SCV Calculation as that part applies to the remediation processing of Items and with any communications protocol approved by the Company for the purposes of this Regulation 11.11. (g) Except as expressly provided, this Regulation 11.11 does not apply to, and in no way affects, any rights or obligations arising under the regulations or the procedures or the manual for or in respect of the operations of any other Clearing System operated by, or under the auspices of, the Company. The next page is Part 12 Australian Paper Clearing System (CS1) REGULATIONS PART 12 FAILURE TO SETTLE Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 71 PART 12 FAILURE TO SETTLE 12.1 Explanatory Preamble (a) This PART 12 of the Regulations provides a set of failure to settle rules (“FTS Rules”) to deal with an FTS Event as defined in Regulation 12.3. (b) The FTS Rules apply only as between Tier 1 Framework Participants. Any settlement obligation which may exist between a Tier 2 Framework Participant and its Tier 1 Representative is a proprietary matter. The FTS Rules are silent on what might occur, either in the event a Tier 2 Framework Participant was unable to meet settlement obligations due to its Tier 1 Representative, or in the event a Tier 1 Framework Participant was unable to meet settlement obligations due to its Tier 2 Appointor. (c) The Company has published a set of FTS Guidelines to assist Framework Participants in preparing for and dealing with the occurrence of an FTS Event (or Potential FTS Event). Framework Participants should ensure that they have a continuing full understanding of the FTS Rules and the FTS Guidelines. The FTS Guidelines, which may be amended from time to time, can be found on the Company’s extranet. 12.2 Application of Part This PART 12 applies in connection with the occurrence of any FTS Event or Potential FTS Event. 12.3 FTS Event An FTS Event occurs where a Tier 1 Framework Participant fails to settle for the obligations incurred by it under: (a) these Regulations and the Procedures, or (b) the regulations and the procedures or manual for any other Clearing System which include provisions which: (i) govern the conduct of settlement when a member of that Clearing System (the “Clearing System Defaulter”) fails to settle its settlement obligations under that Clearing System, provided that with respect to the High Value Clearing System (CS4) (“HVCS”), at the time of such failure to settle, settlement of HVCS payments is prescribed to occur on a deferred net basis, and (ii) provide at least once on each business day for bilateral netting of settlement of amounts owed to or by that Clearing System Defaulter as a result of the exchange of payment

It is the responsibility of the company/candidate to ensure that the certifying body is accredited, and to provide evidence of accreditation to PCI SSC. To find out if your country has an accreditation body, visit the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) website at www.iaf.nu and use the IAF MLA signatories list to identify an accreditation body in your country or region. To find a certification body, visit the International Organization for Standardization certification information page; the section titled “Choosing a certification body” will explain how to find a certification body. Verification of company's certification should be addressed to the certification organization in question. You may also wish to contact the ISO member in your country or the country concerned, as they may have a national database of certified companies.

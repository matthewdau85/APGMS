we understand there are no shortcuts, even for the smallest businesses. We are dedicated to continuously updating our payroll software to incorporate features and functionalities that help you comply with the often demanding government regulations. We primarily focus on the Fair Work Ombudsman and Australian Taxation Office requirements to ensure compliant payroll processing and are ISO 27001 independently audited and certified. Our pricing plans accommodate the budgets of most businesses, and we offer additional functionality that can be purchased separately. We don’t provide a trial, as the first three employees are always 100% free with no hidden costs or conditions. 87 125 545 717 e-PayDay Go FREEPAY e-PayDay Pty Ltd Payroll (STP) Micro Y www.freepay.com.au We are thrilled to announce that we now offer free cloud-based Single Touch Payroll (STP) software for small businesses with up to three employees. We initially offered our e-PayDay Go FREEPAY® payroll plan to businesses with two employees, but due to our ongoing growth, we can now provide it to more businesses for free. Are you tired of searching for free payroll only to discover you're looking at trial payroll software? We are continually told about trying free payroll software only to discover it's a trial. Or, read that the payroll software is free but then discover the limitations are so restrictive that it is unusable. Our e-PayDay Go FREEPAY® payroll plan is 100% free for the first three employees. We also have plans that are suitable if you have more employees. There are no activation fees, monthly service fees, cost per pay period, or minimum term.

virtual technologies. Some of these considerations are: ▪ It is difficult to maintain up-to-date, secure configurations on virtual machines when they are being activated and deactivated in rapid cyclesvirtual machines that are dormant for any period of time may be improperly secured or may introduce security vulnerabilities when activated. ▪ Security and monitoring solutions for virtual networks are still evolving and are not as mature as those available for physical networks; for instance, continuous segmentation testing between the cloud tenants’ networks. Additionally, traditional security software and security device functions often do not scale well to a cloud environment. For example: ▪ Management of VM-to-VM traffic that does not pass through traditional network-based security controls may require the use of additional host-based security controls to monitor and control the traffic. ▪ Traditional agent-based software security solutions that are not designed for virtualized environments may cause operational issues. For example, software agents, such as those often used for anti-virus protection, each use a small percentage of memory and processing resources; this can result in a large overhead when multiple agents are installed on multiple VMs on the same host. ▪ Scheduled scans or updates occurring simultaneously across multiple VMs may result in an extreme load on the underlying system and reduce overall performance of all hosted VMs. E.2 Multi-tenancy In a multi-tenant cloud environment, Customers generally have no knowledge of the other Customers with whom they share resources (for example, virtual infrastructure, data stores, etc.), or how other Customers are securing (or not securing) their environments that access the shared resources. Provider should perform a segmentation testing in a multi-tenant environment to ensure that cloud tenants are isolated from each other (see Section 6.5.3.3, “Segmentation Testing,” for further information). Whether unsavory Customers can pose a risk to other Customers using the same Provider will largely depend on the controls the Provider has in place to segregate Customers from one another, and to Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

Before engaging with a Provider, Customers should consider how the Provider verifies that their Customers are who they say they are, and how the Provider detects potentially suspicious behavior once the Customers are on board. Customers should also ask the Provider what controls it has in place to ensure that the security posture of one Customer cannot affect the security posture of another Customer. E.3 Internet of Things and Fog Computing "Smart" devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, wearables, smart sensors and IoT devices are increasingly used to accept and process payments. While these devices rely on the cloud-based ecosystem, they often use fog computing ("fog") as a layer between themselves and the cloud back end.20 Fog computing or fog networking is an emerging architecture for computing, storage, control and networking that distributes these services closer to end-users along the cloud-to-things continuum.21 From an architectural standpoint, fog provides computing resources closer to the data-producing end- points at the edge. Devices in the fog computing (fog nodes) tend to be in a widely distributed deployment, with a very large number of nodes positioned for ingestion and processing of the data close to the source (i.e., IoT devices), providing interplay with the cloud back end. Fog computing can be seen as an extension of the traditional cloud-based computing architecture, service models and categories. As in cloud computing, fog nodes are deployed as private, community, public or hybrid nodes, supporting SaaS, PaaS and IaaS service categories. Therefore, principles and guidance in this document are applicable to IoT devices and fog computing ecosystems. E.4 Software Defined Networking Typically, a network’s structure and segmentation are defined with the use of network devices including firewalls and switches. SDN is the capability to abstract lower-level network functions by exposing the high-level capability through an API. SDN separates network activity into a control plane and a data plane, with the data plane directly performing data transport functions, and the control plane being a separate, central point for API calls to define the management of the data layer. SDNs are often used for micro-segmentation, which is the ability to define a point-to-point circuit between two nodes, preventing them from interacting with other systems, and preventing other systems from interacting with them, without an explicitly added policy. 20 Michaela Iorga, Larry Feldman, Robert Barton, Michael J.

The SDN Provider must maintain a separation of duties from the SDN consumer (whether an external Customer or a business unit within an organization), even if they are in the same organization, to ensure that the SDN Provider

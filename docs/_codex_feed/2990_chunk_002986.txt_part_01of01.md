secured? ▪ How is physical media inventoried, secured, monitored, and tracked? ▪ Is media reused? How is data permanently removed from end-of-life or reusable media? Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 58 PCI DSS Requirement Considerations for Cloud Environments Regularly Monitor and Test Networks Requirement 10: Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data. Requirement 11: Regularly test security systems and processes. ▪ How are activities traced back to individual Customer personnel or individual Provider personnel? ▪ Can the specific system components used by a Customer at a particular time be identified? ▪ What types of events are recorded in audit logs? ▪ How are audit logs correlated between Customer environments (such as a VM image) and Provider infrastructure (such as the hypervisor or underlying system)? ▪ How are audit logs monitored and reviewed? ▪ How are clocks synchronized between virtual instances and underlying systems/hardware? ▪ How is testing for wireless technologies performed and managed? ▪ How are all variations of VM images (including inactive VMs) scanned for vulnerabilities? ▪ What defenses are in place to protect against internal attacks (originating from Provider’s or other Customer network) and external attacks (originating from the internet or other public network)? ▪ Is penetration testing performed across different layers of the environment (e.g., between VMs and the Provider’s management network, or between Customers on shared infrastructure)? ▪ How is security testing managed for Provider infrastructure vs. Customer environments? o What testing are Customers allowed to perform on their internet-facing systems? o How are Customers prevented from performing penetration testing on other Customers’ environments?

Appendix A1: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Shared Hosting Providers ▪ How is isolation maintained across different layers, including between virtual machines, physical machines, networks, storage systems (e.g., storage area networks), management networks and support systems? ▪ What controls are in place to prevent data leakage between Customers, and between Customer and Provider? ▪ Are resource-isolation mechanisms in place?

E.1 Evolving Security Technologies As mentioned above, virtualization security considerations will also apply to cloud environments. There are many industry resourcesincluding the "PCI DSS Virtualization Guidelines," available from the PCI SSC websitethat discuss security considerations for the use of virtual technologies. Some of these considerations are: ▪ It is difficult to maintain up-to-date, secure configurations on virtual machines when they are being activated and deactivated in rapid cyclesvirtual machines that are dormant for any period of time may be improperly secured or may introduce security vulnerabilities when activated. ▪ Security and monitoring solutions for virtual networks are still evolving and are not as mature as those available for physical networks; for instance, continuous segmentation testing between the cloud tenants’ networks. Additionally, traditional security software and security device functions often do not scale well to a cloud environment. For example: ▪ Management of VM-to-VM traffic that does not pass through traditional network-based security controls may require the use of additional host-based security controls to monitor and control the traffic. ▪ Traditional agent-based software security solutions that are not designed for virtualized environments may cause operational issues. For example, software agents,

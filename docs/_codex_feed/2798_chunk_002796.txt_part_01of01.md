and that there are no restrictions regarding which TPSPs can be used. In some cases an acquirer or payment card brand may disallow the engagement of TPSPs due to risk that has already been previously identifed 3.2.2 Third-Party Service Provider Validation Documentation The entity may also consider requesting validation documentation from the TPSP that demonstrates the TPSP has achieved PCI DSS compliance. How and whether a TPSP must validate PCI DSS compliance is defined by the payment card brands, and required validation documentation may vary. This, in turn, impacts the types of compliance documentation an entity can expect to receive from the TPSP. Refer to the payment card brands’ websites for more information about specific brand compliance programs, or contact the payment card brands directly. The level of documentation should be commensurate with the level of risk and impact the TPSP presents to the entity’s PCI DSS compliance. The documentation should be sufficient to confirm that the services provided are covered by the TPSP’s PCI DSS assessment, and identify the PCI DSS requirements that were assessed to be in place. The documentation should also include information related to any services provided by the TPSP in other countries. Accordingly, an entity that is required to validate its compliance through a full onsite assessment can rely on the self-assessed validation of its TPSP—if that TPSP is eligible to self-assess and if this is in line with the organization’s risk management position and the applicable payment brand compliance programs. As part of the due diligence process, the following documentation, as applicable, may be obtained from TPSPs that have been validated as PCI DSS compliant. The list also contains recommendations for reviewing validation documentation that may be provided to the entity. Validation documentation being provided to the entity should cover the service(s) being delivered by the TPSP to the entity to help ensure the services provided are covered by the TPSP’s compliance validation:  Report on Compliance (ROC): Completed by either an Internal Security Assessor (ISA) or by an external Qualified Security Assessor (QSA). Relevant sections of the ROC may be sufficient to demonstrate the scope of a PCI DSS assessment and compliance status. This may be unnecessary if the AOC covers the required services.  If compensating controls are used, determine why the original requirement could not be met; understand what the control is, how it is meeting the intent and rigor of the original requirement, and how the control is being maintained. Note: It is possible that a TPSP may choose not to share certain aspects or any portion of its ROC if sensitive information is included or where releasing the document may compromise confidentiality. Alternative information may include a redacted ROC to protect any confidential information, a remote 3 Payment card brand contact information can be found on the PCI SSC website: https://pcissc.secure.force.com/faq/articles/Frequently_Asked_Question/How-do-I-contact-the-payment-card-brands The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 10 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 session where sensitive information can be reviewed when required, or a face-to face meeting to allow for viewing of the documentation. Additionally, many QSAs provide a letter on company letterhead, which may be used if the TPSP does not want to share potentially confidential information contained in its ROC.  Attestation of Compliance (AOC): Fully executed “Attestation of Compliance for Onsite Assessments – Service Providers”4 may be provided to the entity upon request. Template and information to complete the document can be found on the PCI SSC website.  Examine the name and type of services assessed found in Section 2A, “Scope Verification,” to validate the services provided by the TPSP are covered. Examples are “Hosting Provider” and “Payment Processing.”  Review relationships with other TPSPs to understand whether there are any additional services that may need evaluation or inclusion.  Review the AOC to determine whether the TPSP has requirements that are non-compliant that should be covered by the services provided.  Careful review of Part 2G, ”Summary of Requirements Tested,” is warranted as it contains those PCI DSS requirements the TPSP has fully tested, partially tested, or not tested for each service provided. For any “Partial” or “None” responses, the entity should review to ensure the services provided are covered. If the service provided was not covered by this assessment, the entity may wish to include this in its PCI DSS assessment. Note that PCI DSS requires the assessed entity to maintain information about which PCI DSS requirements are managed by each service provider, and which are managed by the entity (Requirement 12.8.54). Please be aware, however, that PCI DSS does not require the TPSP to account for all PCI DSS requirements (for example, using a compliance matrix for all its customers).  Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) D and Attestation of Compliance for Service Providers (AOC): Completed by TPSP if completing a self-assessment. These documents can be found on the PCI SSC website.  Careful review of Part 2G, ”Summary of Requirements Tested,”4 is warranted as it contains those PCI DSS requirements the TPSP has fully tested, partially tested, or not tested for each service provided. For any “Partial” or “None” responses, the entity should review to ensure the services provided are covered. If the service provided was not covered by this assessment, the entity may wish to include this in its PCI DSS assessment.

occurred in the context of significant developments in fast retail payment systems internationally. The PSB foresaw that, in the absence of collaborative efforts by the payments industry, the retail payment services offered in Australia were at risk of falling behind those available in other countries (Richards 2014). Although in some countries – including Japan, Korea, Mexico and Switzerland – fast payment capabilities for retail payments have existed for years, more recently technological advancements have led to numerous countries further developing their services or launching faster retail payments systems (Bolt, Emery and Harrigan (2014) and CPMI (2016)). NPP and FSS projects The development of the NPP involved extensive cooperation between ADIs to build the capability to send and receive individual payment messages between themselves, as well as settlement instructions to the Reserve Bank's FSS, in real time. Additionally, the project required ADIs to upgrade their internal systems to allow posting to customer accounts within a few seconds. The enhanced capability of the NPP also meant that participating financial institutions initiated large internal projects to upgrade their payments processing and monitoring systems, as well as customer-facing internet banking systems and mobile device applications. Given the significant effort required both across and within ADIs, the NPP program took place over a number of phases. The first two phases began in June 2013 and focused on program planning, the development of business requirements, and sourcing of service providers. The third phase, which started in December 2014, involved the detailed design of the infrastructure along with the development of the operating procedures, industry test strategy and overall industry RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA BULLETIN – SEPTEMBER 2018 3 implementation plan. The fourth phase, which commenced in August 2015, involved the build and configuration of the core elements of the NPP infrastructure, including the NPP network, the switching capability (which co-ordinates and facilitates the movement of messages across the NPP network) and the addressing service. Following these phases, there was then a staged period of testing for both the new NPP infrastructure and ADIs' own internal system enhancements. The FSS was developed by the Reserve Bank in parallel with the NPP. The FSS enables final and irrevocable settlement of individual NPP transactions in real time. Leveraging the approach employed by some stock exchanges, the FSS employs in-memory processing to enable fast settlement-processing times, with a median settlement-processing time since launch of around 50 milliseconds. The design, build, testing and implementation of the FSS involved the cumulative efforts of Reserve Bank staff across multiple departments. As well as work related to the payment system infrastructure, changes needed to be implemented to support the introduction of 24/7 shift work (as the functioning of the FSS is monitored continuously) and to upgrade general building infrastructure to support continuous system operations. The Bank worked with participant institutions to enable appropriate liquidity mechanisms to facilitate settlement of the anticipated transaction values in the FSS overnight and on weekends when the cash market is closed.[2] As well as providing the FSS, the Reserve Bank also engaged in a separate project in its Banking Department – which provides transactional banking services to a number of government agencies – to construct the infrastructure and systems required to support its role as an NPP participant. The Bank's participation in the NPP enables government agencies to provide enhanced payments services to their customers, such as for emergency benefit payments made by the Department of Human Services. The NPP and FSS went live for use between participant institutions on 27 November 2017. At this time, there was a period of ‘live proving’ where a small number of real transactions were processed to verify participants' various end-to-end payments-related systems and processes in a production environment. Following this final live-proving phase, the NPP was officially launched to the public on 13 February 2018, making fast payment services available to customers of around 50 participating financial institutions on the day of launch. RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA BULLETIN – SEPTEMBER 2018 4 Overview of the Infrastructure The introduction of real-time payments in Australia was enabled through the development of two new payments system infrastructures – the NPP Basic Infrastructure and the FSS. This section outlines the key components and architecture of the NPP and FSS, as illustrated in Figure 1. NPP Basic Infrastructure The NPP Basic Infrastructure is the industry utility owned and operated by NPPA, which provides the core capabilities required for fast and flexible payment messaging. It uses the ISO 20022 international messaging standard, which is a global standard for financial messaging that is flexible and extensible, and therefore enables the sending of richer and more complete remittance information with a payment. The NPP Basic Infrastructure is operated by SWIFT under a contract with NPPA and includes three key components: • a new domestic SWIFT network that provides fast connectivity and facilitates payment message flows between infrastructure components, including clearing messages between participating ADIs and settlement messages between these institutions and the FSS • decentralised switching via payment gateways that route messages across the network. These payment gateways are located within participating ADIs' data centres and each ADI is directly responsible for the speed and capacity of their infrastructure. ADIs are also responsible for their own fraud monitoring • the addressing service, which enables customers, through their financial institution, to link their transaction account to a simple unique identifier called a PayID, such as an email address, phone number or ABN.

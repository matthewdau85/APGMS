STANDARD INTERCHANGE SPECIFICATION Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 36 STANDARD INTERCHANGE SPECIFICATION A.1 Standard Interchange (a) This Annexure A sets out the interchange specifications required to be met by all IA Participants, to the extent applicable to the capacities in which they participate (or are deemed to participate) in Interchange. (b) Although it is not necessary that all Interchanges engaged in by IA Participants and Non-Members conform to this specification, it is a requirement that all IA Participants are capable of supporting this interface and it is to be used where bilateral agreement cannot be reached. (c) As this specification is taken from the previous version of the CECS Manual (in force until 30 June 2015) it contains elements that are unnecessary for an ATM only interchange. These elements have been retained as a transition measure only. A.2 Purpose The purpose of this Annexure A is to define the standard message set capable of supporting the range of Interchange Transactions arising from Card-originated, debit Transactions and associated interactive message traffic between IA Participants. A.3 Scope (a) The scope of this Annexure A is to specify IAC requirements for debit authorisation Interchange in sufficient detail to allow construction and implementation of the required interface (see also Part 2). (b) The message specifications given in this Annexure A are based on the Australian Standard, AS2805 Electronic funds transfer - Requirements for interfaces. The requirements of this specification take precedence over those of the AS2805 standard if any contention arises during the implementation of an interface using this specification. A.4 References The following documents are referred to in this Annexure A: (a) AS2805.2-2007/Amdt 2-2008 Electronic funds transfer - Requirements for interfaces Part 2: Message structure, format and content (b) AS2805.4.1-2001/Amdt 1/2006 Electronic funds transfer - Requirements for interfaces Part 4.1: Message authentication - Mechanism using a block cipher (c) AS2805.6.3-2000/Amdt 1/2003 Electronic funds transfer - Requirements for interfaces Part 6.3: Key management - Session Keys - Node to node IAC CODE SET VOLUME 6 – ATM SYSTEM CODE ANNEXURE A.

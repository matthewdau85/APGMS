onto paper travelling over an anvil. An alternative method moves the anvil against the numbering box. Various configurations of this equipment exist and their effectiveness is dependent on the amount of force used. Some equipment has limited force for the transfer and this can result in poor quality MICR due to incomplete transfer to the paper or flaking of the MICR characters during normal document handling. 4.2.3 Proof Encoder Printers These are usually small, low speed, units with a single row of raised E-13B characters around a narrow drum. The drum is mounted on a rotating axle whose orientation is moved in response to keyboard strokes from the proof-machine operator. The drum presses a narrow ribbon against the document being processed, thus generating the required MICR characters. Because of the lightweight construction and heavy use, this process is often the cause of poor quality MICR encoding. 4.2.4 Thermal Ribbon Encoding Thermal encoding has only been used on proof machines and the process is the same as that commonly used for generating bar codes except that the ribbon used contains a high level of iron oxide. The thermal printhead is made up of a fine matrix of heating elements that can be selectively heated to create the shape of the required characters. This head is in contact with the ribbon and paper so that when the elements in the printhead are heated, the ribbon material is melted and transferred to the paper. 4.2.5 Ribbon Materials The ribbon material is based on a thin plastic film carrier, usually Mylar, covered with a wax based coating. This coating contains sufficient iron oxide to make it magnetisable plus a number of resins and modifiers to ensure clean, even transfer of the coating when the appropriate force is applied. This coating requires more pressure to transfer to the paper than wet ink used in letterpress printing and depends more on physical force and paper surface attraction than penetration into the paper. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 31 AusPayNet September 2017 Adequate adhesion of all encoded characters is essential to prevent abrasion during processing or fraudulent alteration. This is best obtained by the use of high impact equipment to ensure the characters become firmly attached to the fibrous surface of the paper. This is sometimes augmented by a fusion process using high-intensity light from Xenon lamps. Other problems that can arise with this technology are filling in of characters and extraneous ink transferring from the ribbon due to an unduly soft ribbon composition. Conversely, a dry ribbon may result in partial transfer of the ribbon, creating voids. Excessive force may lead to debossment but this is preferable to the use of lower impact forces resulting in flaking of the MICR characters during normal document handling. Type defects such as nicks, low spots, and rounded edges on the drum or non-uniform hammer or anvil surfaces can also cause voids or ragged edges on the MICR characters. It is most important that the care, storage and shelf life instructions provided by MICR ribbon manufacturers are always followed. Prolonged exposure of ribbons to high temperatures and humidity can reduce the ribbon's life and impair the print quality. Rough handling causes ribbon coating transfer to the underside of the ribbons thus destroying their effectiveness. It is imperative to ensure that the ribbon is a MICR ribbon by testing each batch to ensure that it meets signal strength requirements. 4.3 Non-impact MICR printing The term non-impact is used in this context to differentiate this group of technologies from ribbon encoding which requires some form of mechanical force to transfer material from a ribbon to the paper form. The term embraces, but is not limited to such technologies as Laser, LED, Electron Beam Imaging and Magnetography. These technologies all have in common the use of a dry powder, or MICR toner, which is selectively transferred to paper to form an image. This toner contains iron oxide in sufficient quantity to make the print magnetisable to the required level to meet the signal level requirements. The character shape and dimensions may vary slightly from the ideal illustrated within this Standard as toner is deposited in a different manner from ink or ribbon, but only to the extent of the tolerances specified for each of the fourteen E-13B MICR characters (refer to Appendix 2). This has required considerable work to optimise the character dimensions to gain the best result over the range of reader/sorters in use. Users must not change the E-13B font supplied with the system, or alter it in any way, as this will invalidate any guarantee or accreditation that comes with the system. If choosing to in-fill cheque documents using a non-impact method it is suggested that a paper with toner enhanced, or frangible toner enhanced, features be considered. Consult with your security printer or refer to the AusPayNet Paper Register for suitable paper stocks.

This was necessary because of the large number of new high-volume non-impact MICR printers that are being sold in Australia. The large volumes of MICR documents that these systems can potentially supply could cause adverse effects on the clearing system if

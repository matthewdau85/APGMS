PCI Security Standards Council Bulletin: Updates to the Qualified Integrator and Reseller (QIR) Program 31 March 2023 Following the retirement of the Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA-DSS) and Program last year, the Qualified Integrator and Reseller (QIR) Program has been updated to align with the introduction of the PCI Software Security Framework Program. Changes to the new QIR program include: • Adding PCI-listed software, validated by the PCI Secure Software program, to the PCI Validated Payment Software that QIRs must install according to guidance provided by the vendor. • Indicating that any listed PA-DSS validated software installed will be acceptable only for pre- existing deployments. Updates have been made to the QIR Qualification Requirements, QIR Program Guide, Implementation Statement, and Implementation Instructions with these changes. These changes are effective immediately. The updated QIR Program documents are now available in the PCI SSC Document Library. Updates to the QIR training are forthcoming and will be communicated when available. ###

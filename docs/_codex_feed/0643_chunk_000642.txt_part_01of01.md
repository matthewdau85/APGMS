Figure 3.2. 1 – PIN encryption points during PIN and PAN Internet banking registration. (Example Architecture) Risk and security17 Customer PIN and PAN registration should only be performed using an Issuer approved device (see clause 3.6) and functionality, and should follow the recommendations set out below:18 PIN usage should adhere to the principles set out in ISO 9564 (all parts) to the maximum extent possible consistent with the Issuer's security and risk management policies;19 the plain text PIN should never be transmitted over communications lines outside of a secure environment as specified in AS 2805.14.2:2009, clause H.5; PIN and PAN registration should ensure that the plain text PIN is never known to, or accessible by, any employee or agent of the Issuer;20 a detailed risk assessment paying particular attention to any deviations from the relevant standards – [AS 2805.14, ISO 9564, ISO 13491] - should be an integral part of any Issuer’s decision to provide functionality in support of PIN and PAN registration over open networks; and21 16 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 17 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 18 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 19 Amended effective 21/11/16, version 004 r&p 002.16 20 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 21 Amended effective 21/11/16, version 004 r&p 002.16 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 3 PIN USAGE OVER OPEN NETWORKS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 12 to assist with fraud monitoring and problem resolution, Issuers should record PIN and PAN registration events including date, time, frequency and the channel over which the event occurred (without recording any PINs). Cardholder authentication 22 Issuers should: provide Cardholders with a means to determine that the dialogue with the Issuer is genuine; use calling-line identification only as a confirmation, not proof, of a Cardholder's identity, and to implement additional Cardholder authentication; ensure that PIN and PAN registration systems over open networks provide mutual assurance to the Issuer and Cardholder that they are both genuine e.g., using a separate channel to deliver acknowledgements; acknowledge PIN and PAN registration events back to the Cardholder using an out-of-band mechanism i.e., through the use of two separate networks working simultaneously to authenticate a Cardholder; pay particular attention to device convergence resulting from technological change in selecting acceptable out-of-band mechanisms e.g., browser capable smartphones; and provide Cardholders with the means to confirm the outcome of a PIN and PAN registration event. 3.3 Recommendations for PIN change and delivery over open networks23 Preferred model24 The following principles should be applied to any PIN change and delivery system over open networks (e.g., Internet, mobile phone etc.): The PIN change and delivery system should be separate to all other PIN processing and card management systems. Its domain should contain no Cardholder identifying/authentication information other than that associated with the PIN change and delivery system itself; The identification and authentication credentials for the PIN change and delivery system should be communicated to the Cardholder using a totally separate out-of-band channel 25 from that used by the Cardholder to initiate 22 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 23 Last amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 24 Last amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 25 Out-of-band authentication requires a separate, discrete pathway, such as a telecommunications network, be used in the authentication process. This provides a second secure channel in the event the primary Internet channel is compromised. An attacker would have to exploit both the Internet channel and the secondary one -- the phone network or end-user device -- to launch a successful attack.

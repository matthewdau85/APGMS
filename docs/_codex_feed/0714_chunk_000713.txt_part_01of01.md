the EMV protocol as defined in Book 3 of the EMV specifications for transaction type “cash”. For Balance Inquiry, and for Transfer and Deposit Transactions, (if supported), the ATM must adhere to the recommendations contained in the EMVCo document "Recommendations for EMV Processing for Industry-Specific Transaction Types". Other Transactions types e.g., bill payment and top up are to be defined and processed as Purchase Transactions. 79 Inserted effective 1/1/16, version 002 r&p 002.15 80 Amended effective 21/11/17, version 006 r&p 002.17 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 6 – ATM SYSTEM CODE ANNEXURE G. EMV@ATM TERMINAL STANDARDS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 103 G.4 Terminal Processing ICC precedence ATM Transaction initiation must ensure that where Cards contain both a chip and a magnetic stripe, the chip is given precedence. If a magnetic stripe is read that includes either of the service codes 2xx or 6xx the Cardholder must be requested to insert the Card into the ICC reader and the ATM must not proceed with the Transaction, until such an action has occurred. Where the ATM contains a motorised, combined magnetic-stripe and ICC reader the ATM must give precedence to the ICC, if present. Where the Cardholder payment device contains both a contact and contactless interface the Cardholder may choose either of these interfaces without precedence subject to the ATM ensuring that any re-presentation of the Card is through an ICC interface. Application name display For contact Transactions, if the ATM supports the ability to allow the Cardholder to select an application or to confirm the application proposed by the Terminal, when the ATM displays an application to the Cardholder, it shall display:81 (a) the Application Preferred Name (Tag 9F12), if present and if the Issuer Code Table Index (Tag 9F11) indicating the part of ISO/IEC 8859 to use is present and supported by the Terminal (as indicated in Additional Terminal Capabilities); and (b) otherwise the Application Label, if present, by using the common character set of ISO/IEC 8859 (see EMV Book 4 Annex B).82 Candidate list filtering When the Terminal offers application selection to the Cardholder and where such configuration is viable (e.g. the device has the capability to support this feature), then, prior to displaying the candidate list to the Cardholder, the Terminal shall look for any matching applications that contain the eftpos RID A000000384.83 If found, then the candidate list will be further examined and any applications matching the AIDs identified in Table G.4.3 shall be removed from the list prior to its presentation to the Cardholder.

For multiple application Cards used in a contact interface:85 (a) when the Terminal offers application selection to Cardholders, then the candidate list containing all mutually supported applications should be presented to the Cardholder and the Cardholder selected application shall be used for the Transaction; or86 (b) when the Terminal does not offer application selection, the Terminal automatically selects the highest priority application on the Card. 87 For multiple application Cards used in a contactless interface, the Terminal automatically selects the highest priority application on the Card .88 Account selection (a) Australian IC Cards (single application) – auto application selection89 For contact Transactions, Account selection is required for all single application Australian IC Cards.

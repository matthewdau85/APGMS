Division 3 of Part 2 of Chapter 2 of the Legislation Act 2003 permits the First Parliamentary Counsel to make certain editorial and presentational changes to an Act or instrument in preparing a compilation for registration. The kinds of editorial changes that can be made include typographical and clerical errors; grammatical and spelling errors, and errors of punctuation; errors in numbering, cross referencing and alphabetical ordering; errors in references to laws or instruments, or provisions of such laws, errors in or arising out of an amendment of an Act or instrument and any other errors of a similar nature. The editorial power cannot be used to change the effect of the law, to resolve an ambiguity in the law or to rewrite legislation. This page contains the reports that detail the use of these editorial powers. The current report is a running record of editorial changes made during the current 6 month period and is updated when an editorial change is made. The finalised reports for previous periods also appear below. Current report Finalised reports

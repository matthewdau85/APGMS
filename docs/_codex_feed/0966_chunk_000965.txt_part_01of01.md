evening before the next day on a circuit. So, we collect some data during the day about our tire model or whatever it is that we're trying to answer. And then that evening we run those machine-learning models with all of the inputs that we've collected through the day in order to try and foresee what the race might look like, to have a lot of variability in strategies that others might try to do, in pit stop windows, in how the tires might change. So, we run, you know, this magnitude of simulations in order to hone in on what we believe is the right answer, the most likely way the race will go. That happens quite regularly on a Friday or Saturday night when the race is due to take place on Sunday morning. We're now at a point where teams can continue to run those models through the race. So, every lap of the race, the unknowns are reduced because you've got a better read on how others are performing or what tires they have remaining, for example. And now, lap on lap, we're able to complete those simulations again and again and again. And that has given us more and more information about how the remainder of the race might look. And that's very, very valuable to what we can do. I think from my own experience, there was a race that we completed in 2020 in Barion. It was the only race that I've won as a race strategist. And, on a Saturday night, through running the machine-learning models, through looking at lots and lots of different possibilities of what might happen, we knew that the tire we were starting the race on, because of a regulation, was not actually what we would do if we had total freedom. So, normally you'd restrict yourself to only looking at what you could do legally. But, in this case, we looked at all of the possibilities of what we could do. So, we had a multitude of answers of which tire we thought was best. We had an accident on lap one, which forced us to do a pit stop. But because we'd done the work on all of the other strategies that were possible out there, we knew that we should switch to a different type of tire. And that allowed us, along with a few other external events, to go on and make some good decisions that got us in the position to win that race, which we were not really expected to do from the outside. So, I think this ability to go through and prepare for situations that if you were just doing it manually or in a slower way, you wouldn't necessarily have the time to do and look at lots and lots of different environmental effects, which really, really helps as a strategist on the pit wall. Alicia Malone: It's amazing how much goes into your strategy and your planning for these races. I'm just so fascinated by what you've just mentioned and it's incredible how the use of AI has really helped transform industries like yours. Well, we're very excited to see you on stage this fall as our keynote speaker at our Europe Community Meeting in Amsterdam. Without giving away your keynote, can you give us a little sneak peek at what we might expect to hear from you? What do you want audiences to take away from your presentation? Bernie Collins: Yeah, so I think that like everyone in the room probably takes away something different, but the idea for me is people take away two or three tangible things that they can change, whether that be in their department, within their company, within their daily lives, whatever it might be. I think some of it we've touched on already. You know, for me, a key thing of F1 strategy is preparation and we take that to the next level. So, I want to sort of emphasize and get that across to people. And I want to use the strategy example, but I want to use more simple examples as well in order that they can then take that and repeat that to their groups or their colleagues or whatever the case may be. The other big passion of mine is analysis and how we look at our performance, how we ensure we're getting the best out of ourselves and others in a way that continues the group to grow, continues the team to grow. So hopefully we can touch on a few of those things. And we'll always do it from this standpoint of looking at from the strategist and the pit wall. But looking at a much more simple example, you know, probably we'll look at a pit stop, and we'll say, how does it work in a pit stop? And if we can do it in that environment, then we can certainly apply it to many, many other industries. Alicia Malone: Well, I am so excited to hear your keynote. I think this is going to be so fascinating. And since you are on Coffee with the Council , we like to ask our guests how they take their coffee. Or, if you're not a coffee drinker, what do you prefer instead? Bernie Collins: This is a very easy one for me because I am not a

who have submitted test results of their cheque and deposit form grade papers that conform to AusPayNet’s specifications, which are detailed in the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Technical Specifications, Section 6 - Paper for MICR encoded documents. Amended, effective 19/05/08 The list is available from AusPayNet’s website: www.auspaynet.com.au. The type of paper selected for cheques, deposit forms or summary slips must meet all of AusPayNet’s specifications detailed in the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Technical Specifications, Section 6 - Paper for MICR encoded documents. The relevant Financial Institutions may request proof of conformance to the specifications if the paper selected is not listed on the register. Amended, effective 19/05/08 Paper suppliers/manufacturers wishing to have their cheque and/or deposit form grade paper included on the register should contact AusPayNet for more information. Carbonless paper is preferred to spot carbonising as the latter causes problems with image processing. However, chemical coatings used for carbonless paper may be abrasive (CF Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 52 AusPayNet September 2017 type), or not able to give a sufficiently dark image (scan readable), use of this material must be discussed with the relevant Financial Institution. 7.6 Storage of Paper and the Effects of Moisture on the Permanence of Non-Impact Printing Inserted, effective 22/03/2006 If printing by laser printer (or similar technology) then:  The moisture content of the paper will affect the level of toner adhesion and thus permanence;  Printing on paper with moisture content above 5.5% will have reduced toner adhesion, which may mean that the printing does not have an acceptable level of permanence;  Maximum toner adhesion and permanence is achieved when the moisture content of paper is maintained during all stages of production at 4.5 – 5.5%; and  Therefore, paper should be stored in a moisture proof wrapper at all times prior to printing, and sufficient time allowed for conditioning of the stock if it is moved between environments prior to printing. Paper will gain or lose moisture depending on the relative humidity of the air if it is not kept in a moisture proof wrapper prior to printing. Appendix A Measurement of Print for Image Capture When a printed document is presented in an Imaging system, the system needs to discriminate between the information that is to be read, interpreted, or saved, and the rest of the print. This is achieved by printing the essential information in a dark colour and printing the detail that is not required in a lighter colour. The system can then have its contrast adjusted so that it only detects the darker print. For the documents to be read at high speed, it is necessary to specify the levels of darkness or lightness of colour and a way that these can be measured. There are two measurement systems available, Print Contrast Signal (PCS) and the more recent Dynamic Contrast Ratio (DCR) system. PCS values are acceptable for all areas of a document but DCR values are an acceptable alternative for measuring for the designated Areas Of Interest. Print Contrast Signal The initial method developed for specifying level of darkness or lightness of print is known as Print Contrast Signal (PCS), where the level of “darkness” of a colour is determined by its reflectance relative to the paper on which it is printed. This is expressed on a scale of zero to one. A dark colour has a low reflectance relative to the paper it is printed on, to which the PCS method gives a high value. A light colour has a high reflectance and has a low PCS value. To achieve reliable performance from the imaging equipment, it has been determined that information that is to be retained must be printed so that the print has a PCS value of 0.6 or more. This is termed scan readable. Information that is not to be retained must be printed so that the PCS value is 0.3 or less, and this is termed scan non-readable. The gap between the PCS value for scan readable and scan non-readable is to improve the performance of the equipment. Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 53 AusPayNet September 2017 The value of the PCS is determined by measuring the reflectance of the paper, or background, and the area whose PCS is being determined. A mathematical formula is then used to calculate the PCS, or the instrument used may carry out the calculation automatically. The detail on how the PCS value is calculated and measured is described in Appendix B. DCR Compared to PCS A more refined method of measuring the level of lightness and darkness of print is “Dynamic Contrast Ratio” or DCR. Both DCR and PCS are a measure of contrast and the mathematical formula is the same. They differ in definition of the terms and the way that each is applied. In DCR, “background” is the average of all pixels in a 0.125 inch square area. As in all computerised scanning, no discrimination of background and foreground is made and this is an overall average, which includes the centre pixel. In PCS a human selection of the background and foreground is made, and a manual sampling is taken to establish average reflectance values for both. This limits the value of PCS when evaluating complex patterns, as arbitrary sampling may give different

entity’s PCI DSS scope. 6.1.2 Maintaining an Inventory of Third-Party Service Providers Define the procedures to maintain an inventory of all TPSPs, including the information elements deemed critical. The following are suggested elements that may be included in the inventory:  Name and primary points of contact at the TPSP  Specific service(s) being provided  If cardholder data is shared, what elements are shared (sensitive authentication data, PAN, expiry, etc.)  Location of the data—is the data stored internally in the organization, by the third party in one of its locations, or by an external hosting provider  What system components are included in the review  TPSP risk-assessment results  Frequency of monitoring cycle  Last date of review  Contract renewal/expiry  Documentation/evidence required  Any nested TPSPs leveraged to provide the services  Any third-party payment applications used to provide the services  Volume of cardholder data that is stored/processed/transmitted/impacted by the TPSP  Logical access to the entity’s network  Any designations the TPSP holds that support its PCI DSS compliance attestation (ISO, PCI QIR, PCI PTS, FIPS 140, etc.) 6.1.3 Third-party Service Provider Monitoring Procedure Below is a high-level description of the components an entity may wish to consider including in its TPSP monitoring procedure. The list is not exhaustive and is not intended to define the only method to monitor TPSPs’ PCI DSS compliance status; however, the list describes some recommended components that may be included in the procedure. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 29 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 6.1.3.1 Documentation/Evidence Define the evidence and supporting documentation that will be collected from TPSPs for analysis and retention. As specified earlier, a key piece of information to be gathered is the role of the TPSP in the CDE. This information may be available from the applicable sections of the ROC or Part 2E, Description of Environment in the AOC. See Section 3.2.2, “Third-Party Service Provider Validation Documentation,” for additional information. 6.1.3.2 Third-party Service Provider PCI DSS Compliance Status Review Describe the PCI DSS compliance status review process in detail, including specific information elements to be examined. In particular, it is important that reviewers compare the processes audited as part of the TPSP’s assessment to the services provided to the organization. Describe any risks inherent in using services that were not included in the assessment. Develop a checklist to aid the reviewer. If possible, these criteria should be discussed and revised on an annual basis if the level or type of service changes. 6.1.3.3 Results Write-up Develop a report specification—or even a reporting template—to aid the reviewer in documenting the results of the review of the TPSP PCI DSS compliance status. Documentation should be done in a very consistent manner so that, as different reviewers in the organization participate in the process, they generate similar deliverables. The write-up may include the anniversary date, compliance validation vendors, acquiring bank, sponsor bank, and areas audited. 6.1.3.4 Review Follow-up Specify how TPSP PCI DSS compliance status review results are to be shared and approved internally. Determine steps and timelines for sharing results with the reviewed TPSP, and set expectations with the TPSP if additional work is needed. Describe the escalation procedures that should be carried out if a TPSP falls into a non-compliant status or refuses to obtain or prove PCI DSS compliance or is not required to validate PCI DSS compliance. 6.1.3.5 Access Control and Data Retention Define policies for monitoring and control of program deliverables (for example, supporting documentation, evidence, and results reporting) during generation and subsequent storage. Set a specific policy for retention of monitoring-program data; it is recommended that documentation be retained for a minimum of a rolling three (3) year period. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 30 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 6.2 Other Considerations Note: The following section may be used as a guide on suggestions of how to proceed with a particular scenario. These actions can have unforeseen consequences and should be thoroughly reviewed for impact and risk before engaging in any of the suggested activities. 6.2.1 Third-party Service Provider Does Not Provide Requested Information If a TPSP is unresponsive, or is unable or unwilling to provide the information requested, consider the following actions:  Ensure all communication attempts are documented  Attempt to obtain an explanation from the TPSP: Is too much information being requested? Note: The AOC and/or the relevant sections of the ROC may be sufficient to demonstrate the scope of the assessment and verify its compliance status. Another option to verify the TPSP’s compliance status may be to view the documentation either at the TPSP location or remotely, over a secure session.  If the TPSP has an acquiring bank, contact that bank and request assistance with the TPSP to produce the necessary information.  If all attempts to obtain the requested data have failed, it may be appropriate to involve the payment card brands.  If PCI DSS submission requirements are documented in the contract or agreement with the TPSP, notify the TPSP that the agreement terms are being enforced.  If all else fails, note in the relevant sections of

This episode of Coffee with the Council is brought to you by our podcast sponsors, Feroot and Jscrambler . Welcome to our podcast series, Coffee with the Council . I'm Alicia Malone, Director of Communications and Public Relations for the PCI Security Standards Council. Today, I am so excited to bring you a sneak peek interview with PCI SSC's Asia-Pacific Community Meeting keynote speaker, Sharon Gai. Sharon Gai is a global expert in e-commerce, digital strategy, and cross-cultural innovation. After nearly a decade at Alibaba, guiding global brands through China's digital market, she authored E-Commerce Reimagined and now helps companies bridge east and west. Sharon, it's a pleasure to have you with us today. Sharon Gai: Thank you so much, Alicia. I am so honored to be invited to this podcast and super excited to be jumping into this conversation with you today. Alicia Malone: So, Sharon, I've just introduced you as an expert in retail innovation and artificial intelligence, but I'm curious, how do you define yourself? What title best suits you? Sharon Gai: I usually go with author and keynote speaker, mainly because that's what I do day to day. In sort of one sentence, I help organizations and knowledge workers figure out tomorrow, or the future, in this AI-driven age. So, you could also call me a bodyguard of work, or for workers, if you wish. Where hopefully that with my content, I'm imbuing people with the right skill sets, the right mindsets, pointing them in the right direction of what to concentrate on, because there's going to be a lot of change that's coming down the pipeline. And it's important for more and more of us to know and understand what that change is going to be so that we can orient ourselves to be better positioned for the future. Alicia Malone: I’m always curious about how people carve out unique global careers like yours. Did you always envision yourself working at the intersection of tech, e-commerce, and culture? What is your story and how did your journey begin? Sharon Gai: So, my story began, I guess, with a LinkedIn InMail that I received one day. I don't remember the year by now because it was a very long time ago. So, I was originally born in China, grew up in Canada, came to the U.S. right after college, and then I eventually went back to China. But that journey, or that ping-pong, or that boomerang of back and forth, wasn't as smooth as it is after everything has happened and I'm telling you about the story. But all of the cross-section of the technology, e-commerce piece, and the cultural piece that really came together when I received that LinkedIn InMail. It came from a VP at Alibaba at the time. He was employee #52. Funny enough, he wrote that in his InMail. And at the time, Alibaba was already hundreds of thousands of employees, so when someone says I was employee #52, you kind of pay attention. First, you know, like everyone, I was like, is this spam? Because we all get a lot of those as well. But then I went, I read more into his background, and whatnot, and it was an invitation to an event at Asia Society. Asia Society is this think tank that we have in New York City where I live, where at the time I was already going to every other week or so because I was part of this Young Leaders program there. So, I was already familiar with the location, and I thought, why not go because I would have already been there already. So, I went and funnily enough at this event, I bumped into my high school roommate. So, someone from my past life decades ago, and I said, what are you doing here? And then she said, I didn't know that you were thinking of going back to China also to work. I said, I actually didn't have that thought at all! So, we both sat in the audience, went through the presentation, went through the event. And it was a recruiting event. At the time, Alibaba was a company that was globalizing. So, it had reached, it knew it would be reaching the peak of its user base in China, so it was expanding all around the world, and that was right around when I joined that company. So, I went back to China, and I joined this e-commerce behemoth, and the rest is sort of history with the position that I did at different assignments in, the countries that I moved to, to where I am now. Alicia Malone: I love that story. You just never know where life is going to take you. What do you enjoy most about what you do, and what do you find are the biggest challenges that you encounter? Sharon Gai: I think I am so blessed and fortunate to be in the position that I am. I feel like I have put myself in a self-programmed PhD program that I made up and I designed. I have these modules of learning that I have to go through. I have to write a quote unquote “dissertation”, which is my upcoming book. It feels like a PhD dissertation, but it's basically compiled everything that I have learned and know about things that's happening in the AI space and

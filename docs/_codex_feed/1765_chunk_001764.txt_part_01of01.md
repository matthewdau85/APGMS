Australian Payments Plus (AP+) has launched a three-year charity partnership with Social Ventures Australia (SVA), a leading social impact organisation focused on innovating for good. During the three-year term, AP+ will work closely with SVA to solve challenging social problems and drive real change. Activities will include skilled and general volunteer opportunities for AP+ employees, as well as fundraising activities and select events. “SVA is an innovative social impact organisation that is leading the charge against ‘too hard’. And that focus on innovation, driving change, and sustainability is something that really resonates with us as we also see ourselves as an innovator for good in the payments ecosystem,” said Lynn Kraus, CEO of AP+. “As an organisation, we’re inspired by what’s possible today and by what could be possible beyond tomorrow, and I’m excited to see what we’ll achieve with SVA over the next few years.” SVA works with partners and communities across Australia, with its activities focused on consulting, impact investing, policy and advocacy, as well as operating an innovation hub to trial and scale potential solutions. The organization’s aim is to help more Australians live their best life, offering support across a broad range of sectors and communities from early years and people living with a disability, to First Nations and the homeless. “What a great outcome for SVA to work hand-in-hand with AP+ to take real action on social change. We’re very grateful for their support and look forward to leveraging our collective strengths to alleviate disadvantage across Australia,” said James Toomey, CEO of SVA. “At SVA, we strive to keep people at the centre of everything we do. It’s clear to me already that our people, working together, will be key to a successful partnership as we create new and improved solutions to enable communities to thrive.” SVA was created in 2002 by The Benevolent Society, The Smith Family, Work Ventures and the AMP Foundation. The original desire to find creative solutions to entrenched social problems and speed up the creation of innovative ideas to deliver better social outcomes continues to inspire SVA’s work. In 2024, SVA consulted on over 260 projects across more than a dozen sectors, along with making eight government submissions, altogether supporting more than 430,000 people in Australia.

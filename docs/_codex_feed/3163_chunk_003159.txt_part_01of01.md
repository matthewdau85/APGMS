A person visits your website and pays online. 3. A person calls your shop and provides card details over the phone, or sends the details in the mail or via fax. The more features your payment system has, the more complex it is to secure. Think carefully about whether you really need extra features such as Wi-Fi, remote access software, Internet- connected cameras, or call recording systems for your business. If not properly configu ed and managed, each of these features can provide criminals with easy access to your customers’ payment card data. If you are an e-commerce merchant, it is very important to understand how or if payment data is captured on your website. In most cases, using a wholly outsourced third party to capture and process payments is the safest option.

Don’t let anyone else use them and get new ones every three months. TALK TO YOUR SERVICE PROVIDERS. Ask your vendors or service providers about default passwords and how to change them. Then do it! Also, if your service provider manages passwords for your systems, ask them if they’ve changed those vendor default passwords. MAKE THEM HARD TO GUESS. The most common passwords are “password” and “123456.” Hackers try easily-guessed passwords because they’re used by half of all people.

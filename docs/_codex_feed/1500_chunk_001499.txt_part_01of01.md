prevention system which protects end points and scans the DSP environment to prevent malicious events Policy demonstrating actions that will be taken where anomalies are detected. Supply Chain Visibility of the supply chain allows for the identification of entities (and the functional roles within) that are involved in the transmission of information that generates the payload to the ATO. This includes details of any third-party connections to your product or service via APIs. The functional roles within a supply chain can be defined as: Data collector: party responsible for the acquisition of data through a user interface interaction or APIs. Data validator: party responsible for the verification of data types, structures, formats and/or data values. Data integrator: party responsible for combining data from multiple sources for use. Data analysis and extraction: party responsible for extracting and /or performing analysis on data. Data transformer: party responsible for changing the representation of data to a file format (such as from CSV to XML). Data provider: party responsible for the payload, which may be encrypted. Data transmitter: party responsible for the message with the payload (for example, ebMS3/AS4 transmission). These requirements are an interim measure only and may change when the supply chain visibility solution is available. Evidence required DSPs are required to provide the business details of the participants in the supply chain including: Entity name ABN Service provider role or function. DSPs with an add-on marketplace will need to provide additional information. Third Party add-on marketplaces This requirement seeks to identify security controls and policies you need to implement when partnering with third party add-on providers that allow connection via an API. Examples of add-ons include: Accounting/Taxation: inventory, CRM, OCR scanning Payroll: timesheets, rostering, pay calculator Superannuation: audit integrations, share registries. Note: SSPs and gateways are not considered as DSPs with add-on marketplaces. Evidence required Information and details of the security standard you adopt to govern your add-ons. We do not prescribe or mandate a security standard DSPs apply to their third-party add-ons, but recommend the Security Standard for Add-on Marketplaces (SSAM) as a baseline A list detailing the third-party developers name with hyperlinks to their product or services. The Security Standard for Add-on Marketplaces (SSAM) provides guidance for cloud based third party add-ons who integrate via API with DSPs. This standard applies to: third party add-on developers with more than 1,000 connections to Australian business customers of a DSP those connected to the practice client list of an Australian tax or BAS agent (practice connection).

be PCI DSS compliant, the Customer should confirm that all the consumed services and locations were included in the Provider PCI DSS compliance validation, and that the services are used in a compliant manner. Moreover, the allocation of responsibility between Customer and Provider for managing security controls does not exempt a Customer from the responsibility of ensuring that their cardholder data (CHD) is properly secured according to applicable PCI DSS requirements. Customers should define what PCI DSS requirements are shared among the Customer, Provider and any intermediaries (e.g., a payment gateway) and confirm their compliance. Customers have final responsibility for security of their cardholder data.

Due to the economies of scale associated with the delivery of cloud services, Providers can often provide access to a greater range of technologies and security resources than that to which the Customer might otherwise have access. Organizations without a depth of technically skilled personnel may also wish to leverage the skills and knowledge provided by Provider personnel to securely manage their cloud operations. Cloud computing therefore holds significant potential to help organizations reduce IT complexity and costs, while increasing agility. Cloud computing is also seen as a means to accommodate business requirements for high availability and redundancy, including business continuity and disaster recovery. 2.1 Cloud Deployment Models Deployment models are defined to distinguish between different models of ownership and distribution of the resources used to deliver cloud services. Cloud environments may be deployed over a private infrastructure, public infrastructure or a combination of both. The most common deployment models include:6 ▪ Public cloud: Cloud deployment model where cloud services are potentially available to any Customer and resources are controlled by the Provider. A public cloud may be owned, managed and operated by a business, academic or government organization, or some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the Provider. Actual availability for specific Customers may be subject to jurisdictional regulations. Public clouds have very broad boundaries, where Customer access to public cloud services has few, if any, restrictions. ▪ Private cloud: Cloud deployment model where cloud services are used exclusively by a single Customer and resources are controlled by that Customer. A private cloud may be owned, managed and operated by the organization itself or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises. Private clouds seek to set a narrowly controlled boundary around the private cloud based on limiting the customers to a single organization. ▪ Community cloud: Cloud deployment model where cloud services exclusively support and are shared by a specific collection of Customers who have shared requirements and a relationship with one another, and where resources are controlled by at least one member of this collection. A community cloud may be owned, managed and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises. Community clouds limit participation to a group of Customers who have a shared set of objectives, in contrast to the openness of public clouds, 5 Peter Mell and Timothy Grance, The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing Special Publication 800-145, NIST Special Publication 800-145 (Gaithersburg: National Institute of Standards and Technology, December 2011). https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-145. 6 Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1.

These shared concerns include, but are not limited to, mission, information security requirements, policy and compliance considerations. ▪ Hybrid cloud – The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community or public) that remain unique entities but are bound together by technology to enable portability. Hybrid clouds are often used for redundancy or load-balancing purposesfor example, applications within a private cloud could be configured to utilize computing resources from a public cloud as needed during peak capacity times (sometimes called "cloud-bursting"). 2.2 Cloud Capabilities Types and Cloud Service Categories Cloud service categories ("<Something>-as-a-Service") identify different control options for the Customer and Provider. For example, SaaS Customers simply use the applications and services provided by the Provider, where IaaS Customers maintain control of their own environments hosted on the Provider’s underlying infrastructure. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines three types of cloud service categories.7 Software as a Service (SaaS) – Capability for Customers to use the Provider’s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser, or a program interface. Platform as a Service (PaaS) – Capability for Customers to deploy their applications (created or acquired) onto the cloud infrastructure, using programming languages, libraries, services and

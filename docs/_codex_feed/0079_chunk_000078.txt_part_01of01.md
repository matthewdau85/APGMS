Control the future of the framework AusPayNet will continually test the validity of the target end-date based on the industry’s progress on transitioning BECS use cases off the BECS Framework, and intends to provide an update on the target end-date for the framework to its Members and key stakeholders on a half-yearly basis. Collaborate with industry AusPayNet is collaborating with regulators and industry participants on a number of initiatives to facilitate the migration away from the BECS Framework. These include: Treasury’s engagement with relevant government agencies and other key users of BECS bulk payments on their needs and readiness to transition away from BECS The RBA’s risk assessment for the decommissioning of BECS, monitoring of NPP readiness (covering account reach, cost, capabilities for direct debit and bulk payments, capacity and reliability) and FSS readiness to take on BECS volumes, and Account-to-Account Pricing Study Initiatives or programs established by providers of modern alternatives to BECS for the migration of BECS use cases to their platforms BECS members’ own transition plans. Coordinate the migration AusPayNet recognises that a successful decommissioning of BECS may benefit from collaboration between industry participants (including those that may be considered competitors). As such, any potential coordination plan would need to be designed in a way that ensures compliance with competition laws (which, in some cases, is best achieved by seeking authorisation from the ACCC). AusPayNet is monitoring industry developments and continually assessing whether there might be a need for wider coordination (and ACCC authorisation, if appropriate). Cross-border payments update Interlinking fast payment systems The evolution of cross-border payments in the ASEAN Region is rapidly occurring. The central banks and fast payment system operators of Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, along with the Bank for International Settlements, have agreed to work towards Phase 4 , the live implementation of Project Nexus. The Nexus platform will connect multiple domestic fast payment systems globally for cross-border payments. Moreover, the Reserve Bank of India and India’s fast payment system, Universal Payments Infrastructure (UPI), have also joined Phase 4. UPI is currently the world’s largest fast payment system. Other ASEAN members who are party to the Regional Payment Connectivity MoU ( Brunei , Laos and Vietnam ) will likely join Phase 4 at a later stage, while Indonesia is also an observer on the project. When fully implemented, the Nexus platform will enhance cross-border payments in line with the G20 cross-border payments programme, which aims to deliver faster, cheaper, and more transparent and inclusive cross-border payments. Connectivity tests have also been successfully completed with the Eurosystem’s TARGET Instant Payment System (TIPS). Technical assistance The inaugural Pacific Banking Forum , hosted by the Australian and US governments, was held in Brisbane in July. It brought together Finance Ministers, Central Bank Governors, regulators, international financial institutions, multilateral development banks, policy makers, Financial Intelligence Units and commercial banks to discuss the critical decline in correspondent banking relationships that support the remittance, trade and investment flows into and out of the Pacific region. All parties to the Forum agreed to work together to grow correspondent banking relationships in the Pacific region. Additionally, the parties agreed to promote coordination in operationalising AML/CTF frameworks, and to identify practical and innovative solutions to maintain access to and growth of correspondent banking relationships available to Pacific Island states. Significant commitments were put in place by the US, Australia, New Zealand, the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and International Monetary Fund, as well as the private sector. Cross-border payments In July, the Financial Stability Board released a series of consultations related to its recommendations, which are designed to promote greater alignment in data frameworks related to cross-border payments, and consistency in the regulation and supervision of bank and non-bank PSPs. These reports take forward priority actions under the G20 Roadmap to address legal, supervisory and regulatory frictions in cross-border payments to help achieve the quantitative targets in 2027. AusPayNet will coordinate responses from industry by 9 September 2024. ISO 20022 migration update Rob Magee, Program Director of the Australian ISO 20022 Industry Migration Program and Co-Chair of the High Value Payments Plus (HVPS+) group, recently penned an article for The Paypers, entitled ‘ Enabling the evolution and interoperability of cross-border and domestic high-value ISO 20022 payments ’.

service providers (PSP) can help align compliance efforts. This team should be responsible for understanding the acquirer’s requirements and, where possible, have representatives from a cross section of departments within the organization. 6.2 Compliance Agreements and Expectations When establishing agreements, the following inclusions can help to develop a common understanding and expectation for PCI DSS compliance responsibilities:  Clearly stating and defining an organization’s payment channels that are associated with the acquirer.  Providing details of the contractual commitment from the PSP that demonstrates its commitment to maintaining the appropriate security of cardholder data that it obtains from the organization.  Maintaining a written agreement that includes an acknowledgment that service providers are responsible for protecting the cardholder data they possess or otherwise store, process, or transmit on behalf of the customer, or to the extent that they could impact the security of the customer’s cardholder data environment. This should be done for all involved parties; otherwise, it can affect a report on compliance (ROC).  Determining all SAQ scenarios eligible for each payment channel (SAQ A, SAQ B, SAQ B-IP, etc.).  Generating documentation needed to report to the acquirer for each payment channel (for example, ROC, SAQ, AOC, and ASV reports).  Identifying specific PCI DSS requirements with which the entity needs to comply (for example, PCI DSS Designated Entities Supplemental Validation [DESV] requirements).  Identifying dates specified for supplying documentation to the acquirer. 6.3 Reporting Multiple Payment Channels Organizations should always contact their acquirer (merchant bank) or payment brand directly to understand their compliance validation obligations, including which SAQ they may be eligible to use. Some acquirers may ask an entity to combine its PCI DSS validation for multiple payment channels into a single ROC, while other acquirers request that the organization submit a separate report for each payment channel. This approach will need to be agreed by each acquirer individually. Large organizations should inform their assessors about the Information Supplement • PCI DSS for Large Organizations • February 2020 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

The company operates with a different local acquirer in each region. To process payments in the five regions, the company uses a range of methods including:  Point-Of-Interaction (POI) terminals using a P2PE-listed solution  POI terminals from a local acquirer  An e-commerce platform  A call center where operators can enter payments manually In this example, the organization needs to consider the following card-payment channels:  Card-Present/Face to Face channel: – POI devices in five different regions (POI P2PE-listed solutions and POI terminals offered by the local acquirers)  Card-Not-Present channels: – Ecommerce website – MOTO sales (virtual terminal / PAN entered on card-entry device) To handle its PCI compliance obligations, the organization’s internal PCI DSS compliance team should ask all acquirers about the annual volume of transactions for each existing channel. This figure will relate to the company’s merchant level per channel. After all PCI DSS obligations are confirmed with each acquirer, the internal PCI DSS team can organize PCI DSS reviews with local QSA companies in each region, informing the QSA companies about the agreements in place with the acquirers for each payment channel.

For example, having numerous audits and assessments can introduce staggered or overlapping timeframes for each assessment along with potentially unique assessment processes for each assessment type. Conducting multiple different audit processes may require evidence to be provided from a common set of assets, which risks that the requested evidence may not be consistent and results in a potentially considerable amount of duplicated effort. 7.1 Compliance Cycles and Assessments Managing and coordinating PCI DSS assessments can be demanding in large organizations with multiple service providers who work with different business units. Business units and service providers that do not comply with required

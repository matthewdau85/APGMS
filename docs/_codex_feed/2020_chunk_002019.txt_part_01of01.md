API Sandbox NPPA in conjunction with SWIFT have developed an API sandbox to help Third Party Service Providers and software developers to learn and test the NPP’s capabilities via the available sample NPP APIs. External parties can build and test NPP based solutions in this independent environment. To request access to the API Sandbox, please go to: https://nppa-developer.swift.com/user/register Glossary & abbreviations used in this document Term Description Addressing Service Component of the NPP platform infrastructure that enables registration of customer account information and PayID (account proxy) information API Application Programming Interface NPP Basic Infrastructure NPP platform infrastructure that supports the processing of NPP payments Connected Institutions Connect directly to the NPP solely for the purposes of sending and receiving non-value messages such as payment initiation messages NPP API Framework – Publication Version 5.0 Page 9 Term Description Initiating Participant An NPP Participant who sends payment initiation requests on behalf of a customer FSS Refers to the RBA Fast Settlement Service that settles NPP payments in real-time JSON JavaScript Object Notation NPP Participant Connects directly to the NPP for the purposes of clearing and settling NPP Payments Mandate Refers to a PayTo agreement that enables a payer customer to pre-authorise third parties to initiate payments from the customer’s bank account MMS Refers to the Mandate Management Service which is a centralised access-controlled database managed by NPPA that stores mandate records Overlay Service Refers to a payment service, or payment-related service, using the NPP Overlay Service Provider Overlay Service Providers provide customised Overlay Services that sit on top of the NPP and utilise the underlying infrastructure. Overlay Service Providers may also be Connected Institutions PayID Refers to an alias record in the Addressing Service. The Addressing Service provides a mechanism that allows a registered PayID (acting as a unique identifier for a customer account) to be resolved to a bank account. A PayID can be one of four alias types; phone number, email address, ABN or Organisational Identifier RESTful Representational state transfer (REST) or RESTful web services Third Party Service Provider Payment service providers that are third parties (i.e. not any of the following: owner of the account, the account servicer or the account servicer’s sponsoring Participant) NPP API Framework – Publication Version 5.0 Page 10 2 NPP Open API Design Principles Basics The following key design principles incorporate both RESTful concepts and ISO20022 as the data standard and describes additional considerations in the development of APIs for use on the NPP. RESTful APIs Each NPP API should adhere to the RESTful API concepts as the transfer standard of choice. A RESTful API is a set of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request messages, along with a definition of the structure of response messages, which is in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. Overall, the priority should be to have an API that is simple to understand and easy to use. In instances where following RESTful principles would be convoluted and complex, the principles have not been followed. References: • The highest level Data Description Language used is the JSON Schema: http://json-schema.org/ • Best Practice has also been taken from the Data Description Language for APIs; JSON API: http://jsonapi.org/ • The Interface Description Language used is the Swagger Specification version 2.0 (also known as Open API): http://swagger.io/ ISO 20022 NPP API payloads should be designed based on existing ISO 20022 message elements and components, where available, as the data standard. Intended to decrease implementation time for developers to consume, these APIs support interoperability with the asynchronous NPP message formats currently used across the Platform. The principles applied to the re-use of ISO message elements and components are: • Where relevant – the API payloads should be flattened so that they are more developer friendly. • Only elements that are required for the functioning of the API endpoint should be included in the API payload. API endpoints are defined for specific use-cases (not to be generically extensible for all use-cases). For example - only elements that are required for a single immediate payment initiation would be included in the Payment API payload. • Support modification of ISO 20022 elements where the existing standard does not cater for an API context (such as filtering, pagination etc.). For example, latitude and longitude in decimal format - as this is how developers will work with latitude and longitude; or using simple types (e.g. a single date-time field) instead of a complex type (e.g. a choice field with a nesting of date and time). • Consideration of ISO 20022 and JSON: An Implementation Best Practices. Includes pertinent modelling guides NPP API Framework – Publication Version 5.0 Page 11 Security Standards Each NPP Participant is responsible for setting the security standards for Third Party Service Providers connecting to that NPP Participant via APIs. NPPA recommends the use of global best practice in security standards where possible. NPP Overlay Service Identification In order to support in each common API request call, a mechanism to vary the API call attributes according to Overlay Service, the Service Level element (from <SvcLvl/Prtry> element in ISO 20022> is defined as

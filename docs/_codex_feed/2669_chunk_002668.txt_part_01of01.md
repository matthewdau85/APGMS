The requirements set forth in the PFI Qualification Requirements, and the information and materials specifically required from PFI Companies and candidate PFI Companies hereunder, are in addition to the requirements and the information and materials to be provided under the QSA Qualification Requirements. 2.2 Required Certificates, Licenses and Permits Some jurisdictions may require companies and/or individuals engaged in forensic and/or private investigation or other services in connection with Security Issues to be certified or licensed to do so or to obtain other permits, authorizations, permissions or consents in connection with such work (“Required Certifications and Consents”). It is the responsibility of each PFI Company to determine which, if any, Required Certifications and Consents are required, and to obtain all Required Certifications and Consents prior to engaging in PFI work. Neither PCI SSC nor any other Approving Organization is or shall be responsible for making any such determination or for obtaining or informing any PFI Company or PFI Employee regarding Required Certifications and Consents. 2.3 Independence PFI Companies and PFI Employees must satisfy the requirements of this Section 2.3 and the separate independence requirements specified in the QSA Qualification Requirements (all of the foregoing, collectively, the “Independence Requirements”):  PFI Companies and PFI Employees must perform all PFI Investigations, and render and deliver all associated PFI Services, conclusions, findings and PFI Reports (defined in the PFI Program Guide), in a manner that is free from sources of influence and other factors that might reasonably be expected to compromise or have the appearance of compromising in any material respect their independence, professional judgment, integrity, objectivity, impartiality or professional skepticism in performing, rendering or delivering the same, or their ability to do so in a timely and professional manner in accordance with all applicable PFI Requirements (each a “Threat,” and collectively, “Threats”), whether such Threats arise from actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest, lack of independence from the Entity Under Investigation (and/or its associated personnel, representatives, contractors, professional advisors or agents) or otherwise. Note: Any agreement, relationship or restriction that materially impairs (or has the appearance of so impairing) the PFI Company’s or PFI Employee’s independence, professional judgment, integrity, objectivity, impartiality, or professional skepticism in rendering its findings, conclusions or PFI Reports, without appropriate disclosure and countervailing measures, is deemed to violate these independence requirements PCI Qualification Requirements for PFIs, v3.0 August 2016 © 2016 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

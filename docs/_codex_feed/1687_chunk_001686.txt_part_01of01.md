Schedule of Sunset Dates for Approved Devices November 2024 Participants in the Issuers and Acquirers Community are required to use devices which are approved for use within the IAC under the Device Approval Program. Approval Period • For devices approved by PCI, the approval period ends on the PCI expiry date. • For HSM devices approved under the NIST CVMP program, the approval period ends when the validation certificate expires (NIST use the term sunset date and expiration date interchangeably). • For devices approved by AusPayNet following a Structured Risk Assessment (SRA), the approval period expires on the date stated in the letter of approval. Sunset Period After the Approval Period has expired, devices may continue to be used in the IAC until the Sunset Date is reached. Approved Devices within either the Approval Period or Sunset Period are considered approved for the purposes of the IAC Code Set. Sunset Dates The following table provides sunset dates for different classes of Approved Devices. This table is used to determine sunset dates for devices on the IAC Expired Devices List3 and can be used to determine the sunset date for a device based upon its PCI or NIST approval. Devices which have reached their Sunset Date are not approved for use within the IAC.

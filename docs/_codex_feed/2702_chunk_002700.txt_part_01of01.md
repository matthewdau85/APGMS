customer (to keep their data secure) to an automated call- handling system (or IVR). 4. The agent has the option to terminate the call whilst the customer progresses the transaction independently. The type and related scripting of the IVR system used will be different for each entity. Within the IVR journey the IVR then asks the customer to input their PAN and SAD using their telephone keypad. 5. The IVR application receives confirmation that the payment is authorized and communicates that, or any other outcome returned from the PSP, back to the customer. An option to return to the agent may be implemented.  When digital technologies are deployed: 1. The customer and order details are spoken by the customer to the agent. 2. The agent enters the customer and order details into a system. 3. The agent initiates the digital application and sends the customer a link to a secure internet payment system. 4. The customer validates the URL, confirms the transaction amount and delivery address, submits card account data into the payment page and provides the 3DS authentication parameters (where required). 5. The agent has the option to terminate the call whilst the customer progresses the transaction independently as an ecommerce transaction. An entity may choose to deploy a fully automated version of a telephony-based or digital-based solution with no agent interface as an alternative to the examples above or as an “out-of-hours” alternative to the above (for example, automated speech recognition). 6.3 Digital-based Attended and Unattended Solutions Digital technology solutions have no dependency on the organization’s telephony infrastructure. The level of impact on an organization’s scope is dependent on how the chosen technology is implemented by the vendor. In general terms, both attended and unattended digital technologies could use the public Internet to deliver links to the customer. The customer would access that link via their connected device (smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop) and then use it to send transaction data directly to the entity’s PSP/payment gateway. Sending a link to an online secure payment system to a customer via a messaging service may be considered the same as an e-commerce entity using redirection to third-party payment pages. The impact of such a system on the entity’s PCI DSS scope would need to be evaluated. In such case, the integrity and validity of the link to an online secure payment system must also be considered. Information Supplement • Protecting Telephone-Based Payment Card Data • November 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 32 6.4 Telephone-based Attended and Unattended Technologies All telephony-based technology solutions have a dependency on the organization’s telephony infrastructure. The level of that dependency and the impact on an entity’s scope are based on the actual design and how the chosen technology is implemented. In general terms, both attended and unattended classifications of telephony-based technologies may use DTMF tones, which are transmitted by a telephone device (mobile, data, or fixed line) when the customer enters PAN and SAD via their telephone keypad. DTMF tones are easily detectable by phone systems and computers, and anyone with the right equipment can convert the tones back to the original digits or characters. Alternatively, the organization may use pause-and-resume technology, and in this case the agent will hear all of the CHD and SAD; and the organization must adopt and implement all relevant security procedures detailed in this document in order to secure that data. 6.4.1 Attended Telephony Technologies Attended technology solutions enable the entity to remain in constant voice contact with its customer for the entire duration of the telephone transaction. These technology types rely on DTMF suppression or DTMF masking to reduce PAN and SAD exposure in these transactions. These technologies typically replace the DTMF tones with flat sounds before they reach the agent, who often hears only a single repetitive tone. The result is that the different tones made by the customer’s telephone keypad are concealed such that the agent cannot identify them by their sound. To be effective, the sound replacing the original DTMF tone must not be linked to it, whether the masking tone is always the same sound or a random sound. Storing only suppressed tones rather than original DTMF tones can reduce applicability of PCI DSS requirements for call recordings—for example, recordings and audio files containing only flat tones that cannot be converted back to the original data do not need to be rendered unreadable per PCI DSS Requirement 3.4. In this scenario, the entity would need to verify that the recordings contain only flat tones, and that the suppression method ensures the tones cannot be converted back to the original data. Even if only suppressed tones are stored and are not subject to Requirement 3.4, recording systems may still be in scope for other PCI DSS requirements if they have connectivity to the systems where CHD is present. Where the DTMF tones are not replaced with flat, token, or random sounds, the specific numbers associated with each key press can be recovered, meaning that PAN and SAD is retrievable and the unaltered DTMF tones are fully in scope for applicable PCI DSS requirements. To complement audio suppression of the DTMF tones, some solutions also integrate with the agent desktop environment to prevent PAN and SAD being captured or displayed on the agent’s screen.

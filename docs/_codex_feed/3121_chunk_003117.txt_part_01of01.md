CASE STUDY Internal Security Assessor (ISA) Training Real Experience. Real Benefits. No one tells our story better than our training participants themselves. Here’s what Adam had to say... Why did you choose to get training through the Council? After doing research on available courses, it made the most sense to go directly to the PCI Council for the training. Being the issuing body, I thought the Council would be able to provide the best information on how to adapt to the increasing need for security in our business. How does this training benefit you – and your company? Being a fast growing company we’re always looking to stay in front of security requirements. Cafe Rio is approaching level 1 merchant designation and I wanted to get the in-house PCI knowledge that would help us be better prepared for having a Report on Compliance prepared by a QSA. The PCI ISA training was an excellent way to learn how to incorporate the extensive PCI requirements into our everyday business. It’s given us immediate credibility with our processor and has made the process of working hand- in-hand with our external auditors much easier, too. How have you applied what you learned in this course, in your job? I use the knowledge from the training daily. With almost 75% of our payments in our restaurants being credit cards, we wanted to make sure our customers and our business is well protected. The ISA training has allowed us proactively look at our business and procedures and adjust them to incorporate the current PCI standards. The ISA qualification also has given me added credibility in the organization to make the changes necessary to be PCI compliant. If you had to pick one best thing about the training, what would that be? During the two-day course, I had the chance to interact directly with the instructor during breaks and ask specific questions pertinent to my business. I also met a number of people across different industries and got to compare our PCI efforts. It’s always great to meet other industry professionals and learn from their experiences. Do you feel the training was worthwhile? Yes and I would absolutely recommend it! It has saved us countless hours of internal rework and saved us billable hours with our external auditors. The payoff is quick and easily apparent. THE COMPANY Cafe Rio Mexican Grill 215 N. Admiral Byrd Rd.

one of the major issues (data security) that Japanese society is currently facing that needs to be resolved. I genuinely want to be involved in it. In addition, I believe my experiences in the payments industry are relevant to this role. Ihara-san, can you share any good or interesting memories while working at PCI SSC? Ryoji Ihara: Yes, I have had many memorable experiences through PCI SSC, and one of the good experiences was collaborating with local stakeholders to publish the Japanese version of the PCI DSS v4.0 documents. We were required to publish those documents with the highest quality of Japanese translation because it is directly linked to the local law. The QSAs through JCDSC (Japan Card Data Security Consortium) worked together to review the Japanese drafts of PCI DSS v4.0, which was provided by PCI SSC. The reviewed version was published on the PCI SSC website. This was a good model of collaboration between PCI SSC and local stakeholders. Junichi Tsuboi: I see. There were a lot of memorable experiences. Our time is limited, and I have one final question for you. What are you going to do after you retire from PCI SSC? I think many stakeholders will be interested in this. Ryoji Ihara: I will have left PCI SSC when this podcast is released. After I leave, I would like to spend my time volunteering to support the payment industry, which I have worked in for a long time. I will also be volunteering in my favorite place, Okinawa (southern islands in Japan), to protect the natural heritage there. Junichi Tsuboi: That’s great! Ryoji Ihara: Finally, my last question to you, Tsuboi-san. Since this is the Coffee with the Council podcast, I would like to ask you what kind of coffee do you like? If you are not a coffee drinker, what other beverages do you like to drink? My favorite coffee is called “American Coffee,” adding hot water to regular coffee. However, it becomes less stimulating and easier for me to drink a lot of it now. How about you? Junichi Tsuboi: I love coffee very much and drink it every morning. My favorite is sour-tasting coffee like Kilimanjaro. However, I also love some alcohol at the end of the day, especially pure dry rice wine (Japanese sake). This is fantastic and makes me so happy, as you can imagine! Please let us drink together in the near future and I look forward to seeing you again soon! Ryoji Ihara: Thank you, let’s get drinks together! And I wish you all the best at PCI SSC! Junichi Tsuboi: Thank you, Ihara-san, and thank you, everyone, for listening to this Coffee with the Council episode. Finally, the PCI SSC Asia-Pacific Community Meeting will be in Bangkok, Thailand this year on 5 and 6 November. Do come and join us and I would love to meet you in person! Thank you, everyone!

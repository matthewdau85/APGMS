Anti-Virus Software * Software program that detects, removes, and protects against malicious software (also called “malware”) including viruses, worms, Trojans or Trojan horses, spyware, adware, and rootkits. Also called “anti-malware software.” Application * Software program or group of programs that runs on a PC, smartphone, tablet, internal server, or web server. Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) * Company approved by the PCI Security Standards Council to conduct external vulnerability scanning services to identify common weaknesses in system configuration. Authentication * Method for verifying the identity of a person, device, or process attempting to access a computer. To confirm the identity/user is valid, one or more of the following is provided: • A password or passphrase (something the user knows) • A token, smart card, or digital certificate unique to the user (something the user has) • A biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint (something the user is or does) Authorization * In a payment card transaction, authorization occurs when a merchant receives transaction approval after the acquirer validates the transaction with the issuer/processor. Bank Identification Number (BIN) The first six digits (or more) of a payment card number that identifies the financial institution that issued the payment card to the cardholder. Business Need-to-Know The principle that access to systems or data is granted by a user’s business need—only what is necessary for a user’s job function. Card Data / Customer Card Data * At a minimum, card data includes the primary account number (PAN), and may also include cardholder name and expiration date. The PAN is visible on the front of the card and encoded into the card’s magnetic stripe and/or the embedded chip. Also referred to as cardholder data. See also Sensitive Authentication Data for additional data elements which may be part of a payment transaction but which must not be stored after the transaction is authorized. Chip Also known as “EMV Chip.” The microprocessor (or “chip”) on a payment card used when processing transactions in accordance with the international specifications for EMV transactions. Chip and PIN A verification process where a consumer enters their PIN in an EMV Chip-enabled payment terminal when they purchase goods or services. 3 Glossary Data Security Essentials for Small Merchants: Glossary of Payment and Information Security Terms | August 2018 Copyright 2018 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved. TERM DEFINITION Chip and Signature A verification process where a consumer uses their signature with an EMV Chip-enabled payment terminal when they purchase goods or services. Credential Information used to identify and authenticate a user for access to a system. For example, credentials are often the username and password. Credentials may include a fingerprint, retina scan, or a one-time number generated by a portable “token-generator.” Security is stronger when access requires multiple credentials. Cryptography Cryptography is the method of securing data by making it unintelligible to a human or computer. Cryptography is only useful when the intended recipient can reassemble the data into a readable form using a method known only to the sender and receiver. See also Encryption. Cyber-Attack Any offensive action to break into a computer or system. Cyber-attacks can range from installing spyware on a PC, breaking into a payment system to steal card data, or attempting to break critical infrastructure such as an electric power grid. Data Breach A data breach is an incident in which sensitive data may have potentially been viewed, stolen, or used by an unauthorized party. Data breaches may involve card data, personal health information (PHI), personally identifiable information (PII), trade secrets, or intellectual property, etc. Default Password A simple password that comes with new software or hardware. Default passwords (like “admin” or “password” or “123456”) are easily guessed and usually

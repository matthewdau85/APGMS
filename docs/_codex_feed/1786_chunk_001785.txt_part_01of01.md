Australia’s domestic payments provider, Australian Payments Plus (AP+) will partner with Beyond Blue, to promote workplace mental health and provide funding for the Beyond Blue Support Service. As AP+’s charity partner, Beyond Blue will provide evidence-based mental health resources, tools and information to support AP+ staff, stakeholders and customers to maintain good mental health. This includes stories of hope, resilience and recovery from people living with mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety. The Beyond Blue Support Service, which received more than 300,000 contacts last year, will also receive a significant donation. The free service offers immediate and confidential counselling, coaching, advice and referrals via telephone, web chat and email 24/7. Beyond Blue’s Australia-wide reach was a big part in forming the partnership, AP+ CEO Lynn Kraus said. “I am delighted to lead such a purpose driven organisation. We take our role as an employer of talented, great people seriously and are committed to supporting their mental wellbeing through information and support services. We believe our partnership with Beyond Blue will allow us to further deliver on this commitment,” Ms Kraus said. “Additionally, our teams are passionate about giving back and through our work with Beyond Blue we will have the opportunity to volunteer and support the communities in which we live and work.” Beyond Blue’s Chief Community Officer Patrice O’Brien said the organisation was thrilled to partner with AP+ and applauded the company’s commitment to providing mentally healthy workplaces for its staff and customers. “Beyond Blue is also incredibly grateful for the generous donation that will ensure people living in rural, regional and metropolitan communities right across Australia receive quality mental health support when they need it,” Ms O’Brien said. “Almost one in two adults in Australia will experience a mental health condition in their lifetime, and more than 70 per cent say they are concerned about mental health issues. Access to early mental health care and support has never been more important. “The earlier people seek help, the sooner they can get back to good health, back to work and their families and back to enjoying their lives.”

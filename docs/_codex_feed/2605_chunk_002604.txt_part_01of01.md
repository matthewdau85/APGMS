expiration or termination and the reason(s) therefor. The provisions of Sections A.5.4, A.6, A.7, A.9.4 and A.10 of this Agreement shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any or no reason. A.9.5 Revocation (a) Without limiting the rights of PCI SSC as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, in the event that PCI SSC determines in its sole but reasonable discretion that CPSA meets any condition for revocation of its Qualification as a CPSA Company as established by PCI SSC from time to time (satisfaction of any such condition, a “Violation”), including without limitation, any of the conditions identified as or described as examples of Violations herein or in the CPSA Qualification Requirements, PCI SSC may, effective immediately upon notice of such Violation to CPSA, revoke such Qualification from CPSA (“Revocation”), and such revoked Qualification shall be subject to reinstatement pending a successful appeal in accordance with Section A.9.5(b) below and PCI SSC policies and procedures.

Page 38 (b) In the event of any Revocation: (i) CPSA will be removed from the CPSA List(s) and/or its listing(s) thereupon may be annotated as PCI SSC deems appropriate; (ii) upon revocation of Qualification as a CPSA Company, CPSA must comply with Section A.9.4 above in the manner otherwise required if this Agreement had been terminated as of the effective date of such Revocation; (iii) CPSA will have a period of thirty (30) days from the date CPSA is given notice of such Violation to submit its written request for appeal to the CPSA Program Manager; (iv) CPSA shall, within fifteen (15) days of such Revocation, in a manner acceptable to PCI SSC, provide notice of such Revocation to those of its CPSA Company clients with which CPSA is then engaged to perform any PCI Card Production Assessment or other Services for which such revoked Qualification is required and, if applicable, of any conditions, restrictions or requirements of such Revocation that may impact its ability to perform such PCI Card Production Assessment or other Services for such CPSA Company clients going forward; and (v) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, PCI SSC may notify any of its Members and any acquirers, CPSA Company clients, or others of such Revocation and the reason(s) therefor. In the event CPSA fails to submit a request for appeal within the allotted 30-day period or such request is denied, this Agreement shall automatically terminate and CPSA’s right to such appeal shall be forfeited effective immediately as of the end of such period or such denial, as applicable. (c) All Revocation appeal proceedings will be conducted in accordance with such procedures as PCI SSC may establish from time to time for the CPSA Program, PCI SSC will review all relevant evidence submitted by CPSA and each complainant (if any) in connection with therewith, and PCI SSC shall determine whether termination of CPSA’s Qualification is warranted or, in the alternative, no action, or specified remedial actions shall be required. All determinations of PCI SSC regarding Revocation and any related termination or appeals shall be final and binding upon CPSA. If PCI SSC determines that termination is warranted, then effective immediately and automatically upon such determination, such Qualification and this Agreement shall terminate. If PCI SSC determines that such termination is not warranted, the Revocation shall be lifted, such Qualification shall be reinstated, and the listing of CPSA that was removed from the CPSA List as a result of such Revocation shall be reinstated. If PCI SSC determines that remedial action is required, PCI SSC shall notify CPSA and may establish a date by which such remedial action must be completed; provided, however, that unless otherwise agreed by PCI SSC in writing the Revocation shall not be lifted, and CPSA shall not be reinstated on the CPSA List, unless and until such time as CPSA has completed such remedial action; and provided, further, that if CPSA fails to complete any required remedial actions by the date (if any) established by PCI SSC for completion thereof, PCI SSC may terminate such Qualification and this Agreement, effective immediately as of or any time after such date.

E-13B font supplied with the system, or alter it in any way, as this will invalidate any guarantee or accreditation that comes with the system. If choosing to in-fill cheque documents using a non-impact method it is suggested that a paper with toner enhanced, or frangible toner enhanced, features be considered. Consult with your security printer or refer to the AusPayNet Paper Register for suitable paper stocks. Amended, effective 19/05/08 MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 32 AusPayNet September 2017 4.3.1 Accreditation of MICR Printing Systems To protect the efficiency of the clearing system, a process of accreditation of MICR printing systems has been adopted. This was necessary because of the large number of new high-volume non-impact MICR printers that are being sold in Australia. The large volumes of MICR documents that these systems can potentially supply could cause adverse effects on the clearing system if the MICR is not of an acceptable standard. The accreditation process has been effective since January 1, 1998 and is detailed in Appendix 3 of this publication. The procedures define a “printing system” as a means of printing technology that is claimed to be suitable for producing MICR documents and includes the print engine, operating system, page description language (PDL) magnetic toner and the E-13B font. It usually covers all printers with increasing levels of testing applied relative to the system’s potential productivity. Accreditation indicates that a Printing System, when operated in accordance with the Applicant's specifications, is capable of producing acceptable MICR encoding and has passed tests for accreditation of MICR Printing Systems as detailed in Appendix 3 of this publication. AusPayNet maintains a Register of accredited MICR Printing Systems and will provide information on these systems to any interested party (refer Appendix 3, section 1.6.). However, due to manufacturing and/or operating variances, the Register is not a guarantee that an individual Printing System will produce acceptable results. The inclusion of a Printing System on the Register is not an endorsement by AusPayNet. The Register lists Printing Systems that have been submitted to AusPayNet for testing and found at the time of testing to have met the requirements set out in Appendix 3 of this publication. Amended, effective 22/03/06 4.3.2 Security Because of the comparative ease of operation of many non-impact MICR printing systems, especially desktop units, and as they are often set up to print value cheques there is a need to guard against their improper use. It is recommended that some or all of the following security precautions be used with non-impact MICR printing systems, the selection being made on a judgement of the element of risk:  System keylock to prevent unauthorised use  Access control via Personal Identification Number or multiple level passwords  Encryption of signatures and/or E-13B font on a removable printer cartridge which can be stored securely  An audit trail held in non-volatile memory to record the details of every cheque printing transaction In addition, care must be taken with the storage and use of pre-printed cheque stock where audit records should be kept to account of its use for authorised cheque issue, samples for MICR quality and spoilt cheques, together with a record of any stock destroyed for whatever purpose. 4.3.3 Print Quality Under magnification, it can be seen that images are made up of a series of fine dots that create a continuous image when viewed by the naked eye. The size of these MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 33 AusPayNet September 2017 dots determines print quality and is known as the print resolution. This is described in terms of dots per inch (dpi) and applies both across and along the direction of paper travel. If expressed as a single value, the dpi value applies in both directions. If two values are quoted, the resolution varies by direction and the first figure quoted is the resolution across the paper path. When comparing print quality from different technologies, the resolution can be misleading and the method of dot formation affects its appearance. It is thus best to make a judgement on the basis of printed samples. 4.3.4 Software The software application that is used to position data on a page is known as the Page Description Language (PDL). Extreme caution needs to be taken when selecting a PDL to ensure that it can meet the character spacing requirements outlined in this publication in a predictable manner. 4.3.5 MICR Toner or Dry Ink MICR Toner is manufactured from carbon black, iron oxide and resins. The formulations are specifically developed for each print engine and their properties are critical to successful MICR printing. The iron oxide used is in the form of the mineral magnetite and is capable of being magnetised by a reader/sorter write head to a suitable level to be interpreted by the magnetic read head. The mineral occurs in two crystalline forms, cubic and needle- like. The latter form is favoured for MICR toner as it retains magnetism better than the cubic form. Certain technologies however require the cubic form to be used and have had to undergo considerably more development to obtain a suitable toner. It is essential that only MICR toner, as opposed to normal toner, is used for printing E-13B characters and printing systems that are designed to detect or accept only specifically designed MICR toner containers. This avoids potential problems with the

awareness and education training in global organizations include managing translations of training content into multiple local languages and tracking regional training effectiveness. Local laws and customs may make it hard, if not impossible, to track employee performance of training due to privacy restrictions and how training material has been communicated. This can lead to situations where proof of training varies between countries due to the lack of centralized record management. Organizations with diverse functions and staff skill levels across its staff may need to create multiple versions of its PCI DSS training that are tailored to each skill level and function. The day-to-day activities of customer- facing staff, such as cashiers, is very different from that of a database administrator or security operations staff. Defining the roles and PCI DSS knowledge required are critical first steps. Training for customer-facing staff should be developed with a focus on the impact of the service provider's compliance based on the compliance of its customers. It may be beneficial for large organizations to consider having staff become Internal Security Assessors (ISAs) and/or PCI Professionals (PCIPs). These PCI SSC qualifications provide individuals with training so that their organization has a better understanding of PCI DSS. Additionally, having ISAs and PCIPs within a large organization can assist when working with external PCI auditors and QSAs, and help support the correct application of PCI DSS controls within the organization. For more information about these programs, visit: https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/. 8.1 Defining Roles Because different roles within the organization have different responsibilities, roles may need different training content to match the tasks they perform. Examples of functional roles can include:  Customer service representative  Database administrator  Software developer  Product owner  Compliance manager These roles should be defined in a PCI DSS management process but identifying the functions undertaken will assist with training-program development. Having staff trained so that they understand the responsibility of others within the organization should be encouraged. The use of a matrix that describes specific responsibilities can assist staff significantly when issues with process or technology arise. Determining which roles need to know and be aware of these controls is critical for ensuring thorough awareness training. Examples could include security operations staff receiving additional training on “security detection and reporting” and the “PCI DSS compliance activities.” Information Supplement • PCI DSS for Large Organizations • February 2020 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

Examples of responsibilities are shown in Table 1– Common PCI DSS Roles & Responsibilities. PCI DSS training should be relevant to each role. For example, customer-support personnel involved only with the processing of credit cards over the phone would not require training on secure software development lifecycle requirements. Instead, their training should focus on requirements related to the definition of cardholder data, and how they should store and process this data. Conversely, a software developer would not need training on checking POS terminals for tampering or damage, but would need to receive training on secure software development principles. Focusing the training to what is required for the role will help prevent staff from being overwhelmed with information. The following sections provide examples of training topics for different roles. Customer-service Agents Customer-service agents often have limited rights and access, but very often handle payment card data directly. Agent training must accept the reality that personnel in this position often turn over very quickly and, therefore, training should focus on the essentials. For most customer-service environments, this means acknowledging the acceptable use of workstations, phones, and other computing resources available, as well as preventing physical access to these spaces by unauthorized personnel or adopting defenses against harmful software or other components from removable media. Managers or supervisors, particularly those who can access the historical screen or audio recordings containing cardholder data, should receive additional training on handling these data securely, disposing or not making copies locally, and awareness of phishing or other attacks that try to obtain access to the repositories to which managers and supervisors have access. Store Cashiers Store cashiers interact directly with customers and their payment cards and can act as the first line of defense for cardholder-present transactions. Having a training program focused around security at the point of sale (POS) is essential to protect cardholder data and detect fraud. Training should include how to inspect POS devices for tampering at the beginning of each shift, checking devices are physically secured, and looking for suspicious activity in areas where the public has access to payment terminals. Additionally, having store cashiers trained to detect equipment failure and unusual events can ensure the security of cardholder data is maintained. For example, staff trained in fallback procedures will know that a terminal falls back to magnetic stripe if a chip cannot be read, and that manual key entry should only occur if the magnetic stripe cannot be read. IT Administrators System, database, network administrators, and other staff with privileged access to computer systems will require more detailed security awareness training that includes understanding the importance of secure system configurations for the protection of sensitive information. In addition to the general security awareness training, further training may be necessary to address

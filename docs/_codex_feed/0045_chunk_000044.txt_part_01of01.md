AusPayNet’s 2020 Annual Review “Meeting the Challenge” provides an overview of our achievements over a challenging year. Some key highlights include: Industry responded quickly to COVID-19 including temporarily increasing the contactless PIN limit to help reduce physical contact with terminals. The industry consultation on the future of payment systems informed development of an Action Plan with a focus on modernisation and ensuring system efficiency. As the appointed central co-ordination body, we are leading the significant industry project to migrate the HVCS to ISO2002 Three work streams are supporting implementation of the TrustID framework: a governance structure for the framework, accreditation and a trust mark. We made submissions to regulators and Government including on the Review of Retail Payments Regulation, the Future Directions for the Consumer Data Right and Financial Technology and Regulatory Technology. Our December 2019 Payments Summit was the biggest ever, bringing together a record number of participants to explore emerging topics. We invite you to read our 2020 Annual Review below.

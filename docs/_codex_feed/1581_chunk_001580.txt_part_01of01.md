For example: “Tick this box to sign the declaration with the credentials you used to login and to authorise lodgement with your approved sending service provider’s AUSkey.” The user identifier must allow the AUSkey owner or an external auditor to uniquely identify the individual who made the declaration. The identifier used can be specified by the AUSkey owner providing it allows for the identification of the individual who made the declaration. Examples of suitable identifiers include a user login (userid), a full name, or an email address. A statement “Tick this box to sign this declaration” would not be acceptable as it does not identify the mechanism through which the individual is signing the declaration.

LIST OF VALIDATED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS NOTICE AND DISCLAIMER REGARDING LISTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS As part of its ongoing payment security initiatives, the PCI Security Standards Council (“PCI SSC”) makes available on its website various lists (each a “List”) of devices, components, software applications and other products and solutions (each a “Product or Solution”) that have been assessed by a third party for compliance against corresponding PCI SSC payment security standards (each a “Standard”). By clicking “ACCEPT” below, you will be able to access and search the Lists, and you thereby acknowledge and agree to the following: Only the specific version (or versions) of a given Product or Solution that is identified on a List has been evaluated and determined to comply with the applicable Standard. Compliance of a given Product or Solution with a Standard is determined SOLELY by the applicable PCI SSC-qualified assessor or laboratory (each an “Assessor”), based upon that Assessor’s assessment or evaluation of the Product or Solution, as documented in a corresponding validation report prepared by that Assessor. Although PCI SSC reviews such reports for Assessor quality assurance purposes, PCI SSC does not independently confirm the determinations, findings or information contained in Assessor reports and does not perform any testing or analysis of the corresponding Product or Solution, or related functionality, performance, suitability, or compliance with the applicable Standard. Each List and the content therein is provided "AS IS," and PCI SSC hereby expressly disclaims, and you waive, any and all representations and warranties of PCI SSC, express or implied, regarding the Lists, the content therein, and each Product or Solution, including but not limited to any implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, and any representation or warranty of title, non-infringement, or that any List, List content, Product or Solution will meet your requirements, be free of errors or malicious code, or be compatible with any other system, product, solution, service, component, or application. Each List and its content is subject to change by PCI SSC at any time, with or without notice. PCI SSC does not endorse or recommend, and the identification of a Product or Solution on a List does not constitute and should not be construed as an endorsement or recommendation of, any Product or Solution, or the vendor, developer, manufacturer, reseller, distributor or other provider thereof (each a “Vendor”). Although PCI SSC makes good faith efforts to provide accurate and complete information, anyone accessing or using a List or related content does so at their own sole risk and is solely responsible for confirming the accuracy of the information set forth therein, including but not limited to, confirming with the appropriate Vendor that the version of the Product or Solution identified on the List is in compliance with the applicable Standard. Use of a Product or Solution identified on a List does not guarantee or ensure compliance with any PCI SSC Standard or satisfy any obligation to perform independent evaluation and due diligence to ensure compliance with applicable PCI SSC Standards.

NPP Australia Limited has acknowledged with deep sympathy the passing of independent director Chloe Munro AO, following illness. Chloe joined NPP Australia’s Board in February 2018 and was appointed Chair of the Audit, Finance and Risk Committee and a member of the NPP Governance Committee. As an independent director of NPP Australia, Chloe brought deep intellect, extensive expertise and strategic insight combined with a forthright willingness to contribute her views. We were incredibly proud when Chloe was recognised as a nominee for the AFR 100 Women of Influence award for her leadership and contribution to public policy in Australia’s energy industry and the arts. NPPA Board directors, both past and present, have reflected on Chloe’s significant contribution. “Chloe was a remarkable director and a warm, engaging and supportive colleague. She will be missed,” said independent director Elizabeth Hallett. “I will remember Chloe’s passion and energy for taking on a new subject; but always in protecting the interests of the consumer and the market. Chloe was a tremendous asset to the Board and many others that she was active in,” said previous director Ian Povey. “Chloe’s fierce intellect and worldly perspective will be missed, as will her warmth and empathy. We are the poorer for her passing,” said current director Albert Naffah. While Chloe privately battled illness, she remained unflaggingly positive and a significant contributor to NPP Australia’s Board. We would like to formally acknowledge Chloe’s invaluable contribution to NPP Australia Limited during her time on our Board, and express deepest condolences to her family and friends.

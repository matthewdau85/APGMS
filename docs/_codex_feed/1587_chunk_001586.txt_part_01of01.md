submit a transmission as a batch of bulk payroll events. While not mandated, it probably makes most sense to only have one employer in a transmission (see submission guidelines in CMIG). • A technical focus group discussion also identified a concern that small lodgments (STP, PLS or Super) may get stuck behind a large STP lodgment. o The ATO was asked to consider making DSPs split large lodgments into smaller ones. o The concern being that SBR 2’s machine resources (CPU/ Memory/ etc) may be consumed on large lodgments. STP Service recover strategy– Main points to note UNCLASSIFIED – PAYEVNT Technical interactions - Clarification on Partial File Rejection, SLA, File Size, Recovery Strategy Single Touch Payroll Technical Committee (STPTC@ato.gov.au) 6th December 2017 11 • The ATO recognises some, but not all, lodgments can be held by the DSPs in the event of outages. o It is yet to be fully explored what options exist for the community to assist and not exacerbate the problems resulting from an outage. This is where external feedback on service availability may help. o The ATO is pursuing a “catch a file” approach, so that if all else fails, we can at least get the file and return the technical receipt. But as mentioned under partial file rejection, DSPs still need to cater for ATO unavailability and have the ability to resend. o DSPs are asked to consider the implication of their participation in this world of high volume exchange and consider things such as: restarting/ replaying lodgments, keeping various ids, persisting (potentially redundantly) keeping lodgements • The ATO is currently pursuing two courses of action: o Work to improve the availability of its solutions, including dependent systems. This includes tasks such as: parallel deployments to the cloud, upgrading databases to utilize “Always On Availability Group”, reviewing load balancing & DevOps processes, capacity planning, etc. o Work to address resilience – this is defined as minimizing impacts should availability problems occur. This includes: responding off cached data (where possible / appropriate), storing and holding lodgments until return to service, improved queuing strategy so requests always get through. • The ATO has engaged the services of a consultancy to prepare a program of work to address the above. It is recognised this is all just plan for a plan at the moment. It will take time for this program to deliver results. The ATO is focused on predicted STP workloads.

Once an individual has met all applicable SSF Qualification Requirements to be qualified as an Assessor-Employee, PCI SSC will add the Assessor-Employee to the applicable search tool on the Website. Only those SSF Assessor Companies and Assessor-Employees included on the SSF Assessor Company List or in such search tool (as applicable) as Secure SLC Assessors are recognized by PCI SSC to perform or support Secure SLC Assessments.

If, at any time, an SSF Assessor Company and/or Assessor-Employee does not meet the applicable SSF Requirements (including without limitation, payment or documentation requirements), PCI SSC reserves the right to remove the SSF Assessor Company and/or Assessor-Employee immediately from the respective list(s) or tool(s) on the Website, regardless of Remediation or Revocation. PCI SSC will notify the SSF Assessor Company of each such removal in accordance with the SSF Agreement, typically via registered or overnight mail and/or e-mail. Refer to Sections 6.2 and 6.3 below for additional information relating to Remediation and Revocation. 5.2 Annual Re-Qualification Requirements All SSF Assessor Companies must be re-qualified by PCI SSC on an annual basis.

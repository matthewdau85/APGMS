The Australian payments landscape has never been more vibrant and it’s for this reason that we have chosen the theme of ‘connections and collaboration’ for our annual report this year. As the number and nature of participants grows and diversifies, so does our role, requiring us to be nimble in outlook and collaborative in focus. In the last 12 months we have laid the foundation for our more connected future through a number of important initiatives. Whether giving rise to the next generation of commerce, shaping the New Payments Platform, ensuring the next wave of innovation, or supporting the Australian Payments Council, we have been at the forefront of change.

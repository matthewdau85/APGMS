entire process for a consumer to purchase petroleum, either outside at an unattended Fuel Island or inside at a POS Terminal. An ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SERVER (EPS) (may also be part of the Site Controller) is a software payment application, usually present in a semi-integrated system, that gives point- of-sale (POS) systems a way to perform payment transactions in a standard way, independent of the payment networks providing authorization. The EPS separates payment from the POS system or outdoor sales processor (OSP). The EPS manages payment requests from the POS systems and OSP, card data acquisition from the EMV terminals, and payment authorizations for all POS systems and the OSP. Generally, all payment business logic is implemented within the EPS. The POS, OSP, and EMV terminals being relatively “dumb” devices programmed to implement only the interface to/from the EPS. A FUEL SITE CONTROLLER is a software application designed to interface with the various forecourt devices of a fuel station, but primarily the fuel dispensers. The fuel site controller handles both physical and logical device control. Typically, it controls the device states, makes sure unauthorized state changes are prevented, and ensures processes follow regulations and specifications.

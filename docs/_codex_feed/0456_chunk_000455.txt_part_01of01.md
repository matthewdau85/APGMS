details in accordance with these Procedures, will ensure the smooth and efficient operation of each Framework Participant’s own SWIFT PDS System and the SWIFT PDS as a whole. (Note: The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) requires that certain information must be included in electronic funds transfer instructions and that certain information must be obtained in respect of those instructions before financial institutions may initiate, pass on or take any other action to carry out the electronic funds transfer instructions. Please refer to Part 5 of the Act for details.)287 8.2 Message Preparation Guidelines Message preparation guidelines, designed to assist in the straight through processing of SWIFT PDS payments, are set out in Annexure I. The guidelines are not mandatory, as they exceed normal SWIFT requirements, but are strongly recommended as a means of maximising the level of automation available within Framework Participants’ own systems. 8.3 BSB Number (a) To use the SWIFT PDS each Framework Participant must have a BSB Number which will represent the ultimate destination for delivery of payments to that Framework Participant. (b) If an Applicant has not already been allocated a BSB Number by the Company because of its participation in another Framework (which BSB Number is also valid for the HVCS upon notification to AusPayNet to activate that BSB Number for the HVCS), that Applicant must request allocation of a BSB Number from the Company when applying to join the HVCS. 8.4 Repair Routing Code BSB All Framework Participants must assign one BSB Number, to be known as the Repair Routing Code BSB, to which Framework Participants may direct payments if details of the intended recipient Framework Participant are known but there is insufficient information available to precisely identify the beneficiary’s branch. Each Framework Participant must advise the Company of its Repair Routing Code 287 Inserted effective 30/4/07, version 022 r&p 001.17 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES PART 8: SWIFT PDS MESSAGE CONTENT SPECIFICATIONS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 59 BSB, which can be an existing BSB Number, by completing a “BSB and BIC Amendment Advice” available from the Company. 8.5 BIC/BSB Relationship All authorised HVCS BSB Numbers must be linked to Framework Participant’s BIC or BICs, where multiple BICs have been defined, and will be recorded in the Company’s publication “HVCS BIC/BSB Directory”. Each Framework Participant must ensure that the BIC and BSB Numbers included in SWIFT PDS payments sent by it conform to the approved arrangements as set out in the “HVCS BIC/BSB Directory”. 8.6 FIN-Copy Service Code Identifier (a) SWIFT use an identification code called the FIN-Copy Service Code Identifier to uniquely identify the various FIN-Copy services operating within the SWIFT Network internationally. (b) The characters “PDS” will be the FIN Copy Service Code Identifier for the SWIFT PDS. Framework Participants must ensure that their SWIFT PDS Systems are configured to set Field 103 in the User Header Block 3 to “PDS” for all SWIFT PDS (MT103, MT202 and their variants).288 8.7 Character Set Normal SWIFT Character Set requirements, as set out in the SWIFT User Handbook, will apply for all SWIFT PDS payments. 8.8 Transaction Reference Number (TRN) (a) Framework Participants are responsible for ensuring that all SWIFT PDS payments contain a unique Transaction Reference Number (“TRN”) (Field 20), and that the TRN is unique within any given fourteen (14) day period. Where a Framework Participant uses multiple Logical Terminals (LT) it must ensure the uniqueness of its TRNs across all LTs. (b) All TRNs are a maximum of 16 alpha-numeric characters in length. (c) To ensure the uniqueness of TRNs across individual high value systems (HVCS, RITS, Austraclear System), it has been agreed with the operators of these other high value systems that all RITS and Austraclear System TRNs will commence with a four character alpha identifier. The RITS TRN alpha identifier will be “RITS” while the Austraclear System identifier will be “ACLR”.289 (d) SWIFT PDS messages will not require a TRN alpha identifier but Framework Participants must ensure that they exclude the use of “RITS” and “ACLR” alpha characters from the first four digits of their SWIFT PDS TRN generation routine. 288 Last amended effective 21/11/09, version 029 r&p 003.09 289 Last amended effective 18/4/05, version 015 r&p 001.15 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES PART 8: SWIFT PDS MESSAGE CONTENT SPECIFICATIONS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 60 (e) Where a message is to be re-sent as the result of the original message being rejected by RITS, the Sender of the message to be re-sent must assign a new TRN to the re-sent message.290 8.9 Value Date (a) Framework Participants may input payments for same day value or otherwise in accordance with Clause 5.12(a). RITS will ascertain the payment value date from the value date contained within the Amount Field (Field 32A) in the payment message.291 (b) Where a Framework Participant inputs a payment with a value date more than 5 Settlement Days in advance of the input date, RITS will reject the payment and SWIFT FIN-Copy will return an Abort Notification (MT019) to the Sender advising the reason for that rejection. Framework Participants should note that payments may only be entered as Future Dated Payments strictly in accordance with Clause 5.12(a).292 8.10 Currency Framework Participants may only send payments denominated in Australian dollars.

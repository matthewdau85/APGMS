implemented that will protect the Provider's infrastructure as well as Customers’ data. For PCI DSS validated Providers, the AOC should include a list of all physical locations that were evaluated as part of the PCI DSS compliance validation. In a private cloud, the physical location of all components is known and can be verified. When using a public cloud, different elements of the environment, such as VMs, hypervisors, virtual network devices, etc., could be Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

Verifying that appropriate physical security is in place can be challenging in an environment where data and infrastructure can be in multiple different locations at different times. A Customer should seek assurance that its physical security requirements are consistently applied across all potential locations. 6.3 Data Security Considerations The following diagram shows a typical representation of the data life cycle:16 Figure 3. The typical data life cycle It is important to identify and define the data used and produced in your environment and how the security aspects are managed all along its life cycle. For all cloud service categories, clear requirements for data retention, storage and secure disposal should form an integral part of the engagement process to ensure that sensitive data is: ▪ Retained for as long as needed ▪ Not retained any longer than needed ▪ Stored only in appropriate and secured locations ▪ Accessible only to those with a business need ▪ Handled in accordance with the Customer’s security policy 6.3.1 Data Acquisition The Customer will ultimately determine how and when the cardholder data is acquired in the cloud environment. End-to-end processes and data flows must be documented across both Customer and Provider networks, so that it is clearly understood where cardholder data is located and how it is traversing the infrastructure (see PCI DSS Requirement 1.1.2). This will also help the Customer and Provider to identify where each entity acquires and relinquishes cardholder data throughout the process. 16 Cloud Security Alliance, Security Guidance for Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud Computing V4.0 (Cloud Security Alliance, 2017). https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/download/security-guidance-v4.

A defined data classification system can help organizations identify data that is sensitive or confidential, and data with specific security needs. This in turn allows organizations to assign appropriate protection mechanisms based on the security needs of different data types, and helps to prevent sensitive data from being inadvertently mishandled or treated as non-sensitive. 6.3.1.2 Migration to a Cloud Environment It is recommended that data security needs be evaluated for all types of information being migrated to a cloud environment, not only cardholder data. For example, operational data, security policies and procedures, system configurations and build standards, log files, audit reports, authentication credentials, cryptographic keys, incident response plans and employee contact details are just some of the types of data with different security requirements that may need to be considered. If data security processes are not clearly defined and documented, the data may be unintentionally exposed or subject to unnecessary risk that could result in loss or inappropriate disclosure. 6.3.1.3 Data Sovereignty and Legal Considerations Depending on the deployment model and cloud service category adopted, and due to the dynamic nature of cloud operations, it may not be known where particular information actually resides. This may result in concerns over data ownership and potential conflicts between domestic or international legal and regulatory requirements. For example, the Provider’s infrastructure may result in data traversing or being stored in politically or economically unstable countries, or being subject to regional regulations. Understanding the legal jurisdictions that apply to data in different countries or regions can be a challenge for the Customer. For example, Customers subject to regional laws restricting cross-border flows of data will need to verify all locations and flows of their data to ensure that their cloud services are compliant with their legal obligations. Other legal considerations include requirements for electronic discovery, evidence preservation and integrity, and data custody. Providers should have documented processes for responding to legal requests for seizure of records, including data/audit logs belonging to the Provider and its Customers. Customers should understand the ramifications of such laws in the countries where their data exists, as well as the processes in which their Provider will engage. Further to the data sovereignty considerations mentioned above, public Providers often have multiple data storage systems located in multiple data centers, which may often be in multiple countries or regions. Consequently, the Customer may not know the location of its data, or the data may exist in one or more of several locations at any particular time. Additionally, a Customer may have little or no visibility into the controls protecting its stored data. This can make validation of data security and access controls for a specific data set particularly challenging. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent

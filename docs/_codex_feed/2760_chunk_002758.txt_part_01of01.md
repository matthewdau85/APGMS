Page 1 1 Introduction These PCI Software Security Framework Qualification Requirements for Assessors are intended for companies and their employees wishing to qualify to perform assessments under the PCI Software Security Framework (SSF) and describe the minimum capability and related documentation requirements that candidate SSF Assessor Companies and their Assessor-Employees must satisfy. The SSF is a collection of software security standards and associated validation and listing programs developed, maintained and operated by PCI SSC, for the secure design, development and maintenance of payment software. The SSF comprises the following software security standards (each a “SSF Standard”), each of which is available through the Website: PCI Secure Software Lifecycle (Secure SLC) Standard PCI Secure Software Standard Companies and their employees may choose to qualify to perform assessments using the PCI Secure SLC Standard, the PCI Secure Software Standard, or both. • The Secure SLC Standard provides a baseline of requirements with corresponding assessment procedures and guidance to help payment software vendors design, develop, and maintain secure payment software throughout the software lifecycle. Secure Software Core Requirements apply to all types of payment software submitted for validation under the PCI Software Security Framework, regardless of the software’s functionality or underlying technology • Module A – Account Data Protection applies to payment applications that store, process, or transmit cardholder data (CHD) and/or sensitive authentication data (SAD). Note: PCI SSC will publish additional modules for the Secure Software Standard (Module A and each such additional module, a “Module”), and will update the SSF Qualification Requirements to address such additional Modules or other matters, at any time and from time to time.

that relate to one bulk file which will be important in the adoption of the NPP for large bulk files. Developing a standard payment instruction format: At present, an ABA file or some form of alternative proprietary payment instruction format is used by digital service providers and other end users for processing transactions through BECS. These file formats have been designed around the BECS system and are limited to the specific features of a BECS payment. To help with integration and reduce bespoke arrangements, AP+ is working with Participants and the industry to develop a standard payment instruction format for NPP payments to replace these existing file formats. This will help facilitate Participants, payment service providers and the wider ecosystem in building payment offerings to receive or distribute transactions that deliver a standard and consistent experience for both payers and payees. ​ In our discussions with the DSPANZ payments working group in particular, we’ve heard that this format would be of significant value. Our intent is to further consult with industry and end users on these proposed enhancements in the coming months. 2. Upgrading NPP’s ISO 20022 messaging for global alignment The NPP’s payment messaging framework is built on ISO 20022, the global standard for payments information exchange. Since its initial design in 2014, the version used by the NPP has remained largely unchanged, while significant enhancements have been made to the ISO standard globally. To stay aligned with international developments and other ISO 20022-based systems in Australia, the NPP will be upgraded to a more recent version, with a target delivery date of December 2026. The upgrade will: Support the use of new data elements which will enable greater functionality and efficiency, including facilitating reduced manual handling and greater capacity to deal with errors and security risks. Improve compatibility with global financial systems, enabling smoother international transactions. The version upgrade will allow for NPP message harmonisation that is aligned with global initiatives, including the G20 commitments plus domestic initiatives like proposed Payday Super legislation. 3. Designing a service to more efficiently process large volumes of bulk payments The NPP was designed to process single payments line-by-line rather than batching a number of payments together, as occurs on BECS today. This approach was taken to facilitate real-time processing and support the efficiencies that can be delivered from the ability to isolate individual payment issues. Businesses migrating bulk payments to the NPP have options available: Many bulk files contain only a small number of payments that can be ‘debulked’ by banks and processed as single NPP payments. The shift to APIs and more continuous payment processing means that many bulk files can transition to the NPP using this more modern method. Both approaches are being used today as businesses start to migrate their payments to the NPP. For those bulk payments for which the above solutions are not ideal, AP+ has received industry feedback that a standard approach to processing these bulk payments across the platform would help facilitate migration. Over the past 9 months, AP+ has consulted and collaborated with industry to determine how to best solve for processing large volumes of bulk payments on the NPP. At the end of 2024, industry agreed that there was merit in proceeding to detailed design to further elaborate on the development of a new business service which would enable multiple transactions to be contained within a single payment message (‘multi-credit transfer’ message) and processed across the platform. Detailed design work will occur during 2025 and will include engagement and consultation with a range of end users and stakeholders as part of that process. 4. Ensuring sufficient capacity for future NPP payment growth As payments shift to the NPP, AP+ has planned capacity uplifts, backed by detailed volumetric modelling, to support higher transaction volumes and ensure seamless processing. AP+ completed an initial NPP capacity uplift in December 2023, with the next uplift scheduled for December 2025 to accommodate anticipated volume increases as a result of payments migrating from BECS more broadly, including preparing for higher volumes driven by the implementation of proposed Payday super legislation. These capacity uplifts ensure that the NPP has more than sufficient headroom to deal with processing peaks as well as uplifting processing throughput. Current and planned capacity vs average payments per second (PPS) Source: AP+ volumetric modelling. Forecast PPS based on AP+ assumptions on future growth rates and forecasted volumes. In parallel, many NPP Participants are enhancing their infrastructure by leveraging cloud technology. Moving key NPP infrastructure components to the cloud enables scalability, cost efficiency, and improved resilience, in particular helping Participants manage peak processing periods such as Christmas and Easter. AP+ is working closely with its vendor SWIFT and Participants to deliver a cloud-based solution for the relevant components of the NPP infrastructure, whilst ensuring the NPP remains robust and adaptable as transaction volumes grow. The target date for this capability to be ready for adoption by Participants is May 2026. 5. Connecting all relevant accounts to send and receive NPP payments Over 114 million accounts - about 87% of BECS-reachable accounts held by NPP participating organisations – can now receive NPP payments (as at 30 September 2024), an increase of 12% year on year 1 . NPP Participants have plans to enable another ~ 13 million accounts over the next 2-3 years and aim to connect nearly all the remaining BECS-reachable accounts before BECS is retired. Most currently

Work-related expenses (WRE) schedule disabled for Tax Time 2020 returns Original Published Date 31/01/2020 - 2:15pm Description The WRE schedule for individual tax returns (also known as Schedule W) will be disabled and not accepted in Tax Time 2020 or later returns. Summary of changes With the successful deployment of the Deduction schedule at Tax Time 2019, the WRE schedule is no longer required. The Deduction schedule is mandatory for all individual tax returns where deductions are being claimed and it will collect most of the data that was previously requested on the WRE schedule. If any additional information is needed, it will be gathered during the audit and review process. Therefore, for 2020 returns and later, the WRE schedule will no longer be accepted as part of lodgment and ATO staff will not request the provision of this schedule as part of an audit or review process.

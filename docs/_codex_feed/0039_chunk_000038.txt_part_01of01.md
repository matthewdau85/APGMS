to date. Conversely, AES is well established and supported by a wide range of technology providers. This means that the upgrade to AES would be a far simpler and well understood task than adoption of whole new standards. Do you need to upgrade ATMs given the decline in cash? It is important to upgrade all points of access to the Card Payments System. ATMs are considered essential infrastructure, especially for rural and remote communities in Australia, regardless of their declining usage, and ongoing support for cash as a payment method is a necessity. However, the rationale for the upgrade is not related to the decline in ATM usage. The upgrade is necessary to ensure that ATM transactions remain secure and protected against potential security threats. Making ATMs more secure may include replacing or upgrading the devices that protect PIN data when an ATM machine is used, installing new devices to improve security, and updating the ATM’s software and hardware. Will PINs and card numbers become obsolete soon? If so, why do we need to do this? The migration to AES with Key Blocks is substantially driven by the need to enhance the security of card payments and protect sensitive information, such as cardholder data and PINs. The decline in the usage of PINs and the emergence of other technologies (e.g. digital wallets) does not change the rationale for this project, as these technologies may not be suitable for all payment scenarios.

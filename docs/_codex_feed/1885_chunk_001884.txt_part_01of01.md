treatment of data, thereby making it easier for third parties to utilise the platform’s capabilities. This activity, combined with the work on APIs, is intended to support the growth of business use and commercial payment volumes on the platform. NPP Functionality The NPP has extensive capabilities today, in particular: Real-time movement of funds , 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days of the year with no cut-off times; Extensive data capabilities with the ability to carry additional data end-to-end together with the payment with the ISO 20022 message structure or via a url link to externally hosted documents. The initial service launched on the NPP, Osko, is capable of carrying up to 280 characters of remittance information; Real-time line-by-line settlement which reduces systemic risk and optimises liquidity management; and Simple addressing with the PayID Addressing Service which enables payments to be directed to an account using an easy to remember alias (a PayID) which has been linked to an underlying bank account. The platform also continues to support payments using BSB and account numbers. The NPP has been designed and built in a way that it can meet the needs of an evolving digital economy with additional functionality and capability being delivered over time to further enhance the utility of the platform. Planned capability developments include: Future iterations of the Osko service which will include “request to pay” functionality and the ability to attach a document with a payment or have a url link to externally hosted documents included in the message; A central ‘consent and mandate service’, which is in the early stages of development, in collaboration with the industry, which will store payment authorisations by consumers and businesses. This is intended to enable the platform to support recurring payments linked to a customer consent or mandate authorising those payments as an alternative to the current direct debit process. This capability is also intended to be able to support a range of use cases including third party payment initiation and ecommerce, amongst others; Use of the NPP to remit the inbound domestic leg of a cross-border payment Summary The view of NPPA is that the access framework for the NPP, balances fair and equitable access to a range of parties in various ways, with safeguards to ensure the safety and security of the payments system and the ongoing protection of deposit-holders. Over time, the number of organisations using the NPP will only continue to grow, with expected broad representation from financial institutions, corporates and fintechs. Similarly, as occurred following the creation of the new class of entity, Restricted ADI licences, NPPA will continue to review and refine its operational procedures, regulations, including those concerning access, in line with experience, feedback and market developments. Given the underlying native capabilities of the NPP in terms of speed, reach, extended availability, addressing features, governance and processing rules, settlement model, and enhanced data capability, NPPA is confident that the NPP is capable of meeting most organisations’ business objectives and use cases today. Even so, NPPA is committed to ongoing investment in and extending the capability of the platform in order to meet the needs of participating financial institutions, payment providers and users of the wider payments ecosystem over time.

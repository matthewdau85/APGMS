Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments. CPMI has established the Payments Interoperability and Extension (PIE) Taskforce . This will bring together firms that offer cross-border payment services, payment system operators and relevant industry associations. The PIE Taskforce should provide a source of expert advice and a mechanism for collaboration on the provision and enhancement of cross-border payment arrangements. It should also serve as a forum for the exchange of implementation experiences and coordination between public authorities and private sector stakeholders. FSB has established the Legal, Regulatory, and Supervisory Matters (LRS) Taskforce . This will bring together firms that offer cross-border payment services, payment system operators and relevant industry associations with significant experience and responsibilities in compliance, legal, risk management and cross-border payment operations. The LRS Taskforce will provide input and feedback on frictions in legal, regulatory or supervisory frameworks related to the provision of cross-border payments and relevant data-related frameworks. The FSB also published its Final Report, ' Developing the Implementation Approach for the Cross-Border Payments Targets ', in November 2022. While the targets remain unchanged - as set out in Appendix 1 - the FSB has flagged adjustments to the definition of wholesale and retail market segments. The adjustment is to include all payments above a certain value in the wholesale market, regardless of the type of end-user involved. The value threshold will be published by the FSB at a later date. Taking the roadmap forward We note APEC's continuing interest in supporting cross-border payments and remittances, as set out in the Chair's Statement of the 29th APEC Finance Ministers' Meeting , which was held in Bangkok, Thailand in October 2022. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), CPMI, BIS Innovation Hub, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Group published a paper on ' Exploring multilateral platforms for cross-border payments ' in January 2023. It provides an analysis of the potential costs and benefits of existing and potentially new platforms and how they might alleviate some of the cross-border payment frictions. It also evaluates the risks, barriers, and challenges to establishing multilateral platforms, and explores two paths for their organic evolution, which are: increasing the role of existing multilateral platforms, and increased public sector involvement in overcoming risk and barriers to the creation of new multilateral platforms. CPMI and FSB Milestones for 2023 We look forward to working with you through 2023.

AP+ held its latest Payment Service Provider Forum on 10 July 2023. Chaired by Greg Cooper, independent AP+ director, the forum considered updates from the business and retail payments teams and provided input into Treasury consultations. AP+ is taking a proactive role in supporting the migration of BECS volumes across to the NPP by undertaking a comprehensive programme of work focussed on the readiness of the NPP, NPP Participant, and the broader ecosystem. AP+ members and the broader ecosystem will be required to migrate Direct Entry payment volume to an alternative payment channel as a result of the impending closure of the BECS framework. An update on PayTo covered the go-live status of NPP participants; initiation volumes ramping up as more participants go live and a PayTo campaign summary. Work on development of the next generation of BPAY was discussed. BPAY is a trusted payment method for Australians to pay their bills safely and securely. It’s used by 11 million Australians, with 65,000 billers. Fraud and Assurance Frameworks were also examined. AP+ is extending existing expertise and capabilities in fraud prevention, network surveillance, chargebacks, and dispute management across the different payment rails that AP+ operates. On retail payments, a high-level timeline for the development and full commercialisation of AP+ online tokenisation solution is underway. This is in line with the proposed expectations from the RBA. On Merchant Choice Routing, the RBA expects industry stakeholders to collaborate and implement solutions for mobile MCR by end-2024. AP+ is well progressed with these plans, working closely with Issuers, Acquirers and mobile handset operators on implementation plans. A main topic on the agenda was input from PSP Forum members upon Treasury consultations on Reforms to the Payment Systems Regulations Act 1998 and licensing of payment service providers.

exist and are followed to ensure that when a key is installed under dual control using key components that these key components or key shares are only combined within a SCD.135 Reference ISO 11568, clause 4.10.2; PCI PIN SR 12-4.136 Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (g) Key components are combined to form a key by a process such that no active bit of the key could be determined without knowledge of all components. Key components are combined using one of the following functions:137 XOR and/or Encryption 133 Last amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 134 Last amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 135 Last amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 136 Last amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 137 Last amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 1 - INTRODUCTION AND MEMBER OBLIGATIONS ANNEXURE A ANNUAL SECURITY AUDITS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 48 Key share are combined to form a key by a process such that no active bit of the key could be determined without knowledge of m of n key shares. Reference ISO 11568, clause 4.1.2; PCI PIN SR 12-4.138 Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (h) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure when in secure transit, cleartext key components are protected from compromise in one of the following manners:139 Key components are transported in separate tamper-evident packaging; or Key components are transported in a device meeting the requirements of a Secure Cryptographic Devic. Reference ISO 11568, clause 4.1.2; PCI PIN SR 12-4.140 Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (i) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure a cleartext key component is:141 Under the supervision of a person authorised by management with access to this component; or Locked in a security container in such a way that can be obtained only by a person with authorized access; or In secure transit; or In a Secure Cryptographic Device. 138 Amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 139 Last amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 140 Amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 141 Last amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 1 - INTRODUCTION AND MEMBER OBLIGATIONS ANNEXURE A ANNUAL SECURITY AUDITS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 49 Reference ISO 11568, clause 4.10.2, Annex B; PCI PIN SR 13-5. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (j) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure if keys are loaded or transported using an electronic key loading device then:142 The key loading device is a device approved by an Approved Standard Entity with an Accepted Standard;143 The key loading device is under the supervision of a person authorised by management, or is stored in a secure manner (e.g., in a safe) such that no unauthorised person may have access to it; and The key loading device is designed or controlled so that only authorised personnel under dual control can utilise and enable it to output a key into another SCD. Such personnel ensure that the transfer is not being monitored, e.g., that there is no key recording device inserted between the SCDs. Reference IAC Code Set Vol 1, Clause 3.1(c); ISO 13491.2, clause F.3. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (k) Documented procedures exist and are followed to protect the transfer of a key, key component or key share into SCMs so as to prevent the disclosure of the key, key components or key shares. Examples of procedures include physical inspection of the SCD equipment to detect evidence of monitoring and dual custody of the loading process.144 142 Last amended effective 1/1/25, version 015 r&p 003.23 143 Amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 144 Last amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 1 - INTRODUCTION AND MEMBER OBLIGATIONS ANNEXURE A ANNUAL SECURITY AUDITS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 50 Reference ISO 11568, clause 4.10.2, Annex B; PCI PIN SR 14. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (l) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure that a key exists at only the minimal number of locations consistent with the operation of the system (e.g., including disaster recovery purposes, dual processing sites).145 Reference ISO 11568, clauses 4.1.6 and 4.11.2. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (m) If for archival purposes, reconstruction of a given key is required at a later date, procedures exist and are followed to ensure the key is retained in a manner such as to preclude it being intentionally used again as active keying material.146 Reference ISO 11568, 4.16. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason 145 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 146 Last amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 1 - INTRODUCTION AND MEMBER OBLIGATIONS ANNEXURE A ANNUAL SECURITY AUDITS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 51 (n) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure a key shared between communicating parties is not shared between any other communicating parties.147 Reference ISO 11568, 4.11.1; PCI PIN SR 17-1.148 Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (o) Procedures exist and are followed to ensure a key, key component or key share that has been used for a cryptographic purpose is erased or destroyed when it is no longer required using approved destruction procedures.149 Reference ISO 11568, 4.14; PCI PIN

Special orders can also be made by contacting the current print on demand provider, LitSupport (TIMG) on 07 3223 9202 or by email . How to order individual titles - Australian Customers If a printed copy is able to be ordered a "Order print copy" button is available at the document level. This button is located next to the "View as made version" button and highlighted below. Copies are printed from the authorised version in black and white, and will generally appear as they do on screen (so some older documents may be printed with speckles or slightly out of square). Copies are produced as either A4 or B5 size, depending on the size of the original document, with a cardboard cover and stapled or perfect bound. To ensure that the cost remains as low as possible, standard covers are produced in black and white and they will only have the title on the spine if they are 144 pages or more. There are a number of options available at an additional cost and these options can be selected when placing an order. Coloured covers and artwork can be ordered by contacting the Print on Demand provider directly. Payment can be made via a secure online payment site with Visa, MasterCard or by invoice.

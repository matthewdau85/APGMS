nominal theoretical waveform for that character, with the peak(s) used for measurement of signal strength noted. All relate to the reference peak for the Domestic symbol that is rated at 100. These waveforms are mathematically derived from a theoretical model based on the design of the MICR tester defined in ANSI X9-27 and ideal MICR characters. These characters have perfect edges and dimensions, completely uniform ink cover and the magnetisation is parallel to the plane of the paper. These waveforms are not specified as standards because commercially available test equipment and printed MICR documents cannot conform exactly to the model. These is however sufficiently good correlation between the model and actual waveforms for them to be a very useful tool in examining the quality of MICR. The signal strength derived from the reference peaks is definitely defined as a standard and is shown in the table below together with the high and low tolerance levels at 75% to 200% of the nominal. Printed documents must conform to these tolerance limits.

Accreditation of MICR Printing Systems Amended, effective 15/09/06 1.1 Definitions "Applicant" means: (a) In the case of an Original System the manufacturer of that Original System, or their agent and (b) In the case of a Modified System the person, or entity, who owns that Modified Printing System. "Modified System" means a Printing System in which some or all of the components of that Printing System have been modified or customised for the owner of that Printing System, so that it operates in a manner different to that produced by the manufacturer. "Printing System" means a system of Printing Technology that is claimed to be suitable for printing MICR documents, with components that may include a print engine, magnetic toner, operating system, Page Description Language (PDL) and version of the El3B font. Systems such as those used for proof encoding, and that print MICR, are classed as Printing Systems. "Printing Technology" means the printing process used for printing MICR documents. The major technologies are:  Letterpress  Wet Offset  Impact or Ribbon transfer  Non-Impact - Laser - Light Emitting Diode (LED) - Magnetographic - Electron Beam (formerly ion deposition) "Original System" means a Printing System as produced by a manufacturer. 1.2 Objectives Amended, effective 15/09/06 In order to protect the efficiency of the clearing system, it is important to monitor the use of Printing Systems so as to attempt to reduce the amount of poor quality documents entering the system. A testing procedure has been developed which leads to the accreditation and registration of Printing Systems that can reliably produce MICR documents of an acceptable quality. The aim is that the accreditation procedures can be relied upon by APCS Framework Participants as evidence of capacity to provide MICR encoding of an acceptable standard. Accreditation indicates that a Printing System, when operated in accordance with the Applicant's specifications, is capable of producing acceptable MICR encoding and has passed tests for accreditation of MICR Printing Systems as detailed below. However, due to manufacturing and/or operating variances, accreditation is not a guarantee that an individual Printing System will produce acceptable results. Accreditation is subject to ongoing evaluation, refer to section 1.9 of this Appendix. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 63 AusPayNet September 2017 1.3 Summary of the Process Amended, effective 15/09/06 The Applicant begins the accreditation process by providing an application for testing to AusPayNet. The form of application is outlined in section 1.4 of this Appendix and must include the results of bench testing performed on the Printing System and/or evidence of all existing accreditations claimed by the Applicant in respect of the Printing System. AusPayNet will review the application and, if necessary, may request further information from the Applicant. Once an application is accepted, field testing takes place at the data centres of various Tier 1A Participating Members selected by AusPayNet. The results of the field testing are then reviewed by AusPayNet and AusPayNet will decide whether, on the basis of the results, the Printing System is capable of reliably producing MICR documents of an acceptable standard. The Applicant will be informed of AusPayNet’s decision and will have a right of re- test. AusPayNet may, in its absolute discretion, accept existing accreditations with other bodies as meeting part or all of the requirements of the accreditation process.

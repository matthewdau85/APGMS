How you create and manage alerts in your My Account has changed. All of your existing alerts and any searches you have created and saved are unaffected by these changes and will continue to work as you have set them up. We have updated the user interface for creating alerts in My Account to provide you with greater control over what you will be alerted about. These changes include more options for specific events. The guidance below takes you through the options in detail (see in particular Create and save an alert ). We have also standardised language from subscription to alert and updated the alert email format based on feedback received from you, our users.

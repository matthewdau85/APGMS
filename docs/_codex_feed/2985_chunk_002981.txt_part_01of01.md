OSboth parties will need to clarify which entity is applying secure configuration and hardening at the OS level. Applications and software above the OS are likely to be controlled by the Customer. Secure configuration of network devices will be managed by the Provider. SaaS: The Provider typically manages configuration and hardening of all devices, OS and applications. Customer and Provider Customer and Provider Provider Requirement 3: Protect stored cardholder data. IaaS and PaaS: The Customer is generally responsible for the manner in which information is secured (such as the use of encryption mechanisms) and in what formatfor example, flat files, database entries, etc. Physical locations of the information stores might be unknown to the Customer, and storage locations may need to be identified. Data retention is defined by the Customer; however, the Provider controls the actual storage areas. The use of controls to prevent unintended or additional retention (for example, via snapshots, backups, etc.) also needs to be considered. SaaS: Stored cardholder data is typically controlled and managed by the Provider as part of the predefined service. The Provider may also define the retention periods. Customers may have very little to no control over how or where their data, including CHD, is stored. Customer and Provider Customer and Provider Provider Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 45 PCI DSS Requirements Common Considerations Example Responsibility Assignment for Management of Controls IaaS PaaS SaaS Requirement 4: Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks. IaaS and PaaS: Mechanisms for transmission are typically controlled by the Customer, while the underlying technology is managed by the Provider; however, this will depend on the technologies in use. Controls to prevent unintended transmission of data outside the Customer environment are generally maintained by the Provider, depending on the particular service. The Customer should be aware of how data is transmitted between components in order to ensure that data is encrypted for all transmissions over non-private channels. This may include transmissions within the Customer’s own environment (for example, between Customer VMs). SaaS: The Provider retains full control over transmission mechanisms. The Customer has little to no control over how or where data is transmitted within the cloud environment. The Customer is responsible for ensuring that clear-text data is not passed to the Provider for transmission to public networks or untrusted environments (such as other cloud Customers). Customer Customer and Provider Provider Requirement 5: Protect all systems against malware and regularly update anti-virus software or programs. IaaS: Protection of the OS and Customer VMs is typically the responsibility of the Customer. Anti-virus updates apply to the host OS as well as to any VMs in the Customer environment running their own OS. There may also be virtual devices that the Customer is responsible for keeping up to date. Anti-malware protection for underlying devices/infrastructure remains the responsibility of the Provider. It is important to confirm that the selected anti-virus solution used by the Customer is compatible with the underlying infrastructure managed by the Provider. PaaS: Anti-malware protection is generally managed by whoever controls the OS; some PaaS services include Customer responsibility for OS maintenance. Anti-virus updates will apply to the underlying OS as well as to any VMs in the Customer environment running their own OS. SaaS: The Provider typically manages the security and anti-virus for the environment.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 46 PCI DSS Requirements Common Considerations Example Responsibility Assignment for Management of Controls IaaS PaaS SaaS Requirement 6: Develop and maintain secure systems and applications. IaaS: Patching and maintenance of OS and applications are typically the responsibility of the Customer, while patching and maintenance of underlying devices remains the responsibility of the Provider. There may also be virtual devices that the Customer is responsible for maintaining. Secure coding is typically the Customer's responsibility (it may either use its own applications or choose secure commercial applications). PaaS: Patching and maintenance of underlying devices remain the responsibility of the Provider. OS patching and maintenance may also be controlled by the Provider; however, some PaaS services include Customer responsibility for OS maintenance: entities will need to determine which party is responsible for applying patches/updates. If the Provider provides patching, the Customer should verify that patches are deployed in a timely manner. Patching of applications is typically managed by the Customer, depending on the service and agreements. Secure coding of applications is the responsibility of whoever develops/controls the applications, which may be either the Customer or the Provider, and may vary for different applications. SaaS: The Customer may control or manage the APIs, or it may share responsibility with the Provider. The Provider typically manages patching and updates of all devices, OS and applications, and is also responsible for secure coding of software; however, the Customer should verify that patches are deployed in a timely manner. Customer and Provider Customer and Provider Customer and Provider Requirement 7: Restrict access to cardholder data by business need to know. IaaS and PaaS: Generally, the Customer is responsible for defining access to its data files. Physical location of the information stores might be unknown

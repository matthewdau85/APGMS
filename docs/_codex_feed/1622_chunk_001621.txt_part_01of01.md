Coinciding with International Day of People with Disability, on 3 December 2019 we released Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals , designed to make it easier for people living with vision and/or motor impairments to make payments on point-of-sale (POS) touchscreens. The Guidelines are the first in the world to address access to POS touchscreen technology and are a key step in efforts to ensure innovations in payments technology are accessible to the widest population. The Guidelines are available on the links below. For further information, please contact us at accessibility@auspaynet.com.au .

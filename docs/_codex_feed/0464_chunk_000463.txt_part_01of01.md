Copies of the System Certification Checklist are available from the Company and can be obtained from the SWIFT PDS Operations Manager. The System Certification Checklist has been designed to assist applicants and particularly audit personnel to ensure that all requirements have been met. The System Certification Checklist is divided into a number of self-contained sections, each detailing a range of requirements cross-referenced to the relevant Clause of the HVCS Procedures. Each item in the System Certification Checklist requires a simple positive (tick) or negative (cross) response. Should a particular item require clarification or the provision of additional data, comment or information can be included at the foot of each section or a separate advice provided and attached to the System Certification Checklist. If any clarification or additional information is required, regarding the certification process, applicants should contact the SWIFT PDS Operations Manager. The System Certification Checklist must be completed and signed by a duly authorised officer for and on behalf of the Applicant. The actual commencement date for a new Framework Participant is designated by the Management Committee at the time the membership application is approved. However, where the applicant has a preferred launch date, the completed System Certification Checklist and the related test results will need to be provided to the Company no less than four weeks prior to that date. A.1.1 Certification Testing It is strongly recommended that Framework Participants perform certification testing on both their primary and backup configurations but it is recognised that this may cause difficulties for some members where an existing production environment is being utilised. If this is the case a Framework Participant may complete its certification on a similar configuration such as a test system. Where this occurs it is expected that the test configuration will closely replicate the live environment, details of which will be provided to AusPayNet as part of the Certification Test Factsheet. A hardcopy of the test results are not required except in those cases where the actual test result differs from the expected result in which case the requirements of Clause 7.27(d) apply. 375 Last amended effective 20/11/06, version 021 r&p 003.06 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE A: CERTIFICATION CHECKLIST Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 78 SYSTEM CERTIFICATION CHECKLIST376 TO: THE HVCS MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE SECRETARYAUSTRALIAN

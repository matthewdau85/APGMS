IAC CODE SET VOLUME 1 - INTRODUCTION AND MEMBER OBLIGATIONS ANNEXURE A ANNUAL SECURITY AUDITS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 42 (c) Any clear-text PIN block format combined with a PIN encryption process has the characteristics that, for different accounts, encryption of the same PIN value under a given encryption key does not predictably produce the same encrypted results. (Note the format 0, format 3 and format 4 PIN blocks specified in ISO 9564.1 meet this requirement.)118 Reference ISO 9564.1, clauses 9.3 and 9.4; PCI PIN SR 3-1. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (d) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure all PINs are encrypted using DEA 3 or AES when transmitted outside a Secure Cryptographic Device, except where Part 3 of IAC Code Set Volume 2 applies. If a transaction is logged, the PIN block must be permanently masked or deleted from the record before it is logged.119 Reference ISO 9564.1 clause 4.2;ISO 9564.2. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (e) No procedure requires or permits the Cardholder to disclose the PIN verbally or in writing.120 Reference ISO 9564.1 clause 6.1.3; PCI PIN SR 2-1. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (f) Message Authentication applies to all IAC Interchange Links. The MAC must be calculated using, as a minimum, a DEA 3 (128-bit) key, Triple- DES and an algorithm conforming to AS 2805.4.1.

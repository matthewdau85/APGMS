IAC Security Audit – Frequently Asked Questions Version 2.1 (Effective 1 March 2025) This FAQ provides answers to questions regarding Compliance to the AusPayNet IAC Code Set and IAC Annual Security Audits. Terminology used in the FAQ are aligned with PCI PIN, PTS POI and PTS HSM, however clear differentiations should be understood in both the process and requirements. A. General FAQ A.1. Who can signoff an Annual Security Audit as an “auditor”? The IAC Regulations or IAC Code Set does not define the term "auditor" used in Volume 1 of the IAC Code Set. AusPayNet considers the use of the term "auditor" in the context of the Annual Security Audits to be a person, internal or external, authorised by the Participant to carry out an independent review of the Annual Security Audit checklists. This person must have suitable knowledge and expertise in IT security and auditing procedures. There are no requirements that this person, authorised by the Participant, be a registered auditor or part of an internal compliance, risk or auditing division. It is up to the Acquirer or Issuer to decide who is appropriately qualified to sign the Auditor Signoff. A.2. Can an auditor be involved in the collection of evidence and coordination of technical teams? No, the auditor sign-off must be independent of the preparation of the annual security audit. A.3. Who can sign on an Annual Security Audit as a “business signoff”? Business signoff of the annual security audit would normally be expected to be by a senior business manager responsible for the component of the business under audit. A.4. What is the process that an auditor role participant should follow? The following Six steps are a suggested audit process an auditor many utilise: 1. Obtain the completed relevant checklist from the IA Participant. 2. Select a representative sample of questions from the checklist, which should include questions that indicate both: a. non-compliance, and b. compliance with the IAC Code Set. 3. Perform a walk-through of each of the selected questions with the relevant staff, focusing on how they have assured themselves that the responses to the checklist are complete and accurate. 4. Where non-compliance is noted on a checklist, ensure that the IAC Participant have an adequate and timely action plan in place, including: a. remedial actions which will ensure future compliance to the Code Set; b. realistic and proper resolution time frames; and c. there exists a distributed responsibility of tasks. 5. Raise all concerns with the IA Participant and achieve satisfactory resolution/agreement. 6. The auditor should continually be asking the relevant staff as to: a. how they ensure compliance with the IAC Code Set; and b. to provide evidence which demonstrates that their compliance control/monitoring procedures are operating effectively. A.5. What is the audit obligation of IAC participants? All IA Participants must complete an Annual Security Audit (as set out in the IAC Code Set Volume 1 Annexure A, once every calendar year. IA Participants must give AusPayNet prior written notice of the date by which they will complete their Annual Security Audit. The IAC Participant and external auditor must sign the audit once completed. Failure to comply with IAC Code Set Volume 1 clause 3.2 requirement to submit an Annual Security Audit once every calendar year, six months after the end of that calendar year (by 30 June) is a breach of a Threshold Requirement. Under the Regulations for the Issuers and Acquirers Community (IAC), the Issuers and Acquirers Forum (IAF) may designate specific requirements of the IAC Code Set as Threshold Requirements for compliance by IA Participants. The IAF has power under the IAC Regulations to impose fines on IA Participants for non-compliance with the Threshold Requirements, and to refer non-compliance to a Sanctions Tribunal. A.6. What Third Party Providers are in scope for the audit obligations of IAC participants? The IAC Code Set, Volume 1, Section 3.2.2 describes a third-party provider as an organisation that supplies services to a Participant which may or may not be directly connected to Interchange, that provides payment-related services, directly or indirectly, to an IAC participant and/or stores, processes or transmits payment-related data. This payment data includes: • Cardholder Data • PIN Data • Key material A.7. If an IAC Participant has an existing AusPayNet exemption request, is the participant required to resubmit the exemption for the next audit? Resubmission of exemption requests undergoing correction within the granted period is not required. The member must provide an update on the existing exemptions and exemption that is about to expire. Members must also supply an update on the progress of remediation, in accordance with project plans submitted to AusPayNet. A.8. What are the key rotation intervals for Key Encryption Keys (KEK) and Session keys used in Interchange Links? IAC Code Set Volume 4, Section 4.5.2 (b): “Key Encrypting Keys must be changed at the request of the Interchange partner, or, as a minimum, once every two years” and “Session Keys must be changed, as a minimum, once every 2048 Transactions or once an hour, whichever occurs first” A.9. What is the difference between Interchange Links and Interchange Lines? “Interchange Line” means the physical (including wireless) communications infrastructure that provides the medium over which Interchange Activity is supported. An Interchange Line contains, at a minimum, one Interchange Link. “Interchange Link” means the logical link between an Acquirer and an Issuer which facilitates Interchange Activity between them.

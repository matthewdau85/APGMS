requirements in any PCI SSC standards, nor does it endorse the use of any specific technologies, products, or services. While all references made in this document are to PCI DSS version 3.2.1, the general principles and practices offered here may be applied beyond the context of PCI DSS. 1.1 Intended Audience This guidance is intended for organizations seeking to better understand how to maintain compliance with PCI DSS. Examples include merchants, service providers, acquirers (merchant banks), and issuers. This guidance assumes readers are familiar with the PCI DSS requirements, testing procedures, and scoping guidance, and possess a basic understanding of computer information systems, networking technologies, and general IT principles and terminology. 1.2 Terminology Please refer to the PCI DSS Glossary, Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms3 for terms and definitions that are used throughout this document. 1 Ciske van Oosten, Sky Hackett, and Anne Turner, Verizon 2017 Payment Security Report (Verizon, 2017). http://www.verizonenterprise.com/verizon-insights-lab/payment-security/2017/ 2 Ibid. 3 https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/glossary Information Supplement • Best Practices for Maintaining PCI DSS Compliance • January 2019 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 5 1.3 Summary of Recommendations Reliance on the annual assessment may increase the risk of non-compliance between assessments and the risk of subsequent compromise. Establishing an approach and ongoing review processes of all security controls serves to support the organization’s continual compliance and reduces the risk of cardholder data compromise. The following eight key principles are provided in this Information Supplement to help implement and maintain compliance with PCI DSS: 1. Develop and Maintain a Sustainable Compliance Program – For a compliance program to be sustainable, it should be implemented into business-as-usual activities as part of the organization’s overall security strategy. This enables the organization to monitor the effectiveness of its security controls on an ongoing basis and maintain compliance between assessments. The ongoing security of cardholder data should be the driving objective behind all PCI DSS compliance activities—not simply attaining a compliant report. (See 3.1, “Develop and Maintain a Sustainable Security Program.”) 2. Develop Program, Policy, and Procedures – A PCI DSS compliance program that includes people, process, and technology along with supporting policies and procedures should be implemented to help drive proper behavior and to maintain repeatable business and operational processes. (See 3.2, “Program, Policy, and Procedures” for further information.) 3. Define Performance Metrics to Measure Success − An effective metrics program can provide useful data for directing the allocation of resources to minimize risk occurrence and measure the business consequences of security events. The organization should carefully define the scope of its information-security measurement based on specific needs, goals and objectives, operating environments, risk priorities, and compliance program maturity. (See 3.3, “Develop Performance Metrics to Measure Success,” for further information.) 4. Assign Ownership for Coordinating Security Activities – A specific management-level individual should be assigned responsibility for continuous compliance. Activities might include, but are not limited to, centralized coordination of resources, monitoring, projects, and costs associated with PCI DSS compliance. (See 3.4, “Assign Ownership for Coordinating Security Activities,” for further information.) 5. Emphasize Security and Risk Management to Attain and Maintain Compliance – Compliance does not equal security. While PCI DSS provides a solid baseline of security controls, it should not be considered a single source for addressing all security needs. The focus should be on building a culture of security and protecting an organization’s information assets and IT infrastructure, allowing compliance to be achieved as a consequence. (See 3.5, “Emphasize Security and Risk Management to Attain and Maintain Compliance,” for further information.) 6. Continuously Monitor Controls − Organizations should develop strategies that align with their business and security goals to continuously monitor, test, and document the implementation, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and status of controls and activities. (See Information Supplement • Best Practices for Maintaining PCI DSS Compliance • January 2019 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 6 3.6 “Continuously Monitor Security Controls” and Appendix D, “PCI DSS Compliance Program Activities,” for further information.) 7. Detect and Respond to Control Failures – Organizations should have processes for recognizing and responding to security-control failures promptly. Any control failure could constitute a formal security incident and require a more formal incident response. At a minimum, control-failure response processes should include: minimizing the impact of the incident, restoring controls, performing root-cause analysis and remediation, implementing hardening standards, and enhancing monitoring. (See 3.7 “Detect and Respond to Security Control Failures,” for further information.) 8. Maintain Security Awareness – Social engineering techniques are often leading to data breaches and exfiltration of critical data. Organizations should implement a formal security awareness process with content that is kept up to date with the latest trends in breaches. (See 3.8, “Maintain Security Awareness,” for further information.) 9. Monitoring Compliance of Third-Party Service Providers – Often, organizations will rely on third-party service providers to implement and maintain security controls required to meet PCI DSS. Organizations should develop and implement processes to monitor the compliance status of its service providers to determine whether a change in status requires a change in the relationship. (See 3.9, “Monitoring Compliance of Third-Party Service Providers," for further information.) 10. Evolve the Compliance Program to Address Changes – Organizations should evolve their controls with the threat landscape, changes in organizational structure, new business initiatives,

Frameworks AusPayNet is the self-regulatory body for the payments industry. The systems we administer account for 98% of non-cash payment values in Australia. Our rules and guidelines cover cards, cheques, direct debit and direct credit, and high value payments, as well as the distribution of bulk cash, and the COIN infrastructure.

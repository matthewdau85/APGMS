“Digital Operational Resilience Act.” Dual Control Process of using two or more separate entities (usually persons) operating in concert to protect sensitive functions or information. Both entities are equally responsible for the physical protection of materials involved in vulnerable transactions. No single person is permitted to access or use the materials (for example, the cryptographic key). For manual key generation, conveyance, loading, storage, and retrieval, dual control requires dividing knowledge of the key among the entities. See Split Knowledge. e E-commerce (web) Redirection Server A server that redirects a customer browser from a merchant’s website to a different location for payment processing during an ecommerce transaction. ECC Acronym for “Elliptic Curve Cryptography.” See Strong Cryptography . Encryption The (reversible) transformation of data by a cryptographic algorithm to produce cipher text, i.e., to hide the information content of the data. See Strong Cryptography . Encryption Algorithm See Cryptographic Algorithm . Entity In the context of a PCI DSS assessment, a term used to represent the corporation, organization, or business which is undergoing an assessment. f File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) A change-detection solution that checks for changes, additions, and deletions to critical files, and notifies when such changes are detected. File-Level Encryption Technique or technology (either software or hardware) for encrypting the full contents of specific files. Alternatively, see Disk Encryption and Column-Level Database Encryption . Firewall Hardware and/or software technology that protects network resources from unauthorized access. A firewall permits or denies computer traffic between networks with different security levels based upon a set of rules and other criteria. Forensics Also referred to as “computer forensics.” As it relates to information security, the application of investigative tools and analysis techniques to gather evidence from computer resources to determine the cause of data compromises. Investigations into compromises of payment data are typically conducted by a PCI Forensic Investigator (PFI). FTP Acronym for “File Transfer Protocol.” Network protocol used to transfer data from one computer to another through a public network such as the Internet. FTP is widely viewed as an insecure protocol because passwords and file contents are sent unprotected and in cleartext. FTP can be implemented securely via SSH or other technology. i IDS Acronym for “intrusion-detection system.” Index Token A random value from a table of random values that corresponds to a given PAN. Interactive Login The process of an individual providing authentication credentials to directly log into an application or system account. Using interactive login means there is no accountability or traceability of actions taken by that individual. IPS Acronym for “intrusion prevention system.” ISA Acronym for “Internal Security Assessor.” ISO Acronym for “International Organization for Standardization.” Issuer Also referred to as “issuing bank” or “issuing financial institution.” Entity that issues payment cards or performs, facilitates, or supports issuing services, including but not limited to issuing banks and issuing processors. Issuing Services Examples of issuing services include but are not limited to authorization and card personalization. k Key Custodian A role where a person(s) is entrusted with, and responsible for, performing key management duties involving secret and/or private keys, key shares, or key components on behalf of an entity. Key Management System A combination of hardware and software that provides an integrated approach for generating, distributing, and/or managing cryptographic keys for devices and applications. Keyed Cryptographic Hash A hashing function that incorporates a randomly generated secret key to provide brute force attack resistance and secret authentication integrity. Appropriate keyed cryptographic hashing algorithms include but are not limited to: HMAC, CMAC, and GMAC, with an effective cryptographic strength of at least 128-bits ( NIST SP 800-131Ar2 ) . Refer to the following for more information about HMAC, CMAC, and GMAC, respectively: NIST SP 800-107r1, NIST SP 800-38B, and NIST SP 800-38D). See NIST SP 800-107 (Revision 1): Recommendation for Applications Using Approved Hash Algorithms §5.3. KMO Acronym for “Key Management Operations.” l LAN Acronym for “local area network.” LDAP Acronym for “Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.” Least Privileges The minimum level of privileges necessary to perform the roles and responsibilities of the job function. Legal Exception A legal restriction due to a local or regional law, regulation, or regulatory requirement, where meeting a PCI DSS requirement would violate that law, regulation, or regulatory requirement. Contractual obligations or legal advice are not legal restrictions. See the following PCI DSS v4.x documents for information on reporting legal exceptions: The Report on Compliance (ROC) Template and related Attestations of Compliance . The Self-Assessment Questionnaires (SAQs) and related Attestations of Compliance . Note: Where an entity operates in multiple locations, a legal exception may only be claimed for the locations governed by the law, regulation, or regulatory requirement, and may not be claimed for locations in which such law, regulation, or regulatory requirement is inapplicable. Log Logical Access Control Mechanisms that limit the availability of information or information-processing resources only to authorized persons or applications. See Physical Access Control . m MAC In cryptography, an acronym for “message authentication code.” See Strong Cryptography . Magnetic-Stripe Data Masking Method of concealing a segment of PAN when displayed or printed. Masking is used when there is no business need to view the entire PAN. Masking relates to protection of PAN when displayed on screens, paper receipts, printouts, etc. See Truncation for protection of PAN when electronically stored, processed, or transmitted. Media Physical material, including but not limited to, electronic storage devices, removable electronic media, and paper reports. Merchant For

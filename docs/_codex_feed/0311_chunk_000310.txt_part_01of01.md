The detail on how the PCS value is calculated and measured is described in Appendix B. DCR Compared to PCS A more refined method of measuring the level of lightness and darkness of print is “Dynamic Contrast Ratio” or DCR. Both DCR and PCS are a measure of contrast and the mathematical formula is the same. They differ in definition of the terms and the way that each is applied. In DCR, “background” is the average of all pixels in a 0.125 inch square area. As in all computerised scanning, no discrimination of background and foreground is made and this is an overall average, which includes the centre pixel. In PCS a human selection of the background and foreground is made, and a manual sampling is taken to establish average reflectance values for both. This limits the value of PCS when evaluating complex patterns, as arbitrary sampling may give different results from different operators. A computer software image-processing algorithm applies DCR. Each pixel is compared to the local area (0.125 inch square = 1444 pixels) automatically, and all the black/white decisions result in a binary image. Application of DCR is not only a contrast decision, but also a consideration of the rate of change of reflectance over distance. As no human decision is required the same result is always achieved in analysis based on DCR, within the limits of the equipment used. The output of the measurement is expressed in “paxels” and the maximum value for any Area Of Interest (AOI) is 8 paxels. Appendix B Measurement of Print Contrast Signal and Dynamic Contrast Ratio Measurement of Print Contrast Signal The Print Contrast Signal (PCS) is a measure based on the reflectance of a specified area in relation to the background reflectance. In the case of a printed cheque, the PCS of a printed ink is the ratio of the reflectance of the printed area to the un-printed cheque paper. The Print Contrast Signal of a point is defined by the following formula: PCSB = (RB - RP) / RB Where RB is the average reflectance of the background within the area of interest and RP is the reflectance of a small measurement area centred on point P. The reflectance, and consequently the PCS, is measured with an aperture 0.008 inch in diameter. This measurement is performed using the black-backing method as described below. Reflectance as measured by a reflectance meter or print contrast meter is an absolute value calibrated by reference to a freshly pressed magnesium oxide (MgO) powder, or barium sulphate powder (BaSO4) as the 100% value. All reflectance measurements shall be made on equipment having a spectral response as specified below, and using an aperture 0.008 inch in diameter. Reflectance as used in the standard refers to diffuse reflection; that is the reflected light used for measurement excludes spectrally reflected light. Measurement should be accomplished by using the black-backing method; that is the sample being measured should be backed with a black material having no more than 0.5% reflectance. Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 54 AusPayNet September 2017 The PCS can be measured directly with specialised instruments, such as the Macbeth (Model No. PCM II), RDM Image Qualifier (Model No. IQ 1000 or No. IQ 97) or Clearwave Electronics (Model No. 082A or No. 082B). It can also be measured with normal reflectance meters as long as they are fitted with a filter that has a spectral response peak at 555 nanometres and a half peak response at 510 to 610 nanometres (eg. Kodak Wratten No. 106). Measurement of Dynamic Contrast Ratio For areas where the concern is the legibility of hand-print or computer- print over the background design, Dynamic Contrast Ratio methods have been found to be the best method of predicting results. For declared “Areas Of Interest”, this method is preferred to PCS. The starting point of generating a Dynamic Contrast Image is a 300 dpi greyscale image, where each pixel can have up to 256 levels of grey. Each pixel is measured through an aperture of 0.008”. This is converted to a binary image where each pixel can only have two levels, black or white, and a decision has to be made on each pixel. In this method a Dynamic Thresholding process is used to convert the greyscale image to a bitmap using special software that applies a Dynamic Contrast Ratio algorithm to the image. This is applied over an area of 0.125” square and uses as its reference point the centre pixel (refer Figure B-1). It has been determined that the appropriate ratio is 0.2 and the following formula is applied where R is the % reflectance. DCR = (R area average – R centre pixel) R area average If the DCR is less than or equal to 0.2, the pixel is made white. If the DCR is more than 0.2, the pixel is black. Within a limited range this is a linear relationship, but the following cut off points are used with reference to the centre pixel:  If the centre pixel’s reflectance is less than 20%, it is always black.  If the centre pixel’s reflectance is more than 70%, it is always white. To determine the effect the background has on the legibility of the data to be retained, this bitmap information is used to measure the potential for interference, which is termed

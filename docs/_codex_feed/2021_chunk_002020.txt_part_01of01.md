(such as filtering, pagination etc.). For example, latitude and longitude in decimal format - as this is how developers will work with latitude and longitude; or using simple types (e.g. a single date-time field) instead of a complex type (e.g. a choice field with a nesting of date and time). • Consideration of ISO 20022 and JSON: An Implementation Best Practices. Includes pertinent modelling guides NPP API Framework – Publication Version 5.0 Page 11 Security Standards Each NPP Participant is responsible for setting the security standards for Third Party Service Providers connecting to that NPP Participant via APIs. NPPA recommends the use of global best practice in security standards where possible. NPP Overlay Service Identification In order to support in each common API request call, a mechanism to vary the API call attributes according to Overlay Service, the Service Level element (from <SvcLvl/Prtry> element in ISO 20022> is defined as the first element in the API request. The Service Level element is used to distinguish the specific messaging or overlay service under which an API (or XML message) is being used e.g.: npp.msg.01-x2p1.03 (example of an overlay service for basic messaging). It is optional to send Service Level information. Status Codes Each API may need to consider three status codes that serve different purposes: • The HTTP Status Code reflects the outcome of the API call (the HTTP operation on the resource). E.g. 200 - OK , 400 - Bad Request, 405 - Method Not Allowed • In the API content, where a status could be returned to reflect the outcome of the request. For example, the Status field in a Payment API payload could reflect the status of a specific payment that makes use of the ISO 20022 PaymentStatusCode code-list enumeration (external code list) to report status. E.g. CH11 - Creditor Identifier Incorrect • Participant specific status codes. Each NPP Participant may have a specific set of status codes that it has defined for API connectivity to its own infrastructure. Notification and Callback Events The API Framework requires a number of events to be notified to the API user. The Framework notifies the user of an event and requires the user to call back to the NPP Participant so that credentials can be validated before details are shared. This allows the NPP Participant to protect the data security and integrity of the resource. Events are created for the API User as a notification of activity related to a Payment or Batch Processing. Payment Event Notification (camt.a12) API allows an NPP Participant to notify the API user that a payment event has occurred in their account. The customer can then use the notification ID returned in Payment Event Notification and use Payment Event Details or Batch Event Details to fetch details about the payment or batch. NPP API Framework – Publication Version 5.0 Page 12 3 NPP Open API Use Cases Payment Initiation The Usage example (Figure 1) and payment flow (Figure 2 below) illustrates an NPP payment initiation process that could be realised as an NPP real-time Credit Transfer through the use of a series of common open APIs made available by NPP Participants and associated institutions. APIs are foreseen as complementary to other channels such as asynchronous messaging or web forms / mobile phone apps. Usage Example Figure 1 below illustrates the example of a corporate paying their supplier and the associated interactions and the work flow that might take place: Figure 1. Corporate making a payment to their supplier NPP API Framework – Publication Version 5.0 Page 13 Figure 2. Corporate making a Tax payment to the ATO Figure 3. Corporate making salary payments to employees NPP API Framework – Publication Version 5.0 Page 14 Payment Flow Processing Steps The sequence of processing steps in this section is provided as an illustrative example of a possible payment flow using APIs; it is a guide only and is not meant to be prescriptive. Note: In addition to basic payments, the payment reflected below may also represent a Salary, Tax or Superannuation payment. In this case, the relevant classification of this payment should be used, e.g. SALA, TAXS or PENS. Figure 4. Corporate making a payment to their supplier Step Description 1-2 Payer business initiates a check for a valid PayID via their NPP Participant before submitting a payment initiation 3 Payer business submits a payment initiation request to their NPP Participant 4 Payer’s NPP Participant creates a clearing request with details from the payment initiation request and PayID which is routed via the NPP Basic Infrastructure to the Payee’s NPP Participant 5 Payee’s NPP Participant accepts clearing request and responds with a clearing notification 6-7 NPP Basic Infrastructure and FSS complete settlement processing and sends confirmations to both NPP Participants 8 Payer’s NPP Participant responds to Payment Status (successful / unsuccessful) to Payer 9 Payer’s NPP Participant notifies Payer Business of a payment event in their account. Payee’s NPP Participant notifies Payee Business of a payment event in their account. NPP API Framework – Publication Version 5.0 Page 15 Step Description 10 Payer Business gets details of a debit from their account from the Payer’s NPP Participant. Payee Business gets details of a credit to their account from the Payee’s NPP Participant.

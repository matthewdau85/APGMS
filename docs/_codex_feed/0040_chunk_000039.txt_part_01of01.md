Welcome to the second edition of The Quantum Leap, our quarterly update on the AES Migration Program. Each quarter, we will bring you a high-level update on the progress of the program and what’s ahead. We will also provide updates on developments in Australia and globally, and will focus on cyber security, cryptography and the impacts of classical and quantum computing. Your suggestions for topics in future publications and feedback on this edition are welcomed. Please feel free to contact us by email at aesmigrationprogramteam@auspaynet.com.au . We hope you enjoy this second edition. Riaz Hussain Head of Security, Standards & AES Transition What we have achieved in the last quarter The current phase of the program is focused on preparation for pilot, currently scheduled for 2026. Key deliverables from this phase include: An update to the Technical Blueprint to include amendments to the relevant Australian Standard, AS2805. A migration handbook, which will provide further guidance to participants on how to navigate the migration process and become a repository of lessons learned as we proceed. Industry Testing Plans and the supporting tools that participants will require. An Information Management System (IMS) to enable the industry to track progress. An uplift in communications and change activities as the industry mobilises. Specifically, the last quarter has seen progress continue with: Public consultation on the proposed revisions to AS2805. Development of updates to the Issuers and Acquirers Community (IAC) Code Set – this articulates the specific program compliance obligations for IAC issuers and acquirers. Consultation on the setting of sunrise and sunset dates for the program – these dates are the key milestones for the program and establish compliance timeframes for program participants. Ongoing development of industry test plans. Ongoing development of the migration handbook. Development of the IMS commencing. Member open days in Sydney and Melbourne (more below). A mid-year review of the program to ensure it remains on track for success. Sydney and Melbourne open days We recently held two Member open days in Sydney and Melbourne, providing an opportunity for program participants to come together and hear the latest from the Government, industry and AusPayNet. Highlights of the two events included presentations on: The cyber threat landscape. International and domestic actions to address the threat. Combatting the threat with cyber security partnerships. Australian public and private sector responses. Cryptographic requirements and controls for security of payments. The latest on the program. We look forward to hosting more program events for collaboration, information sharing and networking. Our next will be a webinar on the Technical Blueprint to be held in November. Our Migration Strategy The Migration Strategy was a key deliverable from Phase 1 of the program in 2024. It outlines our proposed approach to the migration, the principles which we will apply and how to manage the transition and co-existence. Three principles guide the strategy: Collaboration and openness: It is expected that participants will collaborate within a social code of conduct involving: Transparency in relation to dealing with the program and other participants, particularly regarding their progress and timelines. Openness in sharing information relevant to the program that could assist other participants with their progress and in meeting their timelines. A spirit of collaboration for the greater good of the public and the industry. Retaining flexibility for participants’ internal programs: To provide each participant maximum flexibility in running their respective programs, the migration approach should aim to minimise interdependencies between individual participants. However, this is subject to their meeting industry milestones, such as Sunrise and Sunset dates. Risk-based sequencing of the program: The migration approach emphasises prioritising the upgrade of the most critical infrastructure within the card payments network. It also makes sense to attend at the outset to the system components requiring the least upgrade effort, reducing the interim risks within the lifetime of the program. Taking this approach enables participants to largely implement the migration on their own schedules within the overall program timeline. Coordination is limited to those areas where this is truly necessary, such as interchange links. This also means that there will be an extended period of coexistence when both the Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES) and AES will be in operation at the same time, with each step of a transaction using the highest security standard available for that step. Over time, as AES is rolled out, we will see TDES retired and end-to end transactions using AES. The next key phase in the migration is the initial stage of Vanguard Industry Testing (VIT) and Pilot. During VIT, participants will conduct a subset of industry testing to enable them to conduct a live Pilot. It is expected that the live Pilot will be a controlled exercise involving a limited use of AES in a production environment. The VIT and Pilot steps are critical in testing and de-risking the subsequent execution program. What are we seeing around the world? There have been some recent notable developments around the world relevant to AES. Firstly, the European Union has begun a coordinated effort for Member States to switch critical infrastructure to quantum-resistant encryption by 2030. This initiative calls for the AES transition to begin by late 2026 and be fully completed by 2035 and aims to safeguard EU data and communications from the threat posed by future, powerful quantum computers. Secondly, the PCI Security Standards Council released its Cryptography Guidance Paper , which outlines the minimum requirement for 128-bit encryption

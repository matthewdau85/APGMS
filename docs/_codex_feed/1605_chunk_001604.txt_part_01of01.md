to access their respective environment. Product IDs must be kept confidential and secure to ensure they are used only for their intended purpose. De-Whitelisting Process De-whitelisting is the process of suspending or revoking access to ATO production or test environments. A product may be de-whitelisted where: it is not compliant with our requirements the service generates a significant number of unexpected technical errors resulting in data issues, or a cyber incident presents a risk to our digital wholesale channel, ATO reputation or taxpayers. End-User Agreement End users of your product/s must accept our End-User Agreement. This agreement sets out the rights and restrictions in using ATO digital wholesale services. SBR and API Portal each have their own agreements: ATO Service Support Versioning Strategy Over time SBR services will change or be replaced to accommodate legislative, policy and technology changes. We will endeavour to work with you to minimise the impact these changes may have on your products. For further details, you should refer to this versioning strategy . Security This section provides information on how to interact with our digital wholesale services securely and responsibly. Fraud Mitigation Our digital services present a range of service opportunities but also pose some risks and security implications. It is crucial that we work in partnership with you to protect the integrity of the tax, super and registry systems for the Australian community. DSPs who produce tax practitioner lodgement software must also consider customer verification guidelines as determined by the ATO and the Tax Practitioners Board . The ATO DSP Operational Security Framework and industry specific guidelines (such as Essential 8 ) support the protection of ATO systems and client data against cyber threats. You must provide detail on how your product meets the requirements of the DSP Operational Security Framework. DSP Operational Security Framework (OSF) The DSP Operational Security Framework (OSF) sets out a minimum level of security requirements that you must meet to access ATO digital wholesale services. The OSF uses a risk scaled model to determine the security controls required for your product or service. The following pages provide more information on the risk scaled model, and security control requirements: Maintaining Compliance There are ongoing expectations that you maintain your compliance with the DSP OSF. Requirements for maintaining your compliance include, but are not limited to, that you must: notify us as soon as practicable of significant changes to your business or product environment hold a current certification (both independent and self-assessed) and take appropriate steps to update and supply us with a current copy of your certification, and undertake annual reviews to ensure you remain compliant with the DSP OSF. Failure to maintain your compliance can result in de-whitelisting. You can find out more about maintaining compliance and what happens if you don’t on the maintaining compliance page. Data Breaches Where a data breach is identified you must contact us immediately to ensure appropriate action can be taken. A data breach occurs when personally identifiable information (PII) an entity holds is subject to unauthorised access or disclosure to an unknown party. You should refer to the data breaches page for information on reporting data breaches, and our actions. Security Monitoring The security monitoring requirement seeks to minimise the impact of cyber incidents by having controls in place to detect, prevent and respond to cyber-attacks. Monitoring is considered a joint responsibility between you and the ATO. The ATO conducts monitoring at the network, application, and transaction layers. If anomalies or areas of concern are identified, we may re-assess your whitelisting suitability. We will contact you or your representative before making changes to your whitelisted status unless exceptional circumstances apply. Privacy You have a responsibility for supporting clients to maintain the privacy of personal information, including tax file numbers (TFNs). Under the TFN rule under section 17 of the Privacy Act 1988, sharing an individual’s TFN with a third party is generally not permitted. Office of the Australian Information Commissioner provides guidance on the rule that may assist you. Authentication and Authorisation All ATO digital wholesale services (including SBR and ATO API Portal) use the myID Machine Credential to authenticate transactions with the ATO. The myID Machine Credential (known hereafter as M2M credential), positively identifies an organisation (with an ABN) that has initiated the transaction to the ATO. Limitations on the use of the M2M credential, responsibilities and associated conditions can be found in the myID Terms of Use - Machine . AUSkey Software Developer Kit (ADK) – Developer and End-User Licences ATO digital wholesale services that use the SBR channel, can use the AUSkey Software Developer Kit (or ‘ADK’) to manage the keystore and generate security tokens using the M2M credential . The ADK includes licences that outline restrictions to the distribution, sub-licencing, modification, or derivation of the source code of the SDK or the Software. Cloud Software Authentication and Authorisation (CAA) Software products that do not utilise your client’s M2M credential (such as Software as a Service) must implement the Cloud Authentication and Authorisation (CAA) solution . In addition to a Product ID which identifies your product to the ATO, each subscription or instance of your software also needs an ID to validate the authorisation between the reporting party, the DSP and the ATO. A Software Subscription ID (SSID), commonly referred to as a Software ID, is a unique ID that is used to identify each unique subscription or instance of software.

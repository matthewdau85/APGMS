Auxiliary Domestic field, if present, or the BSB field. A closing Domestic symbol forms part of this field. This is an optional field and is commonly used on Deposit forms to identify specific depositors to the account, e.g. a branch store of a chain of retail outlets. It is often referred to as an Agent Number. When printed as one operation a character space is not necessary between the closing symbol of the Auxiliary Domestic field and the rightmost character of the Extra Auxiliary Domestic field. Note: The length of the form must be sufficient to ensure that the right-hand edge of the closing (left-most) symbol is not closer than 3/8 inch from the left or trailing edge of the form. The right-most digit of the field must be printed in a position not less than 46 and not greater than 48. A closing Domestic symbol must be printed in the left-most position of the field, but not in a position greater than 59. When the Auxiliary Domestic field and the Extra Auxiliary Domestic field are printed in one operation a space is not required between the fields. When the Auxiliary Domestic field and the Extra Auxiliary Domestic field are printed in different operations, a minimum of one space is to be provided between each field. If the Extra Auxiliary Domestic field is used for an agent number, consult the relevant Financial Institution for the structure as usage varies between Institutions. Figure 20 MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 28 AusPayNet September 2017 4 MICR Printing Technologies 4. MICR Printing Technologies A general description of the various technologies that are in use for printing MICR is provided in this section as guidance for those printing, or who may be considering printing MICR documents. An understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the various technologies available is important in equipment selection and establishing quality control procedures. The potential causes of generating out of specification MICR printing are outlined to assist in the production of good quality documents. In all cases, it is essential to monitor the quality of printing with the appropriate equipment to ensure the process is correctly adjusted. Some processes, particularly conventional printing methods, require much greater attention than others. The level of care can only be assessed from experience and knowledge of the particular technology or machine used. 4.1 Conventional Printing Processes 4.1.1 Letterpress Letterpress printing uses raised type that is covered with ink, which is then transferred directly to paper under pressure. This method was the original manner in which MICR was printed and the specifications for character shape, dimensions and print quality still largely reflect the characteristics of letterpress printing. Lead type is not now common but if used it is important that the correct E-13B font is used and that the type be in good condition. Numbering boxes, likewise, must be correctly designed and free of damage or excessive wear. Lead type can only print static data whereas numbering boxes can print a combination of static and incremental data, plus mechanically generated check digit numbers. Because of the nature of the process, the raised printing surface is particularly susceptible to debossment and ink spread. It is important to set type and numbering boxes evenly or part of the printing may be debossed and show excessive growth whilst another part may be poorly inked, giving a thin or broken up appearance. Special care is required with the maintenance of numbering boxes and the manufacturer's recommendation for cleaning and oiling should be followed in detail. Over lubrication is to be avoided particularly on high-speed rotary presses as the oil may contaminate the face of the E-13B character with resultant loss of affinity for magnetic ink. The pre-inking of all characters on each sequential numbering wheel is necessary to ensure adequate ink coverage. The best results are obtained by maintaining an ink film of even density over the entire typeface, that is free of voids, and with the least possible squeeze-out. Over inking results in excessive growth, filling in of characters, ragged edges and set-off on the back of following sheets. Conversely, under inking will result in under-size characters with voids and low signal strength. Impression and ink film thickness must be matched so that neither factor has to compensate for the faults of the other. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 29 AusPayNet September 2017 4.1.1 Offset Lithography The lithographic process can only be used for the printing of static MICR encoding. The original image is normally typeset, converted to a photographic image and then transferred to a printing plate. Modern processes are eliminating many of these steps, but the requirements for maintaining quality remain unchanged. Photo-composing/typesetting devices must use the correct E-13B font and horizontal spacing between characters. If negatives are used, only reliable, stable based film and a properly compounded developer should be used. Because the ink will be magnetic, no guide marks are allowed within the clear band in which the MICR characters will appear. A final inspection of opaquing should be completed using a magnifier over the same clear band area to ensure that pinholes do not go undetected. There are no special requirements for the preparation of plates, other than normal maintenance of good quality control of the process. For direct imaging processes, whether using paper, plastic or metal plates, the same requirements for care apply,

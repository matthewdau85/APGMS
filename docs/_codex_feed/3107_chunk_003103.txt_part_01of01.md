CASE STUDY PCI Professional (PCIP) Training Real Experience. Real Benefits. No one tells our story better than our training participants themselves. Here’s what Chris had to say... Why was getting training through the Council important to you? Much of my work at Bit9 revolves around dealing with PCI compliance issues, as well as validating that security controls and policies used to prove compliance are complete, effective, and best of breed for my clients. In order to enhance the offerings for my clients, I had a strong desire to demonstrate a specialization in the PCI DSS. PCIP training was a perfect vehicle to show my commitment and because the PCIP qualification training course is developed and delivered by the creators of the standard, I was assured of getting the highest value of content and expertise within the PCI industry. What knowledge gained in the course, are you using in your job today? I often become entrenched in our customer’s PCI assessment process as Bit9’s platform fits into the mix when validating many PCI requirements. Knowledge of recent compensating control methods and current use cases – which I learned in the class – has helped me introduce new solutions to facilitate PCI compliance. I’m also using and sharing my knowledge of PCI compliance policy and security controls with our own internal policy and engineering teams, which has had a positive effect on our own internal policies as well as our product offering for PCI. THE COMPANY Bit9, Inc. 266 Second Ave Waltham, MA 02451 The Bit9 Security Platform stops advanced persistent threats on servers, virtual systems, desktops, laptops, point-of sale and SCADA* systems. Using visibility, detection, protection and incident response capabilities, Bit9 provides a new generation endpoint and server security solution to reduce operational costs, enforce policy, improve security and enable compliance, and measure regulatory risk. THE PRACTITIONER Christopher Strand • Security Compliance Practice Director • 2 years with Bit9 Chris, a 20 year IT veteran, specializes in helping his clients address and close the gaps within their compliance requirements. The one common theme that has existed throughout Chris’ career is creating solutions that provide a clear path to policy enforcement and compliance, containing all the tools and services needed to get there. THE OUTCOME My PCIP qualification positions me as a subject matter expert where I use my understanding of compensating controls, segmentation, and PCI scoping, to provide my clients with innovative solutions that facilitate their PCI compliance. The investment in my PCIP training strengthens Bit9’s proactive PCI stance and builds our credibility as a thought leader in the area of compliance validation. Can you provide a specific example? I am working on a project with a large retail group to develop a security awareness and policy enforcement solution. This project requires an up to date and solid awareness of the PCI standard as well as knowledge of how the PCI DSS has been evolving. The PCIP training and coverage of all the PCI DSS supplements was beneficial and indispensable in assisting with the smooth deployment of policy and will benefit the completion of this project and the customer. How has your company benefited from this training? Over the past year, Bit9 has stepped up our PCI policies and we have a much more robust approach to PCI policy enforcement. We take our PCI policies seriously, and the knowledge I gained through PCIP training has had a positive effect. Actually, my PCIP training was triggered by our desire to build an industry leading compliance validation solution. My PCIP qualification helps to differentiate our business by enabling us to design improved specialized compliance solutions, create relevant compelling messaging, and accelerates our sales process. It helps to demonstrate to our customers that we are serious about the programs that we deliver, and that we don’t hesitate to make the investment in specialized personnel to support those programs. Having a compliance specialist that is a qualified PCIP on staff, is the outcome of that commitment. Would you recommend PCIP training to others? Yes! The PCIP qualification does a good job at ensuring that the participant recognizes and understands the security implications of the requirements. Much time is spent on explaining the underlying implications and spirit of each requirement which some other compliance regulatory certifications tend to miss. I would highly recommend the PCIP course to anyone who works within the payments industry.

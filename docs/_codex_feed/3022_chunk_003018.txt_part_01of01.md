content may include analytics, testing packages, content optimization, fraud detection, or any other service. In some cases, service providers providing logos (e.g. “security seals”) deliver these as scripts. Scripts included in a merchant website in this fashion run with the same permission as the merchant’s website, so in this way the merchant is not protected by the SOP. The net result of this is that these scripts can modify any element on the page, including monitoring all keyboard input and copying the contents of the page or payment forms to other servers. Effectively, any script running on a website has complete control over that website. If payment websites include content from third parties, a compromise of the third party will result in an attacker gaining control over the payment website.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 33 Although this is a relatively obvious attack vector, similar problems can be caused by elements other than scripts. Attacks have at various points in history been executed from images, style sheets (CSS), and other HTML elements using browser content-type sniffing. Merchants developing e-commerce solutions should assume that any third-party element might be unsafe. Merchants and service providers can use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the inclusion or behavior of some third-party elements, but this is not a fail-safe.

Per the PCI SSC Migrating from SSL and Early TLS: “SSL/TLS encrypts a channel between two endpoints (for example, between a web browser and web server) to provide privacy and reliability of data transmitted over the communications channel.” Because of the deprecation of SSL and early TLS, both protocols no longer “…meet the security needs of entities implementing strong cryptography to protect payment data over public or untrusted communications channels.” SSL/TLS is also used to describe digital certificates that provide a level of authentication between the browser and the web server. These certificates are used to deliver both encryption and authentication. In other words, having a certificate on a website provides for the encryption of data being transmitted from the browser to the web server (so the data cannot be intercepted over the Internet by an eavesdropper), and the certificate authenticates the web server (so the sender knows that the CHD or other data the browser is sending to the web server is actually going to the right web server, and not a phisher or a cyber-thief). This is true for both SSL and TLS certificates, which are often referred to as “certs,” “SSL certs,” and “TLS certs.” Nevertheless, when talking about the security protocol that is used between the browser and the web server for encryption of data, “SSL” and “TLS” have different meanings. Appendix A2 to PCI DSS 3.2 provides guidelines for replacing TLS 1.0 and any version of the SSL protocol (e.g., SSL 1.0, SSL 2.0, or SSL 3.0) with a secure alternative, such as TLS 1.1 or higher (TLS 1.2 recommended). To check the protocol used on a given website, see the discussion about tools in Section 3.4, “Tools for Monitoring and Managing E- commerce Implementations.” 3.2 Selecting the Certification Authority Certification Authorities (CAs) and their resellers provide SSL/TLS certificates. Some things to consider in selecting a CA (and things which a merchant might want to consider adding to an RFI/RFP) include looking for documentation and/or evidence that: a) Security is core to the CA’s business. b) It has a history of upstanding reputation, reliability/uptime, and trustworthiness. c) It provides 24/7/365 customer support that is readily available—for example, by e-mail, phone, and chat. d) It provides industry-standard authentication practices. e) It separates authentication, support, and sales processes. f) It provides a cloud-based console for certificate management. g) It provides highly reliable Certificate Revocation Listing and Online Certificate Status Protocol services. h) It has a history of WebTrust audit compliance. i) It provides warrantees for services.

Some things for a merchant to consider in specifying its needs (and to consider adding to an RFI/RFP) include: a) Authentication method (Refer to Section 4.1, “Certificate types (DV, OV, EV) and associated risks.”) b) Core SSL/TLS certificate capabilities/features: i. Authentication methods (DV, OV, EV) ii. Support for Subject Alternative Name (SAN), wildcards, Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) iii. Validity period iv. 128/256-bit encryption v. Support for multiple currently-approved (by NIST or PCI) encryption algorithms vi. Support for multiple key lengths based on currently-approved (by NIST or PCI) encryption ciphers vii. Breadth of browser support viii. Re-issuance of certificates c) Optional/added-value capabilities/features of a CA:

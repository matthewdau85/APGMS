The High-Level Discussion Points for Determining Responsibility in Appendix A may help in the completion of a detailed PCI DSS responsibility matrix. Considerations for each PCI DSS requirement include:  Does the TPSP perform/manage/maintain the required control?  How is the control implemented, and what are the supporting processes—e.g., process for patch updates would include details of testing, scheduling, approvals, etc.?  How and when will the TPSP provide ongoing assurance and/or evidence to the entity that controls are met—for example, periodic reports, real-time notifications, results of testing, etc.? Note: This Appendix is intended for optional use at the discretion of the entity and/or TPSP; completion of this Appendix is not a requirement nor is it necessary for an entity or TPSP to complete this Appendix to meet PCI DSS Requirement 12.8.515.

continues the team to grow. So hopefully we can touch on a few of those things. And we'll always do it from this standpoint of looking at from the strategist and the pit wall. But looking at a much more simple example, you know, probably we'll look at a pit stop, and we'll say, how does it work in a pit stop? And if we can do it in that environment, then we can certainly apply it to many, many other industries. Alicia Malone: Well, I am so excited to hear your keynote. I think this is going to be so fascinating. And since you are on Coffee with the Council , we like to ask our guests how they take their coffee. Or, if you're not a coffee drinker, what do you prefer instead? Bernie Collins: This is a very easy one for me because I am not a coffee drinker. Because of my Irish roots, I'm a very heavy tea drinker. So, I drink a lot of tea. And I don't know if the translation comes across, but here we call it Builder’s tea. So, it's just like English breakfast tea with some milk in it, no sugar. Alicia Malone: That sounds great. Well, thank you so much for joining us on Coffee with the Council , Bernie, and we look forward to seeing you at the Community Meeting this fall. Bernie Collins: Yeah, thank you very much again for having me and I look forward to meeting everyone and hopefully I can bring some of the learnings of F1 to you at the Europe Community Meeting in Amsterdam. Alicia Malone: You can catch Bernie on stage as the keynote speaker at PCI SSC's Europe Community Meeting in Amsterdam, Netherlands, October 14th through the 16th.

The standard ensures merchants, financial institutions and others can accept and process payment cards securely with ATMs, unattended kiosks, mobile dongles and point of sale (POS) devices. “As we see increasing attacks on ATMs and at the POS, it’s critical to ensure the highest level of security at the device level,” said PCI SSC Chief Technology Officer Troy Leach. “The latest version of the PCI requirements for point of interaction devices will help businesses provide the strongest protections to their customers.” Changes introduced in PTS POI version 4.1 build on updates made in version 4.0 in 2013 with enhancements to testing procedures to increase the robustness of the security protections for POI devices. Key changes include:  The addition of a new Core Module section that applies to all POI device types that addresses the configuration and maintenance procedures relevant to the security of POI devices;  The addition of testing requirements to reflect that PTS evaluation laboratories will begin validating vendor documentation of vendor policies and procedures for compliance to the Device Management security requirements, which pertain to device management during manufacture and up until the facility of initial key loading or deployment, where other PCI requirements such as PIN Security and P2PE provide coverage. POI device manufacturers can access the updated requirements, including a summary of changes from version 4.0 to version 4.1 on the PCI SSC website at https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/documents.php.

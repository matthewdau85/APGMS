Service standards We welcome respectful and courteous feedback on our performance in achieving the standards outlined in this Client Service Charter Accessibility The Office of Parliamentary Counsel aims to make information on this website accessible to all users. Alternative text or alt-text is a short textual description of an image that is not visible on the face of a document. It is included to assist users of legislation, particularly vision impaired users, who use screen readers to understand the content of images. From 2022, alt-text has been included in all images in primary and delegated legislation drafted by OPC. OPC is working on including alt-text in previously published documents. This website is a dynamic website, and the documents published are the work of a number of different external authors and agencies. Some of these documents may have accessibility issues, or contain material that is inherently difficult to present in an accessible format, such as maps and diagrams. Most legislation is displayed on the title page Text tab in HTML format. Downloads from the website are usually offered in a choice of file formats (pdf, doc and ePub) Large documents that exceed 600 pages in size may be split into multiple volumes to keep download sizes and times manageable.

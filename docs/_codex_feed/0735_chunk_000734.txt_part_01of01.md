not made an explicit choice of debit network • All ’device-not-present’ transaction types, including: o Merchant-initiated (card on file) transactions o Mobile phone transactions (i.e. transactions made in a mobile phone browser or application) o QR code payments, including both customer-presented QR codes and merchant- presented QR codes, where notification should be provided when the customer enters payment information on a website or mobile phone application. o Phone order transactions, where notification should be provided verbally Merchant Choice Routing – Online Notification Guidelines P a g e | 4 Where ‘Reasonable Notification’ is Not Expected: • ‘Device-present’ transactions (e.g. Transactions that occur in-person on a phone via a mobile wallet) • Transactions undertaken using a Single Network Debit Card, a credit card or gift card • Transactions where the customer has made an explicit choice of debit network to process the transaction • Transactions that are not routed away from the “front-of-card network” Guidelines Where notification of MCR is expected, it is recommended that: • Online Notification Text is displayed to the customer, • A statement is added to merchant’s Terms and Conditions, and • An explanation is added to merchant’s “Frequently Asked Questions”. A quick reference guide for recommended notification may be found in Appendix A at the end of this document. Transaction Scenarios The Guidelines should be followed in the following scenarios: • Single Transaction - When a customer undertakes each transaction. • New Recurring Transaction (including ‘card on file’ set-up) - When a customer sets up a new recurring transaction or ‘card on file’ arrangement, the Online Notification Text only needs to be displayed during the setup of this arrangement. The merchant is free to route the initial transaction and all future recurring transactions as advised in that notification. • Existing Recurring Transaction (including existing ‘card on file’ arrangements) - If a customer has an existing recurring transaction or ‘card on file’ arrangement with a merchant where the obligation of ‘Reasonable Notification’ applies, the merchant is to communicate to the customer, via email, letter or another form of communication, that routing may be implemented. This notification should be provided to the customer at least 20 days in advance of the initial implementation of routing on the customer’s transactions. After initial notification, the merchant is free to route all future recurring transactions as advised in that notification. Online Notification Text Where: Notification text should be displayed to the customer in a visible space before completion of the check-out process, at a time when the customer can cancel the transaction or modify their payment method. Merchant Choice Routing – Online Notification Guidelines P a g e | 5 What: Notification text should advise the customer that routing by the merchant or another party in the transaction process could occur. Merchants should use the most accurate and direct notification that they are able to provide. Suggested notification - Single Transaction: This payment will be completed via [Scheme]*. See the ‘Terms and Conditions’ for further details. Suggested notification - Recurring Transaction / ‘Card on file’ setup: Please note your initial payment and all future payments using this card will be completed via [Scheme1]. See the ‘Terms and Conditions’ for further details. [Scheme*] should be replaced with the scheme network through which the transaction will be routed. For example, “This payment will be completed via eftpos.” Where a merchant is unable to confirm the scheme network through which the transaction will be routed before the customer completes the transaction, a generic notification should be displayed. I. Where a merchant is able to identify the networks supported by the customer’s card prior to completion of the transaction, these networks should be specified in the notification. Suggested notification - Single Transaction: This payment will be completed via [SchemeA] or [SchemeB]. See the ‘Terms and Conditions’ for further details. Suggested notification - Recurring Transaction / ‘Card on file’ setup: Please note your initial payment and all future payments using this card will be completed via [Scheme2] or [Scheme3]. See the ‘Terms and Conditions’ for further details. [SchemeA] and [SchemeB] should be replaced with the scheme networks supported by the Dual Network Debit Card. II. Where a merchant is unable to confirm to the customer any specific card details, a generic notification should be displayed. Suggested notification - Single Transaction: Please note if you are using a card displaying two debit networks (a Dual Network Debit Card) your payment may be processed through either network. See the ‘Terms and Conditions’ for further details. Suggested notification - Recurring Transaction / ‘Card on file’ setup: Please note if you are using a card displaying two debit networks (a Dual Network Debit Card) your first payment and all future debit payments using this card may be processed through either network. See the ‘Terms and Conditions’ for further details. Merchant Choice Routing – Online Notification Guidelines P a g e | 6 Terms and Conditions Where: Merchant’s Terms and Conditions (or equivalent) should be updated. What: Terms and Conditions should notify the customer that routing may occur when using Dual Network Debit Cards to complete transactions. Suggested Terms and Conditions clause: Online Payments Processing – Dual Network Debit Cards Online payments are processed through the credit or debit payment network(s) enabled on your card. Where your card displays two debit payment networks [Merchants*] may process the payment through either network. [Merchants*] can be replaced with the merchant’s trading name, or remain as

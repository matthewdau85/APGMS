Consequently, many aspects of an entity’s governance program can be outsourced to minimize scope and exposure. If a company decides to manage its own anti-fraud program with respect to CHD and has CHD in the clear (instead of a replacement token), this may mean that its scope has been expanded to include its corporate structure. Therefore, companies must determine whether and how they will conduct their own anti-fraud programs. Some service providers manage the overall processing, transmitting, and/or storage of cardholder data along with anti-fraud tools and analytics as a value-added service. Anti-Fraud Measures As a CNP channel, e-commerce does not have access to the cardholder’s PIN or signature for verification of the cardholder. Instead, e-commerce payments rely on the merchant capturing the card security code (the three-digit number printed on the card signature panel or four-digit number on the front of an American Express card). A cardholder verification method to confirm that the consumer has the card in- hand and is not using a stolen account number is requesting the card security code for e-commerce payments; it provides some merchant protection. E-commerce payments can use additional, stronger cardholder verification methods including address verification, which checks the address provided by the consumer against the billing information on file with the card issuer. Other methods provide additional cardholder verification using a customer’s pre- defined password like 3-D Secure or other payment brand or issuer payer authentication methods. 3-D Secure is not available if a merchant processes the consumer e-commerce payment “offline.” Address verification is no guarantee against fraud because criminals frequently sell address and other cardholder information together with card account information. 3-D Secure is a protocol designed to be an additional security layer for online payment card transactions, enabling consumers to authenticate their card directly with their card issuer when shopping online. 3-D Secure is offered under different names by each of the payment brands. 2.11.2 Payment Service Provider Best Practices to Detect Suspicious Activity It is the expressed intent of the PCI SSC to address matters of account data security, preventing valuable cardholder data and sensitive authentication data from being stolen. In doing so, the PCI DSS identifies security controls that must be in place to ensure that card data is sufficiently protected. In addition, Requirement 12.8.5 requires merchants to maintain a clear understanding of which controls the service provider will meet on their behalf. This can be achieved by consulting the service provider’s AOC and/or responsibility matrix. Concepts such as detection and prevention of fraud (the use of account data that has already been stolen elsewhere) are out of scope for PCI DSS. Nonetheless, fraud and data security are tightly linked. Increased adoption of fraud-detection and prevention methods will ultimately improve the effectiveness of data security efforts, as widespread industry use of such tools devalues cardholder data in the eyes of fraudsters who can no longer easily abuse stolen information online. Transaction monitoring and alerting services provided by PSPs for fraudulent transactions may also be used to track security incidents. Information Supplement • Best Practices for Securing E-commerce • April 2017 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 28 Furthermore, fraud indicators may themselves be symptomatic of compromised systems or man-in-the- middle attacks. The most common such indicator of intercepted data is transactions that suddenly originate from an unrecognized source or spoofed IP (for API transactions), or IPs that are not representative of the customer base (for redirect or Direct Post transactions). Other transaction changes—such as changes to customer information that may prevent customer alerts, accessing customer login credentials, undermining geography verification, or redirecting shipping information—may also be an indication of a hacker attempting to subvert security controls. Dips in expected transaction volume might indicate that the normal process has been altered to allow the attacker to intercept transaction information. Similarly, a spike in transaction volume may represent an attempt to flush batches of intercepted transactions in order to avoid detection (as merchants tend to notice if sales were to stop altogether). For these reasons, the table of common security and fraud controls below has been included that supplement existing guidance. This information may be especially relevant to merchants who are evaluating the use of a service provider to provide secure e-commerce payment processing solutions through APIs, redirects, and Direct Posts (see Section 2). Common Security and Fraud Control Services Service Description Instant Merchant Notification A feedback loop from the PSP to the merchant ensures that the merchant is immediately informed of transactions, and can raise alerts when suspicious activity is observed that is not otherwise detected. Where this notification is passed programmatically to a merchant API endpoint (e.g., “postback”), the PSP should provide a mechanism to ensure that the destination is not changed by a malicious user or that the postback does not contain account data. Authentication It is recommended that PSPs support the use of a limited-use token that can be retrieved or generated. This method may be used to authenticate the

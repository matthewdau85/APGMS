which PCI DSS requirements are managed by each service provider, and which are managed by the entity (Requirement 12.8.54). Please be aware, however, that PCI DSS does not require the TPSP to account for all PCI DSS requirements (for example, using a compliance matrix for all its customers).  Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) D and Attestation of Compliance for Service Providers (AOC): Completed by TPSP if completing a self-assessment. These documents can be found on the PCI SSC website.  Careful review of Part 2G, ”Summary of Requirements Tested,”4 is warranted as it contains those PCI DSS requirements the TPSP has fully tested, partially tested, or not tested for each service provided. For any “Partial” or “None” responses, the entity should review to ensure the services provided are covered. If the service provided was not covered by this assessment, the entity may wish to include this in its PCI DSS assessment.  If compensating controls are used, determine why the original requirement could not be met; understand what the control is, how it is meeting the intent and rigor of the original requirement, and how the control is being maintained.  Appendix D of the SAQ, if provided, may be reviewed to understand which requirements are marked as non-applicable or not tested to know whether they are acceptable and clearly explained. 4 Refers to version 3.1 – April 2015 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 11 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016  If provided, review Part 2E, “Description of Environment”5, and Part 2D, “Payment Application”5, to determine whether they are included in the assessment for the services provided.  Review Section 3, “Validation and Attestation Details”5, to confirm the results of the assessment.  ASV Scan Report Attestation of Scan Compliance (AOSC): Provided by the TPSP’s Approved Scanning Vendor if the TPSP is providing services that are delivered via systems required to meet PCI DSS Requirement 11.2.26. Information about the AOSC is provided within the PCI DSS ASV Program Guide, available on the PCI SSC website. As with the ROC, the AOSC may be redacted to remove sensitive or confidential information.  AOSC may be reviewed for the compliance status, scan expiration date, and number of identified failing vulnerabilities in order to determine whether the particular services are covered in these scans and have passed the scan. All previous documentation may also have the validation dates tracked with periodic updates from the TPSP. The entity should also ensure all prior non-compliant issues with the TPSP have been remediated, if the remediation timeline has passed. As these various documents are requested from compliant TPSPs, the entity should also consider requesting written verification that the services being provided to the organization fall within the scope of the services covered by the AOC, ROC, SAQ, and AOSC. This provides an additional measure of assurance that the TPSP’s PCI DSS assessment is aligned with the agreed-upon services. Developing validation checklists may ensure key fields of the AOC, SAQ, ROC, or AOSC are reviewed by the management team. If the TPSP has not attained PCI DSS compliance due to an outstanding gap in its environment, it is the responsibility of the entity to determine whether or not to accept the risk of engaging that TPSP. It is recommended the entity first understand what gap the TPSP must address in order to establish compliance and the impact of that gap to its own environment. If it is determined there is an impact, the entity should establish a clear and effective plan to remediate the issues. Among other things, this may include requesting project timelines and goal milestones from the TPSP to determine whether compliance can be achieved for the services offered, within a timeframe acceptable to the entity. Once the scope and gap have been identified, an entity may need to consult with its acquirer to ensure there is no conflict with the engagement. Note: Some payment card brands require certain types of service providers to validate PCI DSS compliance. Per payment card brand rules, for certain types of services, only those service providers who are listed and deemed PCI DSS compliant may be used. If the TPSP does not intend to validate PCI DSS compliance or is not required to validate PCI DSS compliance and the entity still elects to engage the TPSP, the entity will be required to cover the applicable TPSP systems and processes under its own PCI DSS compliance assessment.

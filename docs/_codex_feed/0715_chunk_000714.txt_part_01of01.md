In the absence of specific requirements Account selection should not be offered. The account type code 1 (DE.3-2) (AS 2805-2 bit 3, positions 3 & 4) for these Transactions should be set to 00 – (Default Account) where Account Selection is not specifically offered.

EMV@ATM TERMINAL STANDARDS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 106 30 – where Account selected is Credit Account selection and downgrade For the purposes of transition to full EMV capability on Interchange Links, where it becomes necessary to downgrade a Transaction, e.g., if the bilateral link is unable to forward DE55 (chip data) and field DE.3-2 is equal to default (00) the Acquirer should, examine the application used to create the Transaction (TAG 84 in DE55) and set the account type code 1 (DE.3-2) (AS 2805-2 bit 3, positions 3 & 4) as follows: 10 – where application used was A00000038410 (eftpos Savings) 20 – where application used was A00000038420 (eftpos Cheque) 30 – (Credit account) where application selection is other AID. Further, the ATM may retrieve the Track Two Equivalent Data from the IC data. The Track Two Equivalent Data formatted in accordance with AS 3524 and clause 9.11.3 (Data Element 35) may be used to construct a Financial Request Message, which must be forwarded to the Issuer in accordance with magnetic stripe processing formats and rules (as contained in Annexure A of this ATM System Code). Where this is done the POS entry mode must accurately reflect the source of the card information. If Track Two Equivalent Data is obtained from an Australian IC Card then POS entry code “051” (contact interface) or POS entry code “071” (contactless interface) must be used in the Financial Request Message. Card verification ATMs are not required to support any form of offline data authentication so it is strongly recommended that Issuers validate the ARQC as a fraud mitigation measure. Authorisation response code Where both TAG 8A and DE.39 are present, TAG 8A shall have precedence and shall be passed to the Card unaltered. Chip decline Should the chip return an AAC (Decline) in response to the second GENERATE AC command for an Issuer approved Transaction, the Transaction is to be declined and a reversal message forwarded to the Issuer. IAC CODE SET VOLUME 6 – ATM SYSTEM CODE ANNEXURE G. EMV@ATM TERMINAL STANDARDS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 107 Transaction certificates [Deleted]97 Chained transactions ATMs may support additional Transactions without requiring the reinsertion of the Card. Single application Cards should return to the Transaction Type Selection step and use the saved encrypted PIN in any subsequent Transactions. Multi- application cards should use the same application that was selected in the first transaction for additional transactions in the same session. 98 To avoid PIN verification failures, session key changes for PIN encryption keys should not occur during any chained sequence. Further chained Transactions are not permitted subsequent to Card removal. Note that this is in contravention of PCI-DSS requirements which do not allow a PIN to be stored even if encrypted subsequent to authorisation and that PCI requirements for ATMs are currently under review such that changes may be required in the future. If the encrypted PIN has been cleared, multiple application Cards should return to the: 99 (a) Application selection step, if the Terminal offers application selection to Cardholders; or 100 (b) Account selection step, if the Terminal auto-selects the highest priority application. 101 The prompt for "Further transactions" must also provide for a short duration timeout to ensure that the PIN is erased even if the

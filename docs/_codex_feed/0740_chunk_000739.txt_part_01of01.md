purpose of this clause is to prevent malicious parties modifying the Public Keys during electronic transmission which would result in the malicious AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS NETWORK 7 party being able to decrypt the message. Many options exist for addressing this clause, including: • Send the Public Key to the recipient over email. Sender and receiver verify fingerprint of the Public Key via a phone call. • Convey the Public Key in an encrypted zip file using AES encryption and a password with a minimum length of 12 characters consisting of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. The password shall be transferred using an out-of-band communication channel. • The Public Key is stored on a thumb drive and couriered to the recipient using a tamper evident package. The serial number of the tamper evident package is conveyed to the recipient using a separate communication channel (e.g. email). • The Public Key is stored in a FIPS 140-2/140-3 approved encrypted drive and couriered to the recipient. The PIN/password shall be conveyed to the recipient using a separate communication channel. Other techniques are acceptable. All techniques must detect or prevent attempts to manipulate the Public Key during transfer from Sending to Receiving Party. REQUIREMENT #4: DATA TRANSFER MECHANISM – DATA DELIVERY Clause 3.4.1 requires that the files are transferred via SFTP, and the expectation is that the Sending Party will either operate its own SFTP solution or have access to one. REQUIREMENT #5: THIRD PARTY AUTHORISATION AND ACCESS Clause 3.5.2 specifies that when third party involvement is necessary to support the Porting process, the Primary Party with the direct relationship to the third party is responsible for either obtaining the information required to complete the generation of the MPR Data from the third party, and/or authorising the third party to directly transfer the MPR Data held by the third party to the Receiving Party. For example, if the Sending Party has a direct relationship with a third party vault provider to store the MPR Data, then the Sending Party is responsible for either obtaining the MPR Data from the vault provider or authorising the vault provider to send the MPR Data directly to the Receiving Party. It is acknowledged that the involvement of third parties not covered by the Standard creates a risk they may not comply with the data migration requirements. This risk can be mitigated if Applicable Entities seek to incorporate compliance with the Standard in their commercial agreements with relevant third parties. AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS NETWORK 8 PART 4 COMPLIANCE MONITORING AND REPORTING ANNUAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS Clause 4.4.1 requires Applicable Entities to complete and submit to AusPayNet an Annual Compliance and Monitoring Survey by 31 January each year.

PART 5 ADMINISTRATION IMPLEMENTATION TIMEFRAME Clause 5.1.2 outlines a Transition Period to give Applicable Entities time to complete any necessary development work to enable compliance with the Standard’s Requirements by the Effective Date.

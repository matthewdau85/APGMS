IAC Device Approval - Frequently Asked Questions Version 3.0 –(Effective 1 January 2025) Australian Payments Network Limited has published the IAC Device Approval Process to approve Devices, Solutions and Non-Standard Technology for use in Australia. Devices specifically approved by AusPayNet are listed on the Approved Devices List published on AusPayNet's website. Set out below are a series of Frequently Asked Questions regarding AusPayNet's Device Approval Process. Additional questions may be submitted to PAG@auspaynet.com.au. Q.1. What are the Accepted Standards for a Device? Devices that comply with Accepted Standards may be registered for use in the IAC. The Device Approval Process lists the Accepted Standards in Section 2.2.(b). The Accepted Standards are: 1. Payment Card Industry (PCI) PIN Transaction Security (PTS) Point of Interaction (POI), which may be relevant to the following devices: a. Encrypting PIN pad for ATM, Vending, AFD or Kiosk (EPP). b. Secure (encrypting) card reader (SCR). c. Secure (encrypting) card reader PIN (SCRP). d. Non-PED POI device. e. Other secure components for a PIN entry device. 2. Payment Card Industry (PCI) PIN Transaction Security (PTS) Hardware Security Module (HSM), which may be relevant to the following devices: a. Hardware Security Modules (SCMs or HSMs). b. Key-Loading Devices. c. Remote Administration. 3. Payment Card Industry (PCI) Contactless Payments on COTS (CPoC). 4. Payment Card Industry (PCI) Software-Based PIN Entry on COTS (SPoC). 5. Payment Card Industry (PCI) Mobile Payments on COTS (MPoC), full solutions only. 6. National Institute of Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 140-2 and 140-3, HSMs approved to Level 3 or 4 only. The list of Accepted Standards will be updated from time to time. Q.2. If a payments acceptance device does not meet an Accepted Standard, what are the approval pathways? Devices that do not meet an Accepted Standard are assessed through the Non-Standard Technology (NST) process for approval. The outcome of the NST Process could be: a. Approval of the Device with or without conditions. b. Limited pilot approval with conditions. c. Application Declined. Sufficient information will be included in the letter of decline to enable the applicant to understand the rationale and the technical changes or additional evidence that would be required to enable successful resubmission. Q.3. Can AusPayNet approved devices be renewed before the expiry date? If a request is received from the Device Approval Applicant, AusPayNet, in its sole discretion, may extend the Approval Period as it deems appropriate or require the Device to be evaluated under the SRA process. Factors considered by AusPayNet in making a determination as to whether to extend the Approval Period, and the term of the Approval Period include but are not limited to: a. changes in security technology b. changes to Approved Standards c. changes to the threat environment d. newly discovered vulnerabilities If AusPayNet determines in its sole discretion not to extend the Approval Period for a device, at the end of the Sunset Period the Device can no longer be used in the IAC. Q.4. Can Devices which have passed their Sunset Date be used in the IAC? Devices which have passed their sunset date are not approved for use within the IAC. The obligation to use approved devices is a threshold requirement, non-compliance is potentially subject to a fine (IAC Threshold Requirements). Threshold Requirements are not handled using Exemption Process detailed in Section 3.3 of the IAC Code Set, Vol 1. Breaches of Threshold Requirements will be managed by AusPayNet Compliance Management Program whereby an IA Participant will be required to provide the details of non- compliances in an exemption request form that must include: a. the reason for non-compliance; b. a description of the risk and a risk rating for the non-compliance; and c. a detailed remediation plan including the number of devices in market including specific timelines for each phase of the plan and provide regular updates at every Management Committee until compliance is achieved. AusPayNet will present the details at every Management Committee meeting until Compliance is achieved. Q.5. How are Payment Applications for PTS Approved Devices assessed? AusPayNet does not require independent assessment of payment applications executing on approved PTS devices. It is the responsibility of the Acquirer to ensure that the payment application is free of security vulnerabilities or other security weaknesses. Devices running multiple applications including non-payment applications must protect the payment application and its associated data from any interference or corruption caused by any other data or other application. Q.6. How are Payment Applications for PIN on COTS solutions assessed? Payment Applications are an important part of the approved solution and require security review and approval. Payment applications handle plaintext PIN and/or plaintext PAN, either directly through code developed by the app creator or indirectly by embedding a third-party SDK. Review of a Payment Application which embeds a previously approved SDK will focus on the interface to the SDK and secure coding practices of the payment application developer. This approach reduces the review workload and is consistent with MPoC Module 2. Non-payment applications executing on the same COTS platform as payment applications do not require AusPayNet or Acquirer review. Q.7. How does the Device Approval Process assess and renew ATM Devices? The IAC does not require approval of complete ATM Devices under the Device Approval Process introduced in Dec 2021. ATM devices approved prior to Dec 2021 have been removed from the AusPayNet approved devices list. There is no renewal process for ATMs.

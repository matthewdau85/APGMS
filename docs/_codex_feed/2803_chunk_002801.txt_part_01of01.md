is critical, as the opinions of individuals and organizations regarding scope may differ. In order for this to occur, the entity may wish to consider requesting to view evidence proving the scope is accurate based upon what the TPSP has claimed. As detailed in section 3.2.2, “Third-Party Service Provider Validation Documentation,” this information may be proprietary or confidential and may require redaction, remote viewing, in-person viewing, or phone discussions. Ideally, an ISA or a QSA should review the evidence provided to verify the scope is indeed applicable, appropriate, and accurate. An individual who is well-versed and experienced in network design and segmentation may also provide this expertise if an ISA or QSA is not available. Entities may also wish to consider the use of appropriate contractual provisions with TPSPs that enable and require appropriate evidence sharing, to avoid situations where the TPSP is not obligated to facilitate the evidence-sharing process. If all attempts fail to gain required evidence from the TPSP, the entity may consider requesting that the TPSP document its scope definition in writing and include a provision for the TPSP to retain the documentation for the agreed-upon duration. Additional information can be found in Section 5, “Written Agreements, Policies, and Procedures.” 4.4 Establish Communications One of the keys to the success of the entity–TPSP relationship is effective communication. Without effective communication, changes may be made by the TPSP without the entity’s awareness or agreement that may negatively impact the entity’s overall PCI DSS compliance status. Determination of a significant change will vary from entity to entity, depending on the type of change and its impact. Communications may be promoted and enhanced by establishing communication schedule as part of the onboarding process for the monitoring program, assigning the primary points of contact at the entity and the TPSP as the responsible parties for proactively communicating on important matters. If appropriate, these points of contact may also be responsible for distributing the information appropriately within the relevant organizations in a timely manner so that risk may be mitigated. The communication schedule should be reviewed and updated on an annual basis or as needed, depending on the type and impact of changes. The following topics (non-exhaustive list) may need to be communicated whenever changes occur and/or annually, as applicable.  Changes to the CDE  Changes to the entity’s or TPSP’s payment processing structure  Changes in personnel responsible for maintaining operations with the TPSP and entity  Changes in personnel involved with the due diligence initiative  Changes in processes, procedures, and methodologies that impact the CDE  All other instances where an activity will impact the scope of the entity The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

To that end, the entity may determine that it is appropriate to request supporting evidence whenever it receives a communication from the TPSP and assesses the risk to be applicable. See Section 4.3 “Gain Transparency,” above for applicable materials and methods of communication. If the entity itself will assess the PCI DSS compliance status of the TPSP—i.e., the entity will employ the services of one of its own ISAs or an external QSA to determine the TPSP’s compliance—requesting evidence annually may be appropriate to support the PCI DSS assessment. 4.6 Obtain Information about PCI DSS Compliance Section 3.2.2, “Third-Party Service Provider Validation Documentation,” provides examples of the information that may be obtained from a TPSP regarding its compliance status, whether the TPSP has been validated or is not required to validate. It is an option for entities to perform a PCI DSS compliance assessment of the applicable services provided by the TPSP by either employing the services of one of its own ISAs or an external QSA. This PCI DSS assessment should ideally be performed upon the start of the engagement. However, performing the assessment after the engagement has begun can still provide insight and a baseline to work from; and then annual assessments may be performed preferably ending a few months before the entity’s own PCI DSS assessment date to allow for any remediation necessary. As with the pitfalls detailed in Section 4.3, “Gain Transparency,” above, the effectiveness of performing this type of assessment depends on the TPSP’s willingness to provide the necessary information. Depending on the legal agreements between the parties, there may be many instances where the TPSP declines to provide proprietary and confidential information. As detailed in “Gain Transparency,” the entity may wish to request that the TPSP document its refusal to provide the information in writing, if appropriate. 4.7 Frequency of Review The following table shows the suggested frequency of review for the engagement steps: Engaging Third-party Service Providers Steps Initially As Changes Occur* Annually  Set Expectations X X X  Gain Transparency X X X  Establish Communications X X X  Request Evidence X X X  Obtain Information about PCI DSS Compliance X X The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

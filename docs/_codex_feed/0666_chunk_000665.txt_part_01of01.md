KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 32 KIF Requirements Ref B.2.5 No person with existing or prior access to any mechanism used to enforce dual control on the KGD/KID (e.g., password or physical key) has existing, prior, or future access to any other mechanism used to enforce dual control on that device. B.2.6 Plaintext keys shall never be written to any form of non-volatile storage outside of the tamper responsive envelope of an approved SCD, e.g., PED. B.2.7 Keys shall not be installed in any KGD/KID until it has been inspected by qualified staff, i.e., staff who have been specifically trained for this role, and a reasonable degree of assurance has been reached that the KGD/KID is an authentic device and has not been subject to any unauthorised physical or logical modifications or substitution. This assurance may take the form of, but not limited to, one or more of the following methods using appropriate guidelines from the supplier on how this is to be done: Physical inspection and/or testing of the equipment immediately prior to key loading; and Physical protection of the equipment. (e.g., bonded carrier, device authentication code injected by Terminal vendor and verified on receipt, tamper evident packaging, etc.). The device is delivered with secret information to allow the KIF to ascertain that the device is genuine and not compromised providing the secret information has not been erased. 37 B.2.8 The key generation device will not output any plaintext key except under dual control. Such dual control shall be enforced by the KGD/KID or the PED requiring that at least two passwords be correctly entered within a period of no more than five minutes, before the device will output/accept a key. The device shall ensure that passwords are at least 5 characters long and the characters shall be a mixture of alphanumeric where available. 12 B.2.9 Where an asymmetric key pair is generated for transfer into another device by a KGD/KID that will not use

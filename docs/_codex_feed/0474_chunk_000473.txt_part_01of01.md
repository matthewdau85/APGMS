day, within the checkpoint times outlined in the RITS Outage Runsheet and Participant Outage Runsheet contained in these Contingency Instructions. • Contingency arrangements for a Disabling Event at the SWIFT Network level. HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 132 • Contingency arrangements for HVCS payments to or from CLS Bank. During a RITS Outage, Participants must not send payments to CLS Bank using the HVCS Fallback Solution. A CLS AUD holiday could be declared in such circumstances, in accordance with the CLS Bank’s own contingency procedures. • 2.2 Document Structure • The Contingency Instructions for each of the two outage scenarios are divided into the following sections: Section Description Runsheets Checkpoint times and sequence of events for declaring a Fallback Period and using the Fallback Solution Instructions Operational Readiness: Pre-requisites and preparation for a Fallback Period. Participation: Who participates during a Fallback Period. Entering Fallback: Declaring a Fallback Period and invoking the Fallback Solution. During Fallback: Using the Fallback Solution. Exiting Fallback: Decision and processes to exit a Fallback Period. Operational Capacity: Payment volumes when using the Fallback Solution. Applying Funds: Applying funds received through the Fallback Solution to Customer accounts. 2.3 Classification of Instructions These Contingency instructions can be applied under PART 9 of these Procedures which is designed to enable orderly operation of the HVCS during a Contingency. In accordance with Clause 9.3(a) of these Procedures, Participants have a responsibility to each other, and to the system as a whole, to cooperate in resolving any processing difficulties. To the extent that such co-operation does not adversely affect its own processing environment, a Participant should provide such co-operation. There are three classifications of instructions: Rating Definition Must Participants are required to implement all ‘Must’ items. These requirements: • define a minimum level of functionality in order for a Fallback Solution to be viable and meet its objectives; • enable Participants to meet their clearing obligations and minimise disruption to Customers. Should Participants are expected to implement ‘Should’ items. These expectations: • provide instructions and guidance on aspects of the Fallback Solution that may vary based on the specifics of a Participants systems or operations. Could Participants are encouraged to consider ‘Could’ items but are not required to implement them. These considerations: • provide indications of recommended best practice. HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 133 2.4 Classification of Framework Participants These Contingency Instructions classify Participants in accordance with Clause 7.9(a) of these Procedures regarding the Back-up Computer Site a Participant must maintain in order to resume SWIFT PDS operations during a disruption to their Primary Computer Site. Back- up Computer Site tiers are based on the Participants payment values: • Tier 1 Back-up: 2.00% or more of Total National Transaction Value. • Tier 2 Back-up: up to but not including 2.00% of Total National Transaction Value. • The Total National Payment Value means the aggregate value of all payments sent and received by all Framework Participants participating in the SWIFT PDS. This aggregate value is determined using statistical data collected over a period of three consecutive calendar months, in accordance with Clause 7.9(a) of these Procedures. HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 134 3 RITS Outage Runsheet This runsheet outlines the checkpoint times and sequence of events for a HVCS Fallback Period. It is based on the following assumptions: 1) The priority is recovering RITS in order to resume normal operations. As such, a decision to declare a HVCS Fallback Period is unlikely to be taken ahead of the checkpoint times outlined. However, where a recovery of RITS has been ruled out ahead of the checkpoint times, then ensuring ongoing clearing of HVCS payments becomes a priority and a HVCS Fallback Period may be declared earlier. Once active, T-Copy mode will remain in place for the duration of the PDS Operating Day. 2) HVCS Fallback operations for the day, up to and including the submission of HVCS Exchange Summary Forms to the RBA (Step 6), should be complete by 21:00. 3) To achieve this, the decision to declare a HVCS Fallback Period should be taken by 16:00. Where it is necessary to delay this decision, the 21:00 completion time may also be delayed and the time available to Participants for clearing payments using the HVCS Fallback Solution (Step 4) may be reduced. 4) If a Disabling Event occurs after 15:00, the assumption is that a HVCS Fallback Period would not normally be required; however the RBA would assess the conditions and potential systemic impact on the day of the event. 5) In all cases, a decision to declare a HVCS Fallback Period will not be taken within one hour of a Disabling Event occurring in order to allow for sufficient investigation by the RBA. Participants should begin preparing for a potential HVCS Fallback Period when a Disabling Event occurs, but will be given a minimum of 30 minutes from when the HVCS Fallback Period is declared to the implementation of the HVCS Fallback Solution.

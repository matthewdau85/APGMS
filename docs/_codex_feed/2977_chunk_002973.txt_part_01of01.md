compliance. For example, depending on the service provided, the Provider could provide copies of log files, patch update records or firewall rule-sets that specifically apply to an individual Customer’s environment.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 30 Providers wishing to provide a PCI DSS compliant service may want to consider isolating the PCI DSS compliant services from their non-PCI DSS compliant services. This may help to simplify the compliance validation process for both the Provider and for its individual Customers. It may also help the Provider to standardize the PCI DSS compliant services being provided to its Customers.

This section explores some of these additional security considerations. 6.1 Governance, Risk and Compliance A primary challenge with cloud environments is governance, risk and compliance management, which is typically a shared responsibility between the Customer and Provider. In security, sharing undergoes rigorous scrutiny to bring clarity to both responsibility and accountability for performing certain control activities. The delineation of responsibilities emphasizes the importance of a strong governance, risk-management structure and SLAs. Without a clear governance strategy, the Customer may be unaware of issues arising from use of the cloud service, and the Provider may be unaware of issues within the Customer environment that could affect the provision of its service. During the cloud scoping, it is imperative to include the internal and external interfaces of the security architecture and demarcate the boundaries representing the governance domain of cloud user and Provider. A responsibility matrix would be an appropriate approach to clearly define the governance strategy in the cloud, particularly when documented in the SLA. This enables clarity of responsibilities between Customer and Provider for operational security and risk management. Reporting and monitoring mechanisms should be made available by the Provider to its Customers to provide assurance that effective governance is applied and maintained by the Provider throughout the service. Examples of reports include, but are not limited to: ▪ Internal audit reports ▪ Independent audit reports ▪ Vulnerability and penetration testing reports ▪ Risk and vulnerability remediation action plan 6.1.1 Risk Management Consistent with a risk management approach for in-house services, outsourced cloud services should be assessed against an organization’s risk strategy with the intent of identifying critical assets, analyzing potential risks to those assets and developing an appropriate risk treatment plan. In traditional environments, the physical location of sensitive data can be restricted to dedicated systems and jurisdictions, facilitating the identification and implementation of effective risk-mitigation controls. However, the advent of new technologies requires a reevaluation of traditional risk strategies. For example, data in cloud environments is no longer tied to a physical system or location, reducing the effectiveness of traditional security mechanisms to protect data from risk. Traditional security approaches that build security controls to protect sensitive data may therefore need to evolve to address this emerging risk environment.

As with all service Providers, Customers should follow a thorough due-diligence process (see PCI DSS Requirement 12.8) prior to engaging the Provider. The specific due-diligence process and goals will vary for each Customer; however, common objectives typically include: ▪ Confirming that the Provider has a history of sound work practices and ethical behavior and is legitimately performing the services the Customer believes it to be ▪ Understanding the Provider's operational responsibilities, such as incident response, encryption and security monitoring ▪ Verifying that the Provider is compatible with the Customer’s business image and risk profile ▪ Identifying potential risks or circumstances associated with the Provider that may affect the Customer’s operations or business ▪ Identifying elements of the service that need to be clarified, and that need to be included in contracts or SLAs Effective due diligence is not simply reading the Provider’s marketing material or relying on a Provider’s claims of PCI compliance; rather, it involves research, review and evidence collection. Customers should be sufficiently assured that they are engaging with a Provider that can meet their security and operational needs before undertaking any such engagements. The scope of the due-diligence exercise should consider, at a minimum, the topics discussed throughout this document, as applicable to a Customer’s particular requirements.

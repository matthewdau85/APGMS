provided by the Provider. Generally, the Customer can use file integrity monitoring (FIM) to monitor its own virtual environments (including data, applications and logs), while monitoring of system/device files is managed by the Provider. SaaS: The Customer does not have visibility or permission to perform scans and typically relies on the Provider for all scans, testing and monitoring. Customer and Provider Customer and Provider Provider Requirement 12: Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel. All cloud service categories: While the Provider and Customer may define agreed-upon procedures (for example, in the SLA), each party maintains its own security policies and internal procedures. Defined roles and responsibilities, training and personnel security requirements are the responsibility of each party for its respective personnel. Customers should ensure that the Provider policies and procedures are appropriate for the Customer’s risk and security needs. Incident response in particular requires awareness and coordination between both parties. Customer and Provider Customer and Provider Customer and Provider Appendix A1: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Shared Hosting Providers The requirements for shared hosting Providers to ensure separation between Customers apply to third- party provided cloud services.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 49 Appendix B: Sample Inventory This appendix provides an example inventory for components used in cloud environments. Use of an inventory can help to identify the types of components involved in delivery of the service and responsibility for securing them. This example is not intended to be applicable to any particular scenario and is intended to provide a starting point for scoping discussions between Customers and Providers. When preparing an inventory, consider the following: ▪ The type of information collected should be relevant for the Customer’s business needs as well as the Provider’s. ▪ The level of detail collected should be appropriate for both parties to reach a clear understanding of the components involved, their use and who manages/secures them. Type/Layer Component Description/Purpose Type of Component Number of Components Implementation Notes Responsibility for Securing Component Note: Actual layers will vary depending on structure of Provider service offerings. For example: firewall, OS, application, web server, hypervisor, router, database, etc. For example: is component physical, logical or virtual? Static or dynamic? Number of components used in relation to Customer’s service Defined usage, location, etc., as applicable For example: Provider only, Customer only, or shared Data Interfaces – APIs/GUIs Applications Programming stack Operating Systems Virtual Machines Virtual networking Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

For example: firewall, OS, application, web server, hypervisor, router, database, etc. For example: is component physical, logical or virtual? Static or dynamic? Number of components used in relation to Customer’s service Defined usage, location, etc., as applicable For example: Provider only, Customer only, or shared Hypervisors Containers Processing/Memory Data Storage Network devices Physical servers Physical facilities Note: This is intended as a general example only. It may be necessary to reorganize the different technology layers or define additional component characteristics as applicable to a particular environment. Additionally, entities may wish to identify responsibilities for each system component in greater detail than provided for here.

Responsibilities should always be defined in written agreements. The table below is an example of a template that can be used by Providers and Customers to communicate the responsibilities and considerations for each PCI DSS requirement include: ▪ Does the Provider perform/manage/maintain the required control? ▪ How is the control implemented, and what are the supporting processese.g., process for patch updates would include details of testing, scheduling, approvals, etc.? ▪ What layers of the cloud architecture are covered by the Provider for the requirement? What layers of the architecture are not covered by the Provider and are specifically the responsibility of the Customer? ▪ How will the Provider provide ongoing assurance or evidence to the Customer that controls are metfor example, periodic reports, real-time notifications, results of testing, etc.? PCI DSS Requirement Responsibility (Provider only, Customer only, or shared) Specific Coverage/ Scope of Customer Responsibility Specific Coverage/ Scope of Provider Responsibility How and When Provider Will Provide Evidence of Compliance to Customer 1.1 Establish firewall and router configuration standards that include the following: 1.1.1 A formal process for approving and testing all network connections and changes to the firewall and router configurations 1.1.2 Current network diagram that identifies all connections between the cardholder data environment and other networks, including any wireless networks Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

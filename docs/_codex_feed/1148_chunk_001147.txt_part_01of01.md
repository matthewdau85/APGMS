With the constant threats to payment security globally, it’s important, now more than ever, that we help secure the future of payments together. The 2022 Community Meetings continue to be an opportunity to bring the PCI SSC community together and this year we especially look forward to reconnecting in person once again! Gather together with your community for important Council updates, insights on industry trends, strategies on best practices, engaging keynotes and industry expert speakers. Plus multiple opportunities for face to face networking and connecting! We will provide you with the information and tools to help secure payment data. We lead a global, cross-industry effort to increase payment security by providing industry-driven, flexible and effective data security standards and programs that help businesses detect, mitigate and prevent criminal attacks and breaches. We encourage everyone in the global payments community to join us for this great opportunity of industry knowledge sharing. Continue to check back as we are building an exciting and engaging agenda and secure our expert speakers. Don’t miss out!

all communication attempts are documented  Attempt to obtain an explanation from the TPSP: Is too much information being requested? Note: The AOC and/or the relevant sections of the ROC may be sufficient to demonstrate the scope of the assessment and verify its compliance status. Another option to verify the TPSP’s compliance status may be to view the documentation either at the TPSP location or remotely, over a secure session.  If the TPSP has an acquiring bank, contact that bank and request assistance with the TPSP to produce the necessary information.  If all attempts to obtain the requested data have failed, it may be appropriate to involve the payment card brands.  If PCI DSS submission requirements are documented in the contract or agreement with the TPSP, notify the TPSP that the agreement terms are being enforced.  If all else fails, note in the relevant sections of the ROC under Section 4.813, “Service providers and other third parties with which the entity shares cardholder data,” the services provided by the TPSP could not be verified due to non-communication and non-cooperation.  Note the challenges of the TPSP in the monitoring program documentation and increase the risk level of the TPSP until the next review cycle. 6.2.2 Third-party Service Provider has not Validated PCI DSS Compliance If a TPSP is not advancing its PCI DSS compliance, has allowed its compliance to lapse, does not intend to validate, or is not required to validate PCI DSS compliance, consider the following actions:  Talk to the TPSP to determine the gap in compliance (e.g., which PCI DSS requirements were not met, which systems and/or processes were not compliant, which services have not been validated, etc.).  Request evidence from the TPSP to show the applicable PCI DSS requirements are being met for the required services as detailed in Section 3.2.2, “Third-Party Service Provider Validation Documentation” related to TPSPs that have not validated PCI DSS compliance. 13 Refers to revision 1.0 – April 2015 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 31 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016  If TPSP has undergone an assessment and has submitted documentation for PCI DSS validation to the payment card brands and the list(s) have not yet been updated, request a copy of the evidence submitted to verify the applicable PCI DSS requirements are being met for the services provided.  If required, notify the entity’s acquiring bank of the situation and discuss whether the acquirer has specific steps to mitigate risk (e.g., action plan, remediation activities).  If the TPSP has not yet completed PCI DSS compliance, ask for a detailed plan with deadlines for finalizing the PCI DSS compliance process; make sure the TPSP provides status checks on a regular frequency until it achieves PCI DSS compliance.  Discuss with the TPSP the frequency for checking into its PCI DSS compliance activities, recommended 30-60 days prior, to the annual PCI DSS assessment deadline.  Ensure future agreements with TPSPs are developed with the guidelines within this document in mind, and understand the organization’s positions and requirements related to PCI DSS compliance as new TPSP candidates are interviewed.  Notify the TPSP of any requirement for a notice period for any changes to the service or support of the service, to allow time for a risk assessment to determine whether the change will impact PCI DSS compliance or applicable PCI DSS requirements.  Notify any TPSP that is not required to validate PCI DSS compliance that changes in PCI DSS requirements, payment card brand mandates, or critical changes that alter the relationship with the TPSP may result in a requirement for the TPSP to validate PCI DSS compliance.  If evidence cannot be obtained from the TPSP to verify that the applicable PCI DSS requirements are being met, the TPSP environment and system components that provide the services for the entity may need to be reviewed as part of the entity’s annual PCI DSS assessment review, and may be subject to remediation effort to meet PCI DSS compliance. Note in the relevant sections of the ROC under Section 4.814, “Service providers and other third parties with which the entity shares cardholder data,” and with the applicable PCI DSS requirement, the TPSP services that are part of the assessment.  Note the challenges of the TPSP in the monitoring program documentation and consider any corresponding change in the risk level assigned to the TPSP until the next review cycle.  If PCI DSS validation requirements are documented in the contract or agreement with the TPSP, notify the TPSP that the agreement terms are being enforced. 6.2.3 Third-party Service Provider Validates PCI DSS Compliance via Inclusion within the Entity’s PCI DSS Assessment A TPSP’s service can be included within the scope of the entity’s CDE. The following are considerations for inclusion:  Confirm that this situation is acceptable to the acquirer and/or payment card brand. 14 Refers to revision 1.0 – April 2015 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 32 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016  Identify systems and process to be included within the entity’s PCI DSS assessment.  Ensure that the TPSP is

by PCI SSC in each instance. This applies whether or not the subcontracted entity or individual is already a QSA Company or an Assessor-Employee of a different QSA Company. The QSA Company must also provide to PCI SSC proof of bound insurance coverage for all such subcontractors to demonstrate policies are in accordance with QSA Program insurance coverage requirements (see Appendix B of the QSA Qualification Requirements). PCI SSC's consent to any such subcontracting shall be subject to such terms, conditions, and requirements as PCI SSC may in its sole discretion deem necessary, reasonable, or appropriate under the circumstances. Note: To obtain PCI SSC's consent to the use of a given subcontractor, please contact the QSA Program Manager at qsa@pcisecuritystandards.org. 6.4.3 Insurance The QSA Company must adhere to all requirements for insurance coverage required by PCI SSC, as outlined in Appendix B, “Insurance Coverage,” of the QSA Qualification Requirements. Prior to qualification as a QSA Company and annually thereafter, the QSA Company is required to provide a certificate to PCI SSC from each insurance company as evidence that all required insurance is in force for each region with respect to which it is qualified by PCI SSC. The certificates must state the applicable policy numbers, dates of expiration, and limits of liability. QSA Program Guide, v2.0 December 2017 Copyright 2017 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

It is the responsibility of the Primary Contact to respond to PCI SCC in a timely manner. 6.6 Assessor Portal Access to the Portal is granted once the QSA Company is qualified as a QSA Company. Assessor- Employees receive log-on instructions upon passing the QSA training exam, and PCI SSC enters their grades into the database. Primary Contacts receive a higher-level access than employees.

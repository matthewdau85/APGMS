The teens are back at school. Ah, the serenity… But then the phone rings and you hear a familiar voice. “Dad! I forgot I have training after school this afternoon. Can you send me some money so I can get something to eat?? Otherwise, I’m going to be STARVING!” Now that school is back, did you know you can use PayID to deposit money instantly into your teen’s bank account? They can create their own PayID using their phone number or an email address, inside their internet banking and link it to their account. Then, the next time they need money (and honestly, is there ever a day they don’t?) you can simply make a payment to their PayID the same way you would use a BSB and account number inside your usual banking app (aka the bank of mum or dad). They can hit refresh on their account and watch the money arrive. For more information, contact your bank.

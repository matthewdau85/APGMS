the device in components. The key material requires a secure key loading procedure and also secure storage of the key components. (c) This method is included for ‘backward compatibility’ and for a fall-back situation. (d) The key exchange procedure is the following: (i) the partners generate interchange keys in at least two XOR components and exchange paper components using a secure channel; (ii) the keys are loaded into the SCM device under dual control - the corresponding KVCs are noted for verification; the keys may also be encrypted under the KM for storage in the key data base; (iii) the partners confirm the KVCs; (iv) the paper components are stored in the secure storage (e.g., safes under dual control); (v) afterwards, the KEKs are ready for use. (e) Advantages This method is still in wide spread use across the industry. For this reason and because of its manual handling nature, it is a good fallback solution. IAC CODE SET VOLUME 4 - DEVICE REQUIREMENTS AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT PART 4 CRYPTOGRAPHIC STANDARDS AND KEY MANAGEMENT Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 17 (f) Disadvantages The extensive use of manual procedures renders subsequent key changes, as are required under IAC Rules more difficult than some of the other methods. 4.7 IAC Interchange Lines34 IAC Interchange Lines must be subject to whole-of-message encryption, excluding communications headers, using at a minimum, triple-DES and a DEA 3 (128-bit)- bit key in accordance with AS 2805.5.4. 4.7.1 IAC Interchange Line Cryptographic Management35 (a) Subject to clause 4.6, the use of transport level data encryption (e.g., IPSec) is permitted subject to the following conditions: (i) data encryption must use either triple DES with either a 112-bit or 168- bit key length, exclusive of parity bits, or AES; (ii) the data stream must be fully encrypted with the exception of communication headers; (iii) where IPSec is used, the system must be configured to use Encapsulating Security Payload, and authentication must be HMAC- SHA-1; (iv) either certificates or encrypted pre-shared secrets must be used (plain text shared secrets not acceptable); (v) tunnel termination points must be within the IA Participant’s or their trusted agent’s facilities; (vi) the facility must be supported by documented device management procedures with identified roles and responsibilities and subject to internal audit as prescribed by the IA Participant’s security policy; (vii) ownership and control of end-points must reside with the terminating IA Participant; (viii) split tunnelling is not to be used; and (ix) the minimum Diffie-Hellman MODP group size is 1536-bits; (x) Internet Key Exchange, if used, must be configured to only use main mode. Specifically, aggressive mode must NOT be used. 34 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 35 Amended effective 1/1/21, version 012 r&p 002.20 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 4 - DEVICE REQUIREMENTS AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT PART 4 CRYPTOGRAPHIC STANDARDS AND KEY MANAGEMENT Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 18 (b) Where encrypted shared-secrets are used, key management, including the process of key (secret) entry must comply with the requirements of AS 2805.6.1, especially the requirement that no one person must have the capability to access or ascertain any plain text secret or private key. 4.7.2 Key Management Practices for IAC Interchange Lines 36 Clause 4.7.2 is Confidential 4.8 Terminal Key Management 4.8.1 Terminal key management requirements For all Terminal to Acquirer Links, Acquirers must ensure that: (a) Security for Transactions from Terminal to Acquirer complies with: AS 2805.6 series; (b) PIN security and encryption complies with AS 2805.3.1 and 5.4; (c) Key management practices comply with AS 2805.6.1; (d) Message Authentication must apply to all Acquirer Links for all financial and key management messages;39 (e) the Message Authentication Code (MAC) must be calculated using a DEA 3 (128-bit key), or AES; and40 (f) an algorithm conforming to ISO 9797-1 or ISO/IEC 19772;41 36 Amended effective 1/1/20, version 010 r&p 002.19 39 Amended effective 1/1/19, version 008 r&p 002.18 40 Amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 41 Inserted effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 4 - DEVICE REQUIREMENTS AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT PART 4 CRYPTOGRAPHIC STANDARDS AND KEY MANAGEMENT Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 19 (g) all PIN cryptographic functions must be performed within an Approved Device;42 (h) an Approved device must be used for one or both of the following cryptographic operations:43 (i) MAC generation and verification functions; or (ii) Encryption and decryption functionality used for privacy of communications; (i) where MAC cryptographic functions are not performed in an Approved Device, the system components generating or verifying MACs and associated keys shall be considered part of the host system and assessed against the requirements from IAC Code Set Volume 3, clause 3.5;44 (j) Message Authentication Codes shall be used to protect all payment-related messages passing through all communication links between a terminal and the host system driving the terminals; and45 (k) for EFTPOS Terminals privacy of communication complies with AS 2805.9 or any other privacy of communication standard approved by the Management Committee. 4.8.2 Key Management Practices Clause 4.8.2 is Confidential 42 Last amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 43 Inserted effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 44 Inserted effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 45 Inserted effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 4 - DEVICE REQUIREMENTS AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT PART 4 CRYPTOGRAPHIC STANDARDS AND KEY MANAGEMENT Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055

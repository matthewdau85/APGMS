Modernisation of Tax Administration Systems (MTAS) working group – Phase 2 Overview The Modernisation of Tax Administration Systems (MTAS) Program is an ATO wide strategy aimed at improving the integrity of the tax system by working with Digital Service Providers (DSPs) and improving ATO internal systems. It will deliver enhanced processes that increase the quality of the data being collected in relation to trustees and beneficiaries and will support the ATO to better utilise the information which drives our compliance activities. In addition, MTAS will deliver sustained improvements to the tax performance with respect to trusts and beneficiaries through facilitating improved lodgment rates and lodgment accuracy leading to increased willing participation in the tax system and improve efficiency in the way the ATO administers and processes trust reporting obligations. It will also address technical disparities between the ATO and external software providers who process trust income tax data which will in turn assist the ATO accommodate future technological changes going forward. Consultation The ATO Consultation Framework underpins our consultation framework arrangements.

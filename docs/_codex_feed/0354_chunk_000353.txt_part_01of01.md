impairments, as well as their carers and supporters, were invited to complete the online survey. The survey was accessed by 260 respondents (the majority - 88% - were individuals living with vision and / or motor impairment) during the 4-week period it was open, and feedback received reinforced the key themes captured during the overall consultation. Consultation with the disability community and their supporters included input from the following organisations: • Able Australia • Australian Human Rights Commission • Australian Network on Disability • Blind Citizens Australia • Centre for Inclusive Design • Cerebral Palsy Alliance • Digital Gap Initiative • Deafblind Australia • Guide Dogs • Macular Disease Foundation • People with Disability Australia • Public Interest Advocacy Centre • Royal Society for the Blind • TCC • Vision Australia ➜ Using this document This document provides: 1. Guidelines for designing accessible and secure PIN entry, including Five Key Principles and specific design recommendations to enhance the accessibility of the PIN entry process. These Guidelines are set out in SECTION 2. 2. Supplementary Accessibility Design Considerations for designing the overall payment process, which draws on the feedback received during the consultation process, as well as existing principles of universal design. These Supplementary Accessibility Considerations are set out in SECTION 3. 3. Supporting Material and Background Information to enable payments organisations to better understand the barriers faced by people living with disability; and to provide related information and standards that should also be taken into consideration. The Supporting Material and Background Information is set out in SECTION 4. Guidelines for designing and procuring accessible PIN entry on touchscreen terminals 2 Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals 10 ➜ Key Principles The following Five Key Principles have been developed following extensive consultation, to support those involved in the design and procurement of touchscreen technology on payment devices in considering the needs of people with disability. Touchscreen Payment Device and PIN Entry Accessibility Key Principles Embed accessibility into payment projects Make equity and inclusion fundamental Overlay security and privacy as critical factors Consider the end-to-end user experience Work to increase accessibility capability and awareness Touchscreen payment device and solution projects should consider the following five key principles: Embed accessibility into payment projects by: • Establishing a business case for accessible and inclusive design • Following the Principles of Universal Design • Considering accessibility in all project phases, starting with project initiation • Allocating funding for the design and testing of solutions for accessibility • Requiring hardware and software suppliers to provide evidence of solution accessibility • Following the recommendations provided in the ABA’s ‘Every Customer Counts – Accessibility Principles for Banking Services’ 2. Guidelines for designing and procuring accessible PIN entry on touchscreen terminals Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals 11 Make equity and inclusion fundamental by: • Designing for a wide range of physical, sensory and cognitive abilities • Making user independence and dignity a priority • Ensuring that activating accessible options is not excessively burdensome for any particular cohort of the community Overlay security as a critical factor by: • Meeting the requirements set out in the AusPayNet Issuers & Acquirers Regulations and Code Set • Ensuring users are not required to share their PINs with others to be able to make payments Consider the end-to-end user experience by: • Being mindful that not everyone is able to access the payments terminal in the same way • Making simplicity, and as far as possible consistency, a priority in the solution design to minimise any cognitive burden of using the terminal and the touchscreen Work to increase accessibility capability and awareness by: • Consulting with users, particularly those with lived experiences of a range of impairments including vision and / or motor impairments, at the start of decision-making on the design and procurement of touchscreen payment solutions • Providing relevant, practical and accessible information to merchants, users and the broader community around the accessible design features of payment terminals using touchscreen technology Being independent through the use of accessibility enables me to be proud.” I don’t like people helping me pay for things when I use a card, as I like keeping my bank details to myself…” I have avoided shops with the touchscreen being the only option - this includes having to miss out on services/products that are needed.” …. had to tell complete strangers my PIN so my purchase can be completed, which puts me in an extremely vulnerable position.” Being able to perform any form of bank transaction myself provides independence…” Source: AusPayNet Disability Community Survey August 2019 The importance of independence and dignity: “ “ “ “ “ 2. GUIDELINES FOR DESIGNING AND PROCURING ACCESSIBLE PIN ENTRY ON TOUCHSCREEN TERMINALS Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals 12 ➜ Key Recommendations When designing for accessibility, and to enhance the ability of users to independently enter their PINs on touchscreen terminals, it is strongly recommended that the following factors should be included in the design and procurement process. In general, best practice is that multiple or alternate means of achieving any given outcome should be provided and should deliver equality and/or equivalence of user experience. The keypad • Where reasonable, include a tactile keypad as an alternative method for entering the PIN. • If a virtual keypad is used (a keypad that is displayed on the screen), it is recommended that it

security functions such as a Security Operation Center (SOC) or a Network Operation Center (NOC) using cloud-delivery models. The number of applicable PCI DSS requirements that fall under the responsibility of the SECaaS Provider will increase relative to the complexity of the service being provided. Merchants using SECaaS must include SECaaS service providers in the list of PCI service providers, and ensure compliance with, at the very least, PCI DSS Requirements 12.8.1 – 12.8.5 for each SECaaS service provider used. 4.4 Segmentation Considerations Outside a cloud environment, individual entity environments would normally be physically, organizationally and administratively separate from each other. Customers utilizing a public or otherwise shared cloud must ensure that their environments are adequately isolated from the other cloud tenants. In addition to enforcing separation between Customer environments, segmentation may also be desired within a Customer’s environment to isolate its CDE components from non-CDE components in order to reduce its own PCI DSS scope. Segmentation on a cloud-computing infrastructure must provide a level of isolation equivalent to that achievable through physical network separation. Mechanisms to ensure appropriate isolation may be required at the network, operating system and application layers; and most importantly, there should be guaranteed isolation of data that is stored (see Section 4.4.3, “Segmentation Technologies,” for more information). Cloud tenant environments must be isolated from each other such that they can be considered separately managed entities with no connectivity between them. Providers should test segmentation (Requirement 11.3.4) between all entities within their control at least semiannually and demonstrate results. Any systems or components shared by the Customers in multi-tenant environments, including the hypervisor and underlying systems, must not provide an access path between environments. Any shared infrastructure used to host an in-scope Customer environment would be in scope for that Customer’s PCI DSS assessment. In a hybrid environment, the responsibility for confirming segmentation is shared by the Provider and Customer. Confirming that segmentation is effectively isolating the CDE supports the Customer by simplifying and minimizing the CDE (rather than, for example, its entire on-premises network being included in its CDE). Moreover, it is the Customer’s responsibility to ensure that the link or connection to the Provider, as well as Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 17 any devices (e.g., physical router on premises, cloud gateway or peering transit networks, etc.) used to facilitate the connection, is secured and managed. A segmented cloud environment exists when the Provider enforces isolation between Customers in multi- tenant environments. Examples of how segmentation may be provided in shared cloud environments include, but are not limited to: ▪ Traditional Application Service Provider (ASP) model, where physically separate servers are provided for each Customer’s cardholder data environment (CDE) ▪ Virtualized servers that are individually dedicated to a particular Customer, including any virtualized storage such as Storage Area Networks (SANs), Network Attached Storage (NAS) or virtual database servers ▪ Environments where Customers run their applications in separate logical partitions using separate database management system images and do not share disk storage or other resources The PCI DSS assessor must validate the effectiveness of the segmentation to ensure that it provides adequate isolation. If adequate segmentation is provided between the cloud tenants (in a multi-tenant environment), only the Customer environment and the Provider-managed environment and processes would be in scope for a Customer’s PCI DSS assessment. However, if adequate segmentation is not in place or cannot be verified, the entire multi-tenant cloud environment would be in scope for all Customers’ assessments hosted in that environment. Examples of non-segmented cloud environments include but are not limited to: ▪ Environments where organizations use the same application image on the same server and are only separated by the access control system of the operating system or the application ▪ Environments where organizations use different images of an application on the same server and are only separated by the access control system of the operating system or the application ▪ Environments where organizations’ data is stored in the same instance of the database management system’s data store Without adequate segmentation, all cloud tenants of the shared infrastructure, as well as the Provider, would need to be verified as being PCI DSS compliant in order for any one Customer to be assured of the compliance of the environment. This will likely make compliance validation unachievable for the Provider or any of its Customers. 4.4.1 Segmentation Challenges Segmentation in traditional hosted environments can be applied via separate physical servers and security measures applied using known methods. The difference in a cloud environment is that there are common shared layers (such as hypervisors and virtual infrastructure layers), which can present a single point of entry (or attack) for all systems above or below those shared layers. The security applied to these layers is therefore critical not only to the security of the individual environments they support, but also to ensure that segmentation is enforced between different cloud tenant environments.

This complexity is not limited

Our goal is to provide all Digital Service Providers (DSPs) with tailored, responsive support that promptly addresses your requests and issues. Our platform, Online Services for DSPs, is available 24/7, serving as the single entry point for all DSPs to securely submit requests. These requests are triaged and assigned to the appropriate technical specialist for resolution. Online Services for DSPs is continually updated with practical guidance, procedural information, and troubleshooting resources to enable self-service. The Digital Partnership Office (DPO) works closely with our business and technical teams to maintain the quality of the information and provide visibility of common issues and faster response times. To enhance our service offering and support the growth and progression of our digital services and partners, our service model includes: specialised DPO staff to support current and new work programs partnering with a small number of industry representatives to participate and contribute to ATO strategic working groups providing more opportunities for all DSPs to collaborate with the ATO and participate in forums and working groups a commitment to improving communication and self-help information via the DSP hub in Online Services for DSPs.

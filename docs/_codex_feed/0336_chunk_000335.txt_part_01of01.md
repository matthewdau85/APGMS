P a g e | 46 AusPayNet September 2017 Figure 21 Amended, effective 22/03/06 MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 47 AusPayNet September 2017 7.3 Visual evaluation tools 7.3.1 AusPayNet Position and Layout Gauge The AusPayNet Position and Layout Gauge shown in Figure 21, is a clear overlay printed with a number of guides, includes a code-line overlay, character size guides, alignment and skew tolerance guides and examples of the size limits for extraneous ink. This is the simplest, most valuable tool for visual quality control. 7.3.2 Optical Comparator Low powered (12 x magnification), hand held loupes that have a built in reticule containing various optical overlays. The names of suppliers are available from AusPayNet. A linear scale, skew scale, tolerance bands for character alignment, the grid of 0.010 inch squares, and various sized squares are included on the reticule. The comparator can be placed over a MICR character to check for conformance to spacing using the inch scale. The vertical alignment guide and skew scale will identify non-conformance to those factors. The different sized squares can be used to estimate the size of any voids or extraneous ink present. Figure 22 MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 48 AusPayNet September 2017 The dimension grid may be used to examine the complete character to see if they conform to the size requirements, as shown in Figure 23. The strokes that make up a character may additionally be checked with the stroke width tolerance scale. Figure 23 7.3.3 Microscope A low powered (< 20 x) binocular microscope is a very useful supplement to the optical comparator or naked eye. These types of microscopes have a wide field of view and depth of focus, and their use enables rapid examination of many print defects such as voids, ink uniformity and edge irregularity. 7.3.4 RDM OCR Qualifier The OCR Qualifier combines a high-resolution scanner, a personal computer and specialised software to capture and analyse the optical dimensions of individual characters in a MICR code-line. It displays the solid shape of MICR characters and has features that enable size, shape and spacing to be accurately measured. A very useful feature is the ability to overlay the character being examined with a thick outline representing the tolerance limits for that specific character, thus providing a rapid method for examining the size and shape of characters. These can be printed out or stored on disk if a permanent record is required. 7.4 Magnetic Testers The specifications for magnetic testing equipment are detailed in ANSI Publication X9-27, 1998, “Print and Test Specifications for Magnetic Ink Printing (MICR)”. The RDM Corporation of Canada is the major supplier of magnetic testing equipment in Australia. Whilst a description of the equipment in this Publication does not constitute an endorsement of this equipment by AusPayNet, the RDM Qualifier has become the de facto standard due to the withdrawal of other manufacturers from this field. AusPayNet can supply names of suppliers of magnetic testing equipment. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 49 AusPayNet September 2017 7.4.1 RDM MICR Qualifier At the time of publication, this system is the only one that fully meets the requirements of ANSI X9-27. It consists of a document transport linked to a PC with a colour monitor. It can be linked to a printer for a permanent visual record of the test result. The instrument uses an analysis of waveforms to determine signal strength, character identification and spacing; this information then being used to check format. When calibrated correctly, this system allows quick, accurate and consistent analysis of MICR. In addition to printing the results, they can be saved to the PC’s hard drive. As the character is measured magnetically and the standards are visual, advisory instructions are often displayed for a supplementary visual check on character shape and size. 7.4.2 Table top MICR testers Less complex systems are available that do not have to be connected to a PC, and are more portable and rugged. These are thus suitable for use in a production environment, such as proof centers and cheque printers. In most cases, the read head moves past the cheque and the results are displayed on a built in display panel. The results displayed typically include signal strength, character spacing and format and waveforms. The instruments may be able to be connected to a printer and a PC if a permanent record is required. 7.4.3 Lower level testers Simple, low cost devices are available that are suitable for monitoring low volume cheque printing, such as desk-top laser MICR printers. Typically they transport the cheque past the read-head and gives a simple display of the codeline and signal strength range or for individual characters. 7.4.4 Calibration Documents Calibration documents are required to periodically check and adjust the signal measurement of the MICR testers. These can be obtained from the suppliers of the test equipment and should be changed regularly as they deteriorate with use. Details of the calibration process are contained in the user documentation of MICR testers. These documents are known as secondary reference standards and their production is carefully monitored by ANSI. The documents are usually printed with a single domestic character in the centre of the codeline and have the measured signal strength individually noted on the document.

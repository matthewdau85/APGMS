Provider's operational responsibilities, such as incident response, encryption and security monitoring ▪ Verifying that the Provider is compatible with the Customer’s business image and risk profile ▪ Identifying potential risks or circumstances associated with the Provider that may affect the Customer’s operations or business ▪ Identifying elements of the service that need to be clarified, and that need to be included in contracts or SLAs Effective due diligence is not simply reading the Provider’s marketing material or relying on a Provider’s claims of PCI compliance; rather, it involves research, review and evidence collection. Customers should be sufficiently assured that they are engaging with a Provider that can meet their security and operational needs before undertaking any such engagements. The scope of the due-diligence exercise should consider, at a minimum, the topics discussed throughout this document, as applicable to a Customer’s particular requirements. Performing a due-diligence exercise prior to engagement with the Provider does not remove the need to perform an ongoing monitoring and review of the services offered by the Provider. 6.1.3 Service Level Agreements The use of cloud services includes the deployment of a defined service model and should always be underwritten by comprehensive SLAs that conform to the international standards for cloud computing SLAs, including ISO/IEC 19086-1:2016 Information technology -- Cloud computing -- Service level agreement (SLA) framework -- Part 1: Overview and concepts. The secure delivery of any cloud service is dependent on the Provider’s personnel, processes and technologies, while the secure usage of cloud services remains the responsibility of the Customer. Typically, cloud hosting agreements are concerned with "up time" and high availability, with little or no mention or assurance of data integrity and security. However, the Customer is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the service that it is using meets its data integrity and security requirements and compliance obligations.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 33 SLAs and other written agreements between the Provider and Customer should clearly identify the delineation of responsibilities between parties, including responsibilities for implementing and managing different security controls. These SLAs form the fundamental components of the manner in which operations and security will be undertaken and as a result should be established as a prerequisite to any cloud service implementation. PCI DSS compliance validation and testing activities (with the associated controls, permissions and schedules) should also be clearly detailed in the SLA. Failure to develop and agree upon appropriate SLAs may result in issues for the Customer if the cloud service does not meet the needs and demands of its business. SLAs should be established and agreed upon as part of any contract and service negotiations. Performance, availability, integrity and confidentiality should be considered and SLAs agreed upon for each service managed or operated by the Provider. Written agreements should also cover activities and assurances to be provided by both parties upon termination of the service provision. 6.1.4 Business Continuity Plans and Disaster Recovery Organizational requirements for business continuity plans (BCP), fault tolerance, high availability and disaster recovery (DR) controls apply to the Customer’s outsourced environments as they do for Customer-managed facilities. Customers should consider whether the Provider’s continuity and recovery procedures are sufficient to meet the Customer’s organizational requirements, and the PCI DSS scope of the cloud service should include any fail-over sites and systems that might be used to store, process or transmit cardholder data in a BCP or DR situation. The ability to perform tests of the BCP and DR capabilities and to observe results of the Provider’s testing should also be considered. 6.1.5 Human Resources Management of the Provider’s human resources is largely out of the control of the Customer. The Customer’s due-diligence processes should include an understanding of the Provider’s human resources and ongoing information security awareness training practices. PCI DSS Requirements 12.6 and12.7 provide a basis for assessing the employment screening process and security awareness training program of the Provider. 6.2 Facilities and Physical Security Cloud services involve physical resources located within the Provider environment (including DR infrastructure discussed above) that are accessed remotely from the Customer’s environment. Similar to other third-party providers, Providers of public and shared clouds provide services to multiple Customers whose data and virtual components co-exist in the same physical location and are managed by the same physical systems as those of other Customers. For a Provider facility, physical security controls need to be implemented that will protect the Provider's infrastructure as well as Customers’ data. For PCI DSS validated Providers, the AOC should include a list of all physical locations that were evaluated as part of the PCI DSS compliance validation. In a private cloud, the physical location of all components is known and can be verified. When using a public cloud, different elements of the environment, such as VMs, hypervisors, virtual network devices, etc., could be Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

Verifying that appropriate physical security is in place can be challenging in an environment where data and infrastructure can be in multiple

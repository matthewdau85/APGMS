The Issuers and Acquirers Community (IAC) brings together a wide range of participants in the card payment system. Innovation The IAC is the home for industry-wide innovation and security in card payments. A current initiative is ‘open-loop’ contactless payments for transit. This allows commuters to use their own payment card (or device, such as a smart phone or wearable) to tap on and off, instead of an Opal card (closed-loop). We were instrumental in developing the framework for the contactless payments trial launched by Transport NSW in July 2017. We are now preparing Version 4 of the framework, which is scheduled for release at the end of 2019. Security Within the IAC, all payment devices used for accepting or processing sensitive card-present data are required to meet best practice security standards. Standards and approval programs ensure sensitive card data is protected and fraud is minimized. Mitigating fraud With online card fraud now accounting for 85% of all fraud on Australian cards, combatting card-not-present (CNP) fraud remains a key focus for financial institutions and card schemes. Through the IAC, we are coordinating industry-wide efforts. Most recently, on 1 July 2019, we implemented the CNP Fraud Mitigation Framework. Previous initiatives include: guidelines for issuers and acquirers outlining best practice for fraud detection, customer authentication, and data security. campaigns to create awareness of CNP fraud and prevention measures among merchants. Other campaigns to mitigate card fraud include:

and fraud prevention and management. Aggregators help to promote competition in the payments industry by providing the technology, scale and licensing required that enables smaller players to compete alongside the largest players in the industry. Collectively, these aggregators provide services to a diverse range of organisations, including building societies, credit unions, mortgage originators, smaller and regional banks, neo- banks and other fintechs (including brands such as Acorns, Square, Spriggy, Mint Payments and Adyen), as well as non-financial service organisations such as government bodies, airlines and retailers. These aggregators are actively providing access to the NPP and are collectively connecting more than 60 smaller financial institutions, thereby enabling those organisations to offer NPP payment services to their customers without having to contribute any capital to NPPA that would be required if they connected directly. We anticipate from market enquiries that there are a number of organisations providing similar services in overseas jurisdictions which are considering establishing a presence in Australia to provide NPP connectivity services, either directly or in partnership with other organisations. 2) Agency service providers A number of NPP Participants, such as the major Australian banks, are also providing (or plan to provide) third party agency services and indirect connectivity to the NPP for a number of organisations such as smaller financial institutions. It is anticipated that over time, these banks will also offer agency services to other non-bank entities such as large corporates and fintechs. Indirect access has been provided to a range of fintechs and other non-bank entities, including www.carsales.com.au, a number of cryptocurrency exchanges, and a major cross-border money transfer organisation. The recently publicised example of Assembly Payments and www.carsales.com.au 5 who are accessing the NPP via Cuscal, one of the directly connected NPP Participants, is an excellent example of how indirect connectivity is working to provide third parties with access to the NPP, as illustrated below: We anticipate seeking more such examples of indirect access emerging over time. To our knowledge, approximately 70 non-bank entities including fintechs, payment gateway providers, mortgage originators and large corporates are in active discussions with various NPP Participants regarding indirect access to the NPP. Extending access via APIs APIs will play an important role in supporting third parties who want to be able to leverage the NPP’s capabilities. NPPA has released version 1.0 of an API Framework which defines the key technical approach and mandatory data attributes for NPP APIs, aligned to ISO 20022 standards 6 . This API framework is intended to drive inter-operability, standardisation, and consistency in how organisations can use APIs to access the NPP. The initial version of the API framework focuses on standardised third-party payment initiation messages and PayID resolution requests which can be used by third parties to initiate NPP payment messages. Samples of three APIs illustrate how the framework can be used: PayID Resolution Request Payment Initiation Request Payment Status Request The API framework will be extended over time to add additional transaction types and features and to align with the domestic implementation of REST/OAuth 2.0 open banking APIs as they are developed. Work on version 2.0, which will cover additional sample APIs related to payment notification and payment return requests, is already underway and is expected to be released in early 2019. APIs for use on the NPP are currently available from some NPP Participants and are being developed by others in line with the NPPA API framework. NPPA in collaboration with SWIFT have also launched a testing / sandbox environment that will allow fintechs and other third parties to start learning and testing the benefits and capabilities of the NPP using demonstration versions of APIs defined by the NPP API Framework 7 . This API sandbox, hosted in the cloud and protected by state-of-the-art security, will help foster innovation and open up the NPP ecosystem to third parties. Together these two capabilities further open the door to the NPP’s infrastructure allowing organisations and developers to learn and test the platform’s capabilities in a way that promotes standardisation, inter-operability and a consistent experience. As NPP participating organisations continue to extend their NPP enabled services to their corporate customers and develop APIs consistent with this framework, we expect to see more and more fintechs, corporates and businesses using the NPP. In a further effort to foster the ecosystem, ensure standardisation and drive volumes on the platform, NPPA are also developing structured data standards for a number of high priority areas such as superannuation, payroll and e-invoicing. This will help ensure a consistent approach to the treatment of data, thereby making it easier for third parties to utilise the platform’s capabilities. This activity, combined with the work on APIs, is intended to support the growth of business use and commercial payment volumes on the platform. NPP Functionality The NPP has extensive capabilities today, in particular: Real-time movement of funds , 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days of the year with no cut-off times; Extensive data capabilities with the ability to carry additional data end-to-end together with the payment with the ISO 20022 message structure or via a url link to externally hosted documents. The initial service launched on the NPP, Osko, is capable of carrying up to 280 characters of remittance information; Real-time line-by-line settlement which reduces systemic risk and optimises liquidity management; and Simple addressing with the PayID Addressing Service which enables payments to be directed to an account using an

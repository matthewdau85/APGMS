an important part of the approved solution and require security review and approval. Payment applications handle plaintext PIN and/or plaintext PAN, either directly through code developed by the app creator or indirectly by embedding a third-party SDK. Review of a Payment Application which embeds a previously approved SDK will focus on the interface to the SDK and secure coding practices of the payment application developer. This approach reduces the review workload and is consistent with MPoC Module 2. Non-payment applications executing on the same COTS platform as payment applications do not require AusPayNet or Acquirer review. Q.7. How does the Device Approval Process assess and renew ATM Devices? The IAC does not require approval of complete ATM Devices under the Device Approval Process introduced in Dec 2021. ATM devices approved prior to Dec 2021 have been removed from the AusPayNet approved devices list. There is no renewal process for ATMs. The EPP component of the ATM must be approved by an Approved Standards Entity or under the AusPayNet Device Approval Process. Card readers in an ATM should be an approved device type from an Approved Standards Entity. Q.8. Major card brands have been requiring independent lab evaluations against brand specific requirements as part of their T2P or ToP pilot programs. Must these lab evaluation reports be provided to AusPayNet for a non-standard technology assessment of a COTS with PIN solution? Non-standard technology assessments require detailed design documentation and other information which enables an understanding of the risk level of the solution to be determined. Lab evaluation reports are a useful and valuable source for this information and should be provided if possible. If lab evaluation reports to card brand requirements are not provided, then equivalent information must be provided in other documentation. Q.9. Non-Standard Technologies may utilize backend systems which process plaintext PINs or PIN related keys. Must evidence of PIN security compliance be included in the submission for a non-standard technology approval? Yes, any backend solution components with PIN security related impact are required to be assessed against PCI PIN or the AusPayNet Annual Security Audit and have evidence of compliance provided for review by AusPayNet. Q.10. Can SDKs be assessed under the non-standard technology process? Yes, an SDK can be assessed and listed. An SDK is typically classified as a component because it does not implement all security controls required for the approval class. Component approvals will include conditions stating that additional approvals are needed for any solution integrating the component. Q.11. IAC Code Set Vol 1 – Annexure A Annual Security Audits requires all Non-Standard Technologies to be approved by the Company (AusPayNet). Is using an approved SDK sufficient to meet this part of the annual audit? No, an SDK is a component of an acceptance solution and will include a condition requiring an additional approval/s for the application, backend monitoring and attestation system, transaction processing backend or other components not covered under the SDK approval. The annual security audit requires the complete solution or complete device to be approved. Q.12. Can all Android platforms be used as part of Non-Standard Technology solution? No, an Android platform must use Android 9.0 or newer. Use of the hardware-backed keystore present on Android 9+ compatible mobile devices (https://source.android.com/docs/compatibility/overview) is strongly recommended. Q.13. PCI MPoC includes requirements which may be relevant to a Non-Standard Technology. Will Non-Standard Technologies which are not compliant with one or more MPoC requirements result in an automatically declined submission? No, AusPayNet uses a risk-based approach to non-standard technology assessments. Compliance gaps between a submitted solution and an Approved Standard will add to the risks considered during the non- standard technology assessment but does not automatically mean a solution is unacceptable. Q.14. What PIN block formats are acceptable for use by a Non-Standard Technology? Consistent with PCI MPoC, ISO 9564 Format 4 must be used for transport of PINs between non-standard POI technologies and the introduction to interchange. Q.15. Can 3-key TDEA be used for cryptographic protection of PINs or account data between POI and initial interchange (terminal to node) in a Non-Standard Technology? No, AES is the only symmetric algorithm allowed for use by the POI in a non-standard technology. Q.16. A fundamental security principle from PCI SPoC (Guidance, TR B3) was that PIN is kept separated from account data? Does the Non-Standard Technology program require that PIN and PAN are never present in volatile memory at the same time? No, creation of an ISO 9564 Format 4 PIN block requires the presence of the plaintext PIN and plaintext real(funding) or tokenized PAN for formation of the PIN block. The real PAN may be used in the creation of PIN blocks providing all temporary buffers are erased immediately after encryption of the PIN block. Tokenized PANs must be cryptographically bound to the plaintext real(funding) PAN. Buffers must be in volatile memory. The operating system must prevent other applications executing on the platform from accessing the buffers and the system shall include remote monitoring to detect modifications to the operating system. Q.17. PCI MPoC has a requirement that plaintext secret and private key material present in the Rich Execution Environment is unique per transaction. Does the same requirement apply to non- standard technologies under the SRA process? Yes, general purpose memory on COTS devices has limited protection and can only be used for temporary storage of one-time use data for the shortest possible duration and must be securely

verification code of the public key and associated data over an integrity assured channel such as an authenticated channel with dual controls (key verification is described in Reference 10, Clause 5.5 - see KIF Audit Guide); using authenticated encryption; when entering the public key into an SCD it shall be managed under dual control. 78 B.5.12 The devices (SCDs) involved in using public key schemes shall check the validity of other such devices involved in the communication prior to any key transport, exchange or establishment. Validation of authentication credentials shall occur immediately prior to any key establishment. 87 B.5.13 Any single clear text key component is, at all times during its transmission, conveyance, or movement between any two organizational entities: under the continuous supervision of a person with authorized access to this component; or locked in a security container (including tamper evident packaging) in such a way that it can be obtained only by a person with authorized access to it; or in a physically secure SCD. 64 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 43 KIF Requirements Ref B.5.14 When plaintext public keys are stored and are not in the form of a certificate or when their certificate has been checked and they will be used without re-checking the certificate, integrity and authenticity shall be ensured. Protection against substitution of the public key during storage is essential. For example, the substitution of a public key used for encipherment may result in a threat to data secrecy. One means of protecting a public key against substitution is to implement the same techniques as for a private key. Another means is to store the public key in a certificate, allowing verification of the key's integrity and authenticity before use. The unauthorized substitution of stored public keys shall be prevented by one or more of the following means: physically and procedurally preventing unauthorized access to the key storage area; storing a key enciphered as a function of its intended use and ensuring that it is not possible to know both a plain text value and its corresponding cipher text, enciphered under the key encipherment key; storing a certificate containing a public key and verifying the certificate prior to its use; the authenticity and integrity of the public key used to verify the certificate shall be ensured. If unauthorized key substitution is known or suspected, procedures are in place and followed to ensure that the public key is replaced with the correct public key. 79 B.5.15 The components of encryption keys shall be transferred using different communication channels per component, such as different courier services to ensure split knowledge. 65 B.5.16 Mechanisms shall exist to ensure that only authorized custodians have access to plaintext key components and place key components into tamper-evident packaging for transmittal and that only authorized custodians open tamper-evident packaging containing key components upon receipt. 66 B.5.17 Unencrypted keys are entered into host HSMs and PEDs using the principles of dual control and split knowledge. 68 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 44 KIF Requirements Ref B.5.18 The mechanisms used to load keys, such as Terminals, external PIN pads, key guns, or similar devices and methods are protected to prevent any type of monitoring (e.g., visual or logical) that could result in the unauthorized disclosure of any component. 69 B.5.19 Cryptographic keys are only used for their sole intended purpose and are never shared between production and test systems. 73 B.5.20 The following requirements are the minimum standards to be applied to Key Encrypting Keys: All Key Encrypting Keys used to transmit or convey or otherwise secure other cryptographic keys are (at least) as strong as any key they are securing; A double-length TDES key shall be enciphered by a double or triple-length TDES key, an RSA key with a key modulus of at least 1024 bits, or an AES key of at least 128 bits. RSA keys encrypting keys greater in strength than double length TDEA keys shall use a modulus of at least 2048 bits. An RSA key with a modulus of at least 1536 bits should be used to encipher double length TDES keys where ever possible; A triple-length TDES key shall be enciphered by a triple-length TDES key, a 128 bit AES key, or an RSA key with a modulus of at least 2048 bits. 67 B.5.21 The use of RSA keys with a modulus of only 1024 bits shall be treated as single use keys; TDES key transport keys shall be treated as single use keys and destroyed after use. 67 B.5.22 Procedures exist to prevent or detect the unauthorized substitution (key replacement and key misuse) of one key for another or the operation of any cryptographic device without legitimate keys. 72 B.5.23 Any known or suspected compromised key and its subsidiary keys (those keys enciphered with the compromised key) shall be replaced with a value not feasibly related to the original key. 75 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 45 KIF Requirements Ref B.5.24 Key variants are only used in devices that possess the original key. Key variants are not used at different levels of the key hierarchy e.g.,

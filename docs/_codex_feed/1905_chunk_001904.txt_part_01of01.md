Zara King is a photographer for some of Australia’s up and coming models. She also provides photos for corporate and personal events, photographs weddings, as well as providing tuition to other budding photographers. Zara says PayID gives her clients the peace of mind that their payments to her will come through successfully and without delay. “I first started to use my mobile phone number as my PayID for personal things – like splitting bills with friends at dinner. And then one day one of my business clients asked me if they could pay me with PayID, so I set up a separate one for my business account, using my email address. “PayID is quite easy to use, and it makes paying a little more accessible for my clients. If they want to get their photos quickly, it makes life a lot easier for them, and for me. “I also have students who receive single one-off tuition from me. They can pay me while they are sitting next to me and we can watch the payment arrive together,” said Zara.

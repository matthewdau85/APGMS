CEO’s corner The Election and its Implications for Payments For its second term, the Albanese Government’s main focus will be on cost-of-living pressures, housing affordability, trade wars and other geopolitical risks. Payment reforms and infrastructure modernisation initiatives will inevitably continue to be a middle shelf priority for them compared to those big picture themes. That said, we would hope to see the amendments to the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act gain traction on the legislative agenda, given they just failed to make the cut pre-election. These are important in (a) expanding the RBA’s regulatory perimeter to capture the entirety of the payments ecosystem, including payment services such as Buy Now, Pay Later and digital wallets, and (b) in providing a foundational step for payments licensing. On the latter, we would still expect an exposure draft of the first tranche of payments licensing before the end of the year, with a second tranche (including standard-setting and common access requirements) thereafter. We would also hope that – despite Stephen Jones’ retirement and the resulting need for a new Assistant Treasurer – momentum will be maintained on the Scams Prevention Framework’s regulatory codes, applying to financial institutions but also telcos and digital platforms. This remains critical, since while scam losses in Australia have fallen 36 per cent in the last two years, regulation should drive further reductions and therefore ameliorate the impact of these economic crimes, which still affect far too many Australians. Finally, we do not anticipate any impact on our transformation programs, all of which are backed by Government’s Strategic Plan for Australia’s Payments System ( Strategic Plan ), itself due for a refresh post-election: The timings for the Cheques Transition Plan are now set (by 30 June 2028 for issuance and on 30 September 2029 for acceptance), and AusPayNet has interim authorisation from the ACCC to manage the orderly wind-down of the cheques system. The RBA’s Risk Assessment on the decommissioning of BECS helpfully lays out the next steps and, similarly, AusPayNet (this time, together with AP+) has interim authorisation from the ACCC to manage this process. The focus on cybersecurity and resilience will continue to increase, emphasising the importance of AusPayNet’s AES Migration Program . Learnings from the UK It was my pleasure recently to spend a week in the UK, where I spoke at Pay360 (Europe’s largest payments event), the Global Anti-Scam Summit – the largest economic crime event held globally to date – and the BIS Innovation Hub’s Analytics Challenge. As always, I learned a lot. On economic crime, there was a strong view that economic crime should be seen as a national security issue, in order to drive real government action. As an example, the question was raised as to why governments aren’t acting to halt the existence of scam compounds (where their location is known), to truly stop scams at their source. Counter-terrorism and cyber were used as analogies, both in terms of the need for a government-sponsored national centre (like Australia’s National Anti-Scam Centre) and the need for government to immediately share intelligence on economic crime in the same way they do for terrorist and cyber-attacks. There was strong interest in the Australian approach on scams, given the reduction in scam losses here, and the perceived failings of the UK reimbursement scheme. Similarly, there was strong interest in Australia’s Strategic Plan – given the UK is currently building out how it will deliver against its National Payments Vision – and, in part because of this, our transformation initiatives around Cheques, BECS and AES. Standards, and a new Framework Notwithstanding the timing for the second tranche of payments licensing noted above, including authorisation of any standard-setting bodies, AusPayNet’s work in the standards space continues. On 1 May, our Board approved the new Standard for Payment Service Provider Porting of Merchant Payment-Related Data, on which we previously consulted . Separately, work is now underway to convert the ATM Access Code into an ATM Access Standard. Both pieces of work – and our work on the rest of our standards pipeline – will provide vital test cases on our journey to becoming an Authorised Standards-Setting Body. Alongside these standards, we now have our first new framework since 2015: on 21 March, AusPayNet launched the e-Conveyancing Payments Industry Code, which regulates financial settlement in e-Conveyancing, enhancing its security, standardisation and efficiency. The Code has been developed through collaboration between AusPayNet, the e-Conveyancing industry, financial institutions and other stakeholders, and I would like to thank them for working so closely with us to ensure the Code meets the needs of the various stakeholders involved and supports the growth and evolution of e-Conveyancing in Australia.

Payments reforms Consultation on mandating cash acceptance In February, AusPayNet responded to Treasury’s consultation on a proposed mandate for certain businesses supplying essential goods and services to accept cash as a payment method. AusPayNet's submission welcomed the Government’s commitment to ensuring that cash remains a viable means of payment for individuals in our society who want or need to use it. In this context, we acknowledged the Government’s concerns about the negative implications that could arise if an increasing number of businesses chose to no longer accept cash in the future. We understand that the cash acceptance mandate has been proposed as

with next? And so, the more traditional route is to go through these different layers of either data providers or market research focus groups to gather all of that data for your R & D teams to assemble this and to create a product and then to put online to sell. In a newer way of product creation is you go directly to this e-commerce platform, or you'd go directly to the selling point, the platform where you'll actually sell this product and get them to tell you what are your people buying, what are your users clicking on and interested in and searching for, and then telling that data to your R &D team. So, it makes product creation a lot faster. And it also reduces a lot of business risk and risk of you maybe creating a product that your R & D team thought was going to be amazing but maybe didn't actually launch very well. And then, you would have this huge load of inventory, and you now have to dump or discount somehow. And so, those were some of the projects that I worked on in my previous life. Alicia Malone: That is so fascinating! It's amazing how many elements go into predicting that consumer behavior. And another element that I want to focus on is AI. AI is transforming industries everywhere, especially in how we process and act on big data. In your experience, how is AI changing the way businesses predict that consumer behavior or market trends? Do you have any standout examples where AI has made a real impact on strategy or decision making? Sharon Gai: So, right around 2023, 2024, do you know this brand called CeraVe? It's a skincare brand. It's pretty, you can find it in all sorts of drug stores. So, they did a pretty successful campaign during the Super Bowl where they used AI to identify rising TikTok creators before these creators would hit peak virality. So, a lot of marketing teams usually have a limited amount of budget to spend to hire for a certain type of influencer. Of course, you would want the sort of mega influencers to stand behind your brand because they have better reach. Although, their reach sometimes can be too general and too broad. But this was an experiment when CeraVe, instead of using these traditional A-lister type influencers, they focused more on micro-influencers that had a higher engagement with skincare type of content. So, are you a TikTok user? Alicia Malone: Yes, I am. Sharon Gai: So am I. So, if you search within TikTok, “Derms in the Wild”, it's a campaign that CeraVe did and they were able to use social listening tools to spot these earlier trends and creators that would couple very well with the brand, but wasn't so mass in their following. And so, they were very successful in predicting who would become influential instead of hiring people who were already really influential. And that saved them a lot of money. And, following suit, whatever happens with one skincare brand usually then sort of echoes throughout the industry. And a lot of other CPG companies started to take a similar approach in using social listening tools to save more marketing budget. Alicia Malone: Well Sharon, we are very excited to see you on stage this fall as our keynote speaker at our Asia-Pacific Community Meeting in Bangkok. Without giving away your keynote, can you give us a little sneak peek at what we might expect to hear from you? What do you want audiences to take away from your presentation? Sharon Gai: So, the world of e-commerce and payments is definitely changing. So recently, Visa did their big announcement where they were going to work with tools like ChatGPT, like Perplexity, like Mistral, like Claude to embed the ability to buy something inside an LLM tool. So, their sort of vision is that people will be looking for products or searching and buying products within these LLM tools and eventually they will become our personal shopping assistants. And so, I think in the future, the payments space is going, a lot of Visa competitors and payment providers are probably going to follow suit where they're thinking of doing something similar. And so, part of my keynote is going to be sharing with everyone and updating everyone in this type of new environment where our reliance on LLMs is just going to increase. And that we used to have a saying where software ate the world and now there's a saying where AI is eating the software which is eating the world. And I think we're going to enter an era where AI agents are going to perform a lot of tasks that once were performed by humans. And so, from a knowledge work perspective, what sort of things can we start to outsource to agents? Or first of all, I mean, just educating the audience, what AI agents are and what type of tasks can they take on? What sort of agent tools can we build internally versus find a vendor to outsource to. So, that's a lot of the parts of the presentation and the takeaway is that the evolution of how AI is going to replace traditional apps and become the new interface and how payments will become more invisible, automatic and embedded.

that no-one, other than Cardholder, can associate that control number with that Cardholder without detection;55 the control number should be communicated to the Cardholder in such a way that no-one, other than the Cardholder, can access it without detection; the CSP PIN change system should have no way of associating a control number with a specific Cardholder’s name, address, account, card or phone number; the PIN advice function should exchange only strings of numbers (a control number and authentication values) with the Issuer CSP PIN change system i.e., there should be no other Cardholder identifying information, other than the control number, exchanged during the PIN change function; 55 Amended effective 29/4/16, version 003 r&p 001.16 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 3 PIN USAGE OVER OPEN NETWORKS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 22 the PIN management system should re-associate the control number with a specific account number, validate the Cardholder using the authentication values and retrieve the Cardholder PIN for that account number; the CSP PIN change system should be designed and operated under strictly enforced conditions such that no individual is able to associate a control number, PIN or authentication values with any specific card or account number; Cardholder authentication and generation of the reference PIN should be done in real-time during the session with success or failure reported back to the Cardholder. Customer select PIN Change by mobile phone PIN selection via SMS or DTMF tone signalling should not be permitted.56 The use of Internet-based PIN change on Internet-enabled mobile phones should follow the recommendations of clause 3.5.2.57 3.6 Recommendations for Issuer approved Devices used to enter PINs58 Device Guidelines59 In accordance with clause 3.3.2, only Issuer approved devices should be used for PIN entry supporting PIN change or selection or PIN and PAN registration. Such devices should be one or more of the following: 60 a functionally secure device i.e., a device that can be compromised only by physical means and whose functionality cannot be subverted through unauthorised inputs to the device (refer to ISO 9564.4); or61 a device providing a level of logical security sufficient to protect the PIN and other account data. Issuer’s actions62 Issuers should ensure that:63 Cardholders are fully educated as to their responsibilities for the management and protection of permitted personal devices; Cardholders are adequately warned about the inherent dangers in storing the PIN; 56 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 57 Last amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 58 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 59 Inserted effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 60 Amended effective 29/4/16, version 003 r&p 001.16 61 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 62 Inserted effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 63 Amended effective 29/4/16, version 003 r&p 001.16 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 3 PIN USAGE OVER OPEN NETWORKS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 23 Cardholders are provided with a means of ensuring that the communication is genuinely with the Issuer; it is possible for the Cardholder to determine that a genuine end-to-end communication with the Issuer is occurring rather than a phishing or other man-in-the-middle malware masquerading as the Issuer application; the PIN is protected with strong encryption64 between the approved personal use device and the Issuer;65 Cardholders are provided with easy access to applicable malware countermeasures for any approved personal use devices and be made aware of the risks associated with malware; PIN change, and PIN and PAN registration applications should provide a mechanism to protect the PIN during PIN entry in case man-in-the-browser or other root-kit attacks are in place, that are undetectable by common anti- virus countermeasures.66 3.7 Recommendations for PIN transmission67 PIN protection 68 PINs and associated account data transmitted between systems should be protected against disclosure, and the integrity of the PIN protected against any party eavesdropping on, or manipulating, the communications link. PIN integrity refers to the integrity of the relationship between the PIN and any associated information such as user account data.69 Issuer’s actions 70 Issuers should:71 protect the PIN during transmission by at least one of the following methods; provision of physical protection; encryption of the PIN value; or disassociation of the PIN from the account data, with PIN integrity maintained through the use of an encrypted control value; 64 See 3.1(a) 65 Amended effective 29/4/16, version 003 r&p 001.16 66 Amended effective 29/4/16, version 003 r&p 001.16 67 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 68 Inserted effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 69 Amended effective 29/4/16, version 003 r&p 001.16 70 Inserted effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 71 Amended effective 29/4/16, version 003 r&p 001.16 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 3 PIN USAGE OVER OPEN NETWORKS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 24 use transmission protocols designed such that the introduction of fraudulent messages, or modification of valid messages, does not yield any useful information concerning the PIN; use cryptographic mechanisms such that PIN integrity is ensured; where the PAN is available, only encipher PINs using one of the PIN block formats specified in ISO 9564.1 with format 3 preferred; 72 where the PAN is not available; use an encrypted control value uniquely linked to the PAN to construct the PIN block. The construction should provide the same security properties as provided by ISO PIN blocks; the method used

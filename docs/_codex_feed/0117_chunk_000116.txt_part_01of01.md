The payments industry is experiencing unprecedented transformation and it’s no surprise that this change is reflected in AusPayNet’s operating environment . The pace and scale of technology evolution is shaping a digital- first mindset and consumers are increasingly expecting a more integrated, intuitive and frictionless payment experience. Payments is caught in the wake of a rising wave of regulatory and policy reform, leveraging data and digital identity in a drive to encourage competition and responsible innovation. We are proud that AusPayNet is at the forefront of much of this change.

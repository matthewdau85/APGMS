PCI Security Standards Council Bulletin: Extension of Expiration of the PCI PTS POI v6 Security Requirements and Approvals 17 June 2025 The PTS POI v6 Security Requirements are scheduled to be retired from use for new device approvals on 30 June 2025. Without modification of the date, there would be no evaluations that result in a new approval number using these requirements after 30 June 2025. PCI SSC will continue to provide a 12-month overlap period between major versions of PTS security requirements. This allows PTS vendors time to adjust their product designs to facilitate meeting the updated security requirements. In conjunction with the publication of the PTS POI v7 Security Requirements, the PTS POI v6 Security Requirements usage for new device security approvals will be extended to 30 June 2026. The PTS POI v6 approval expiry date will also be extended 12 months from the current device approval expiry of April 2031 to April 2032. ###

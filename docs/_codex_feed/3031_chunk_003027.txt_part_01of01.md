to simplify their security and PCI DSS assessment efforts. For purposes of this case study, simplification is achieved using an embedded payment form within an iFrame on the merchant’s website. Description of Environment The hosting and website is fully managed and maintained by ShoesInc staff. A firewall is deployed between the Internet and the ShoesInc website, which is running in a demilitarized zone (DMZ) within ShoesInc’s offices. On the internal network, an ERP system is used to manage stock within the warehouse. The web server is deployed on a Windows 2012 operating system running on Microsoft IIS. The ERP software has a front-end web service component running on the DMZ web server that links to the internal ERP. A payment page iFrame is rendered within the customer browser to accept cardholder data. This payment page iFrame is received from ShoesInc’s Payment Service Provider, XYZ PSP Co. All CHD is submitted from the customer’s web browser to the PSP. Payment Flow The following diagram depicts the customer journey and cardholder data flow for ShoesInc’s iFrame e- commerce implementation.

The cardholder browses ShoesInc’s website, filling a shopping basket before reaching the payment page. 2. ShoesInc’s shopping cart embeds an iFrame with a payment form (received, in its entirety, from the PSP web server) to the customer’s web browser. 3. The customer enters all CHD into this embedded iFrame, which is submitted directly to the XYZ PSP Co., who is then responsible for handling the payment functions. 4. This link shows communication between the website and the ERP Server. No CHD is submitted to the merchant; therefore, the merchant has no cardholder data environment. ShoesInc may be eligible to validate PCI DSS compliance via self-assessment, SAQ A, which is applicable to outsourced e-commerce environments using iFrames to redirect customers to a PCI DSS compliant payment service provider. For merchants with such implementations that are required to validate PCI DSS compliance via an onsite assessment and a Report on Compliance (ROC), SAQ A can be used as a reference for applicable PCI DSS requirements. SAQ A for PCI DSS version 3.2 includes additional PCI DSS requirements to address ongoing threats to merchant web servers that redirect customers to third parties for payment processing.

Due to AutoRental’s global reach, multiple payment providers are used dependent upon the customer’s country of origin. To help integrate this into the payment process and to allow the payment journey to be fully customizable, AutoRental has made the decision to implement the payment flow using a JavaScript payment form, retrieved from the payment provider. Description of Environment The hosting and e-commerce platform (website) is fully managed and maintained by an outsourced company called PCIData Hosting. A firewall is deployed between the Internet and the AutoRental website. The AutoRental website is housed within an AutoRental demilitarized zone (DMZ) with a Microsoft SQL Server 2015 server housed within an AutoRental internal zone. The website is running on a Windows 2012 Server, using Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) and Microsoft ASP (Active Server Pages). The AutoRental DMZ and internal zone are both isolated networks for just AutoRental’s use. A payment page is generated by the website using a JavaScript payment form served from AutoRental’s PSP, XYZ PSP Co. All CHD is entered into the payment form, which is built by the website using the PSP’s JavaScript payment form. With the JavaScript payment form, the AutoRental’s website is responsible for building the payment page, albeit with JavaScript code downloaded from the PSP. The cardholder data for payment is sent from the customer’s web browser to the PSP. Payment Flow The following diagram depicts the customer journey and cardholder data flow for AutoRental’s JavaScript Created Form implementation with a payment service provider for its e-commerce platform.

The cardholder browses AutoRental’s website, filling a shopping basket before reaching the payment page. 2. The creation of AutoRental’s payment page includes building a payment form through JavaScript (received from the PSP web server) in the customer’s web browser. 3. The customer enters all CHD into this JavaScript-generated payment form, which is submitted directly to the XYZ PSP Co., who is then responsible for handling the payment functions. 4. This link shows communication between the website and the Microsoft SQL Server. Although no CHD is submitted to the AutoRental website, the payment page and form are generated per instructions from the AutoRental website. This is different from Case Study Two because here the merchant’s website produces some or all of the

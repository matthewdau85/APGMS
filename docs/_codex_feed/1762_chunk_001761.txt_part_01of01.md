As AP+ continues its focus on ensuring we better understand the needs of payment users, we held our latest End User Forum on 18 October 2023. Our End User forums are an opportunity for end users (or their representatives) to share their thoughts with us directly on the issues that matter most to them. This ensures that we have a real understanding for what matters most to end users as we move Australia’s payments ecosystem forward. The specific topics covered will be nominated for each forum – and anyone interested in attending can nominate to take part in that forum. We had great participation at our latest forum Powering the Future of Real-Time Payments in Australia , held in Sydney and hosted by AP+ Independent Director, Naomi Simson, with more than 130 people attending in person or online. Our keynote speaker joined our CEO Lynn Kraus for a fireside chat on future trends in real-time payments. The discussion was an illuminating insight in the drivers for the creation of Australia’s NPP; progress to date and new developments for the future, including work that is planned to occur as Australia moves to consolidate legacy infrastructure onto modern digital alternatives such as the NPP. Insight into the advantages and some disadvantages of real-time payments were discussed; however also recognised was the challenge that many financial institutions will face with implementing the operational infrastructure required. Our Chief Payments and Schemes Officer, Adrian Lovney, led an engaging discussion with our panellists – Adam Roberts, Vice President, Emerging Products & Partnerships at Amex, Phil Wilson-Brown, CEO and Co-founder of Fetch Pet Insurance and Michael Vander Donk, CTO of the Australian Bond Exchange. A key take-out was the call from the panellists that in approaching use of real-time payments, to really get 'under the hood', understand all the systems and processes that need to be in place, and really seek to reimagine the optimum customer experience that could be possible. The plenary was followed by workshop sessions on PayTo and Corporate Payments, led by Head of Product Innovation and Enablement, Marnie Ryan and General Manager Business Payments, Katrina Stuart, to deep dive into the practicalities of setting up a PayTo agreement and discussions on corporate payment use cases utilising real-time payments. Of particular interest were topics including how we incentivise PayTo for customers, the future roadmap of BPAY and how it will relate, and how to support diversity and innovation across the ecosystem while enabling a degree of standardisation, particularly in the area of data. The workshops kept the flow of questions going, ensuring the voices of our in-person participants were heard. There was some lively debate among participants, which was great to see!

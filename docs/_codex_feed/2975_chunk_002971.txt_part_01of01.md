PCI DSS compliance for the Customers. The Customer should confirm that the Provider is PCI DSS compliant and that the services used by the Customer were included in the Provider's PCI DSS compliance validation (see Section 5.2, “Verifying the Scope of PCI DSS Validated Services and Components”). Moreover, the Customer must still ensure that it is using the service in a compliant manner and is also ultimately responsible for the security of its CHDoutsourcing daily management of a subset of PCI DSS requirements does not remove the Customer’s responsibility to ensure that CHD is properly secured and that PCI DSS controls are met. The Customer therefore must work with the Provider to ensure that evidence is provided to verify that PCI DSS controls are maintained on an ongoing basis. An Attestation of Compliance (AOC) reflects a single point in time only; however, maintaining compliance requires ongoing monitoring and periodic confirmation (e.g., at least once per year) that controls are in place and working effectively. Even where a cloud service is validated for certain PCI DSS requirements, this validation does not automatically transfer to the Customer environments within that cloud service. For example, a Provider’s validation may have included use of up-to-date anti-virus software on the Provider’s systems; however, this validation might not extend to the individual Customer OS or VMs (such as in an IaaS service). Additionally, the Customer must still maintain compliance for all of its own operationsfor example, by ensuring that anti- virus is installed and updated on all Customer-side systems used to connect into the cloud environment. Similarly, a Customer’s PCI DSS compliance does not result in any claim of compliance for the Provider, even if the Customer’s validation included elements of the service managed by the Provider. As a result, a Customer should confirm that services provided by the Provider support its PCI DSS compliance. Regarding the applicability of one party’s PCI DSS compliance to the other, consider the following: ▪ If a Provider is compliant, this does not mean that its Customers are. ▪ If one or more of a Provider’s Customers is compliant, this does not mean that the Provider is compliant. ▪ If a Provider and the Customer are compliant, this does not mean that any other Customers are. The Provider should ensure that any service offered as being PCI DSS compliant is accompanied by a clear and unambiguous explanation, supported by appropriate evidence, detailing which aspects of the service have been validated as compliant and which have not. 5.2 Verifying the Scope of PCI DSS Validated Services and Components Customers will need to obtain details of the Provider’s PCI DSS compliance validation in order to determine whether the service they are using is wholly covered. Providers that have validated PCI DSS compliance may be included on a list published by a payment card brand or they may not; however, all PCI DSS validated Providers should be able to provide an AOC detailing the services and locations included in the PCI DSS compliance validation. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 28 The following questions may be useful for Customers to ask their Providers: ▪ How long has the Provider been PCI DSS compliant? When was its last validation? ▪ What specific services were included in the validation? ▪ For each service used by the Customer, which PCI DSS requirements were included in the validation? ▪ Was the compliance validation conducted by a PCI-qualified and trained assessor (e.g., QSA or ISA)? ▪ Has the Provider supplied information (for example, a Responsibility Matrix) to Customers that clearly delineates the PCI DSS requirements met on behalf of the Customer? ▪ What specific services, facilities and system components were included in the validation? ▪ Are there any system components that the Provider relies on for delivery of the service that were not included in the PCI DSS validation? ▪ How does the Provider ensure that Customers using the PCI DSS compliant service cannot introduce non- compliant components to the environment or bypass any PCI DSS controls? Providers should provide their Customers with evidence that clearly identifies the scope of their PCI DSS assessment, the specific PCI DSS requirements that the environment was assessed against and the date of the assessment. The Customer must have a detailed understanding of any security requirements that are not covered by the Provider and are therefore the Customer’s responsibility to implement, manage and validate as part of its own PCI DSS compliance. The Customer should discuss its needs with the Provider to determine how the Provider can provide assurance that required controls are in place. Providers that have undergone PCI DSS assessment to validate their compliance will have the results summarized in an AOC and detailed in a Report on Compliance (ROC) or Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) D for Service Providers. The Executive Summary and Scope of Work sections of the ROC should detail the scope of the assessment including the specific components, facilities and services that were assessed. Evaluation and attestation by a PCI-qualified and trained assessor provide higher levels of assurance that PCI DSS requirements were understood and testing procedures were followed. If a Provider’s assessment was not performed by a PCI-qualified and trained assessor, the Customer may wish to ask additional questions about the rigor

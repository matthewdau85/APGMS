A PAYMENT TERMINAL is the device used to take customer card payments via swipe, dip, insert, tap, or manual entry of the card number. Point-of-sale (or POS) terminal, credit card machine, PDQ terminal, or EMV/chip-enabled terminal are also names used to describe these devices. ENCRYPTION (or cryptography) makes card data unreadable to people without special information (called a key). Cryptography can be used on stored data and data transmitted over a network. Payment terminals that are part of a PCI-listed P2PE solution provide merchants the best assurance about the quality of the encryption. With a PCI- listed P2PE solution, card data is always entered directly into a PCI-approved payment terminal with something called “secure reading and exchange of data (SRED)” enabled. This approach minimizes risk to clear-text card data and protects merchants against payment-terminal exploits such as “memory scraping” malware. Any encryption that is not done within a PCI-listed P2PE should be discussed with your vendor. Accepting face-to-face card payments from your customers requires special equipment. Depending on where in the world you are located, equipment used to take payments is called by different names. Here are the types we reference in this document and what they are commonly called. A MERCHANT BANK is a bank or financial institution that processes credit and/or debit card payments on behalf of merchants. Acquirer, acquiring bank, and card or payment processor are also terms for this entity. A PAYMENT SYSTEM includes the entire process for accepting card payments. Also called the cardholder data environment (CDE), your payment system may include a payment terminal, an electronic cash register, other devices or systems connected to a payment terminal (for example, Wi-Fi for connectivity or a PC used for inventory), and the connections out to a merchant bank. It is important to use only secure payment terminals and solutions to support your payment system. An INTEGRATED PAYMENT TERMINAL is a payment terminal and electronic cash register in one, meaning it takes payments, registers and calculates transactions, and prints receipts. An ELECTRONIC CASH REGISTER (or till; may also be known as POS System) registers and calculates transactions, and may print out receipts, but it does not accept customer card payments.

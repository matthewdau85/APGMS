 What controls are in place to keep customer systems, applications, and data segregated from other customer assets and inaccessible to other customers or the TPSP’s internal network? 3.4 Documenting Results An organization should also consider fully documenting the results of its research regarding the TPSP and review of the TPSP’s compliance status. In addition to any other information and materials deemed necessary or appropriate through the due diligence process, each entity should strongly consider capturing and including the following pieces of critical data, as each will be invaluable in the future:  Anniversary date – What is the date on which compliance documentation expires, requiring revalidation to have taken place?  Compliance validation vendors – With what security and compliance vendors and assessors does the TPSP work? This may include QSAs, ASVs performing scans, etc.  Acquiring bank – If applicable, with what acquiring bank does the TPSP work?  Sponsor bank – Identify if the TPSP uses a sponsor bank for access to the payment card networks.  Area audited – What specific service areas have been validated and how do they align with the services being provided to the entity?  Nested service providers – Are there other TPSPs nested within the TPSP’s compliance? What services do the nested TPSPs provide?  Documentation of a shared responsibility model – The assessed entity should clearly document the PCI DSS requirements that are managed by each TPSP and those that are managed by the entity. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 16 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 4 Engaging the Third-Party Service Provider After successfully researching a TPSP and completing due diligence, the entity will seek to engage the TPSP. The following sections describe the important steps to consider when engaging a TPSP. 4.1 Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) An NDA with TPSPs may be practical for your organization in the pre-selection process, and before any information is shared or disclosed. NDAs at this stage should be simple and concise, and should specify the purpose and the terms of the engagement. To simplify this process, it is recommended to have NDAs prepared by your legal department (or the party who takes care of your legal matters) prior to engaging any TPSPs, and make sure that your legal department is available to review any proposed changes or to review the TPSP’s NDA document. 4.2 Set Expectations As with any project, setting the expectations of all parties involved leads to a higher chance of success. Setting expectations is critical to achieve a consistent and agreed-upon mode of operation. In addition to the other matters determined to be important by the parties, it is important to define, agree upon, and document each of the following expectations at the start of the engagement, and to review these expectations—at a minimum, annually and after a change in services—to ensure consensus is still maintained.  The entity’s fundamental goal is to clearly understand the TPSP’s PCI DSS compliance status and as a result, enable itself to achieve and maintain its own PCI DSS compliance and gain assurance that the TPSP is sufficiently safeguarding the entity’s CHD in the TPSP’s possession.  TPSP responsibility to sufficiently safeguard the entity’s CHD in its possession, in an agreed-upon manner.  The specific services provided by the TPSP to the entity.  The primary points of contact at both the entity and the TPSP. In this regard, it may be important to identify specific individuals, along with back-up personnel in case the primary point of contact (POC) is not available. Contact information including e-mail, office phone, and cell phone are also important to document. These (or other specified) individuals should be held accountable for the due diligence activities, in addition to assuming communication responsibilities, addressing incidents, and providing compliance-related information.  The entity may want to consider including in its review of and potential contract with the TPSP that the TPSP maintain the appropriate level of expertise in security and compliance relative to the service(s) they are providing to the entity. This can be especially critical for higher-risk TPSPs. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 17 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 4.3 Gain Transparency Correctly assessing the scope of the TPSP’s responsibility in safeguarding the entity’s CHD or CDE is critical, as the opinions of individuals and organizations regarding scope may differ. In order for this to occur, the entity may wish to consider requesting to view evidence proving the scope is accurate based upon what the TPSP has claimed. As detailed in section 3.2.2, “Third-Party Service Provider Validation Documentation,” this information may be proprietary or confidential and may require redaction, remote viewing, in-person viewing, or phone discussions. Ideally, an ISA or a QSA should review the evidence provided to verify the scope is indeed applicable, appropriate, and accurate. An individual who is well-versed and experienced in network design and segmentation may also provide this expertise if an ISA or QSA is not available. Entities may also wish to consider the use of appropriate contractual provisions with TPSPs that enable and require appropriate evidence sharing, to avoid situations where the TPSP is not obligated to facilitate the evidence-sharing process.

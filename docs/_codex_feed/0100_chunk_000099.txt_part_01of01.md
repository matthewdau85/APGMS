for Cross-Border Payments . A full business case assessment for interlinking the New Payments Platform was outside the scope of the study group, but the findings show clear benefits for end-users including speed, price and non-price transparency, and access. Industry participants and jurisdictions will be able to consider a range of new opportunities, such as those presented by interlinking of fast payment systems, as they strive to improve the cross-border payments global targets. Cross-Border Payments Round-Up In March, we published the latest edition of the Cross-Border Payments Round-Up , a biannual newsletter providing updates on the progress of the G20 Roadmap. Read the newsletter on AusPayNet’s website . top Economic crime update In April, the ECF met on the Gold Coast, coinciding with national law enforcement meetings. ECF working groups continue to consider how providing requested payments data to police can become more efficient. Law enforcement agencies briefed the ECF on their priorities and proposed joint operational activity to target economic crime. We were pleased to learn of recent disruption efforts by law enforcement across Australia to target cyber-enabled phishing activity, including SMS phishing and fake websites. These crimes involve the use of sophisticated technology and are reportedly linked to transnational serious and organised crime groups, and we welcome measures aimed at deterring those criminals. As mentioned earlier, AusPayNet CEO Andy White continues to represent the Australian payments industry on the National Anti-Scam Centre’s (NASC’s) Advisory Board. Additionally, our Head of Economic Crime, Toby Evans, represents the industry on the NASC’s Fusion Cell and working groups. We are pleased to hear the cross-sectoral approach to targeting scams is coinciding with reported reductions in scam losses across several categories, particularly investment scams. The annual Targeting scams report was published in April, showing a 13.1 percent decline in reported scam losses. The first Fusion Cell report (on the Investment Scams Fusion Cell) will be published shortly, alongside the quarterly NASC report. ASIC will be extending its scam website takedown capability, currently focused on investment scam sites, to include other scams, including online shopping scams. AusPayNet welcomes this action as a means of reducing card-not-present (CNP) fraud and phishing of data to facilitate other higher value scams. While reported scam losses are down, much work remains to be done across the scam lifecycle. The Government’s mandatory industry codes, Tranche Two anti-money laundering reforms, real-time data sharing across the ecosystem, and global law enforcement action will all have a meaningful impact on efforts to combat scams. top ISO 20022 migration update In March 2023, the High Value Clearing System (HVCS) successfully adopted the ISO 20022 message standard, one of the most significant transformations of the payments system in recent times. Marking the one-year anniversary of this achievement, Program Director of Australia’s ISO 20022 Industry Migration, Rob Magee, wrote about the impact of the transition, to date, as well as AusPayNet’s ongoing work to ensure the benefits and opportunities of this global standard are realised for payments system end-users. You can read Rob’s blog post on AusPayNet’s website . In April, AusPayNet announced its support for the ISO 20022 Payments Interoperability Charter, published by High Value Payments Systems Plus (HVPS+). The charter sets out principles and objectives designed to enable the evolution and interoperability of cross-border and domestic high value ISO 20022 payments.

session keys are deciphered using the Interchange Receive KEK. These deciphered keys are set up as the set of receive keys specified by the set number contained in bit 53 of the 0820 message. The Key Verification Codes (KVCs) are calculated by the receiving node and transmitted to the sending node in bit 48 of the 0830 message. (c) When the 0830 “Network Management Advice” response message is received at the node initiating the key change, the KVCs contained in the 0830 message are validated. If the KVCs are correct, the new send session key set can be used immediately. If the KVCs are invalid, new send session key set must be generated and the whole process is repeated. Sign Off Either node may terminate the transmission of financial messages by sending a “Sign Off” advice. A “Sign Off” is accomplished by the transmission of a “Network Management Advice Message” with a Network Management Information Code equal to 002. IAC CODE SET VOLUME 6 – ATM SYSTEM CODE ANNEXURE A. STANDARD INTERCHANGE SPECIFICATION Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 48 Key Change During Normal Processing A session key change can occur at any time; each node independently initiates the change of their send keys. The sender will advise their sending session keys to the receiver using a 0820 “Network Management Advice” message with a NMIC for key change (101). Once a valid response (0830 message) is received and the KVCs confirmed, the new keys can be used. A.9 Time Out Parameters Link timeouts must conform to clause 3.1. A.10 Link Reconciliation (a) Link Reconciliation will be effected by the receipt of a Reconciliation Advice Message initiated by a link end-point, typically the Acquirer, once in every 24-hour period. This message contains the sender's totals (counts and the value if appropriate) of financial and other Transactions that have occurred on the link since the previous Link Reconciliation. (b) The receiving party, typically the Issuer, acknowledges the Advice by sending a “0530” Reconciliation Advice Response message that contains its own totals of the Transactions that it has received in the settlement period. Link Reconciliation Requirements Link Reconciliation must comply to the following: (a) Only 0520/0521 reconciliation advice messages and 0530 reconciliation response messages must be used in the reconciliation process; (b) Only one reconciliation advice message per logical interchange must be sent by the Acquirer or intermediate network node, every calendar day; (c) The reconciliation advice message must contain all the totals for that link; (d) The transmission of the reconciliation advice message must indicate the end of the reconciliation period for that Acquirer or intermediate network facility; (e) The reconciliation messages must not be used as the sole basis of financial settlement; (f) Field 15, Date Settlement usage must be as follows: (i) the Acquirer, or intermediate network facility, is responsible for setting this field for all Transactions being forwarded and may change the value of the field in order to forward a Transaction.

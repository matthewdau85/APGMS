© 2020 PCI Security Standards Council LLC. What to Know Before Participating in a PCI SSC Request for Comment The PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) highly values feedback from the global payment card industry in the development of PCI security standards and programs. The Request for Comments (RFC) process is one of several ways that PCI SSC obtains feedback from stakeholders. Information about our upcoming RFCs and our RFC process can be found on our Request for Comments page. When participating in an RFC, follow these steps to ensure your time is spent effectively and to facilitate quality contributions to PCI SSC standards and programs. Read RFC Guidance and Instructions. Each RFC includes an overview and specific guidance and instructions, including information about the RFC materials, frequently asked questions, and specific guidance about the documents being reviewed. Please review this PDF prior to submitting comments, as many of your questions and comments may be addressed within this documentation. Coordinate within your organization. Work with your organization’s primary contact to consolidate and coordinate RFC Feedback – only your primary contact will be able to provide feedback. If you don’t know who your primary is, you can email participation@pcissc.org. Read the entire document and all supporting documents. It is possible that your potential comment is addressed later in the document or in a supporting document. Read all the documents first before providing comments. Plan your reviews ahead of time. Keeping informed about upcoming RFCs will help you plan resources so they can be available to review the RFC materials and collate feedback from your organization. PREPARE PCI SSC RFCs are open to assessors and to the industry via the Participating Organization (PO) membership. Not a Participating Organization, but would like to contribute to a PCI SSC RFC?

To ensure all organizations are provided the same feedback opportunities, we are unable to accept comments once the official RFC period has closed. Please submit all feedback via the portal. The portal is the central mechanism for submitting feedback; PCI SSC cannot accept emailed submissions. Avoid last minute issues. To avoid unforeseen delays or connectivity issues, aim to submit your feedback before the RFC closure date. SUBMIT Avoid including company sensitive information. Your comments will be attributed to your company name and shared with RFC participants, so avoid including confidential company information. Suggest solutions. When possible, suggest solutions to address your feedback. Suggested solutions should include specific wording additions or modifications to address the concern. If you do not have a solution, please do not repeat the comment in the suggested solution field. Do not submit duplicate comments. If you are coordinating with another organization, please submit a single set of comments rather than duplicating submissions. We review every item of feedback; identical items do not give that feedback more weight. Follow good feedback etiquette. Your feedback will be shared with other RFC participants. Remember to remain professional and collaborative. Identify section or requirement. Correctly identifying the specific section or requirement number that your feedback refers to helps avoid confusion over how you would like your comment to be addressed. Keep feedback clear and concise. There is no need to copy paragraphs of content from the RFC materials into your comment. Keep feedback on topic. There is no mechanism to respond to general questions submitted via an RFC. Keep feedback focused on the RFC materials. COMMENT Remember that RFC versions are draft only; standards will likely be different in the final released version.

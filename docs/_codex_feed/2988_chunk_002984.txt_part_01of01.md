are not covered by the Provider and are specifically the responsibility of the Customer? ▪ How will the Provider provide ongoing assurance or evidence to the Customer that controls are metfor example, periodic reports, real-time notifications, results of testing, etc.? PCI DSS Requirement Responsibility (Provider only, Customer only, or shared) Specific Coverage/ Scope of Customer Responsibility Specific Coverage/ Scope of Provider Responsibility How and When Provider Will Provide Evidence of Compliance to Customer 1.1 Establish firewall and router configuration standards that include the following: 1.1.1 A formal process for approving and testing all network connections and changes to the firewall and router configurations 1.1.2 Current network diagram that identifies all connections between the cardholder data environment and other networks, including any wireless networks Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 52 PCI DSS Requirement Responsibility (Provider only, Customer only, or shared) Specific Coverage/ Scope of Customer Responsibility Specific Coverage/ Scope of Provider Responsibility How and When Provider Will Provide Evidence of Compliance to Customer 1.1.3 Current diagram that shows all cardholder data flows across systems and networks 1.1.4 Requirements for a firewall at each Internet connection and between any demilitarized zone (DMZ) and the internal network zone 1.1.5 Description of groups, roles, and responsibilities for logical management of network components …And so on. Note: This is intended as an example only to provide a starting point for discussions between Customers and Providers. It is not intended as a requirement or an extension of PCI DSS compliance responsibilities. However, it may provide a useful tool to help to clarify responsibilities in agreements between Customers and Providers. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 53 Appendix D: PCI DSS Implementation Considerations The questions in this appendix are intended as suggestions to help start conversations between Customers and Providers in order to understand the characteristics of a particular cloud environment, which may in turn help determine whether and how PCI DSS requirements can be met in that environment. These questions alone will not determine whether or not applicable PCI DSS requirements can be met; however, they may be a useful addition to questions directly related to specific PCI DSS requirements. Information in this table incorporates guidance from the following sources: ▪ CSA Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire ▪ ENISA Information Assurance Requirements Please also refer to the PCI DSS Virtualization Guidelines for additional PCI DSS considerations for virtualization technologies. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 54 PCI DSS Requirement Considerations for Cloud Environments Build and Maintain a Secure Network Requirement 1: Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data. Requirement 2: Do not use vendor- supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters. ▪ How is separation between tenants assured? ▪ How are boundaries enforced between trusted (internal to the Customer) networks and untrusted networks (such as Provider, other Customer or public-facing networks)? ▪ Are physical or virtual firewalls used? ▪ Who manages and audits firewall configurations? ▪ How are changes to firewall and network configurations tracked and managed? ▪ What technologies are used in the provision of the cloud servicee.g., hardware, software, virtual technologies? o Is there a current list of all hardware and software components in the environment? o Can the actual components used by a particular Customer be identified? ▪ How are configuration standards assured on different components of the infrastructure? o Are API interfaces standardized? o What is the process for provisioning new components? o Are virtual images hardened before being enabled? o Are hardened images protected from unauthorized access? ▪ How are systems with high security classifications segregated from systems with low security classifications? ▪ How are shared resources (such as processing, memory and storage) managed to ensure that they cannot be manipulatedfor example, by overloadingin order to gain access to other Customer environments or data? Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 55 PCI DSS Requirement Considerations for Cloud Environments Protect Cardholder Data Requirement 3: Protect stored cardholder data. Requirement 4: Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks. ▪ Where are the known data storage locations? Where are data centers located? ▪ Which legal jurisdiction(s) applies to Customer data? ▪ Does the Provider have any business, legal or regulatory requirements that could affect retention of Customer data? ▪ How is access to Customer data restricted to only that Customer’s users and applications? ▪ How are VM images, snapshots and backups managed to prevent unnecessary capture of sensitive data? ▪ How is data securely deleted from memory and stored images? Will data remnants exist in terminated VMs? ▪ If cryptographic keys are provided by Provider, are unique keys generated for each Customer? ▪ Where are encryption/decryption processes being performed? Who controls each process? ▪ Where are cryptographic keys stored, and who controls the keys? Are data-encryption keys stored and managed separately

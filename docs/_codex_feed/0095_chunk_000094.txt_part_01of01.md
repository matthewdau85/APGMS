support the continued operation of the CDR in the banking, energy and non-bank lending sectors, progress the design of action initiation, and uplift cyber security. Cyber Security : $101.6m over five years from 2022–23 (and $11.8m per year ongoing) to support and uplift cyber security in Australia. Digital Identity : $26.9m to sustain and develop the next stage of the Digital ID program. Privacy : $45.2m over four years from 2023–24 (and $8.4m per year ongoing) for stronger privacy protection and enforcement. Scams : $86.5m over four years from 2023-24 to combat scams and online fraud (this allocation is discussed in further detail in our Economic Crime Forum update.) It is also pleasing to see outlined in Budget Paper No. 4 the recognition and targeted coordination of policy on data and digital, cyber security, privacy, digital identity, and scams. AusPayNet looks forward to continuing to work with the Government to enable competition and innovation, promote efficiency, and control and manage risk to deliver improvements for all users of the Australian payments system. Response to Review of the Retail Payments Statistics In February, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) consulted with industry participants on a review of its Retail Payments Statistics (RPS) data collection. As the most comprehensive and timely source of data on Australia’s key payments systems, the RPS is an important resource for the industry, policymakers and the wider community. However, growth in new payment methods, business models and industry participants in recent years has led to information gaps in the RPS data. In our submission to the RBA’s consultation, AusPayNet expressed support for updating the RPS in line with industry developments over the past decade. Given AusPayNet’s central role in the industry and our extensive use of the RPS data, we offered our assistance to the RBA as they work through this review. We believe that industry collaboration will be instrumental in defining a dataset that accounts for the complexity and dynamic nature of the payments industry without imposing undue burden on reporting institutions. Response to Consultation on an SMS Sender ID Registry In March, AusPayNet responded to the Australian Communications and Media Authority’s (ACMA) consultation on establishing an SMS Sender ID registry. The registry would aim to prevent scammers from impersonating trusted business and government brand names in text message headers. AusPayNet’s submission expressed support for implementing a Sender ID registry in Australia, to help protect individuals and businesses against the increasing prevalence and impact of impersonation and phishing scams. We suggested a staged implementation approach, so at least some of the benefits of an SMS Sender ID registry could begin to be realised before a nationwide model can be fully operationalised. AusPayNet welcomes the Government’s budget commitment of $10.9 million to establish and enforce an SMS Sender ID registry. We stand ready to continue assisting ACMA as it progresses the implementation of this initiative. Economic Crime Forum (ECF) update 2023-24 Federal Budget AusPayNet welcomes the Australian Government’s allocation of $86.5 million over four years to address the rising rate of scams, including: $58m over three years from 2023-4 to establish the National Anti-Scam Centre (NASC) within the ACCC to improve scam data sharing across government and the private sector, and to establish public-private sector fusion cells to target specific scam issues. AusPayNet will continue working with the ACCC on ensuring the ECF complements the functions of the NASC. $17.6m over four years from 2023-4 (and $4.4m per year ongoing) for ASIC to identify and take down phishing websites and other websites that promote investment scams, with costs to be recovered through levies under ASIC’s industry funding model. AusPayNet will engage with ASIC on the implementation of Netcraft technology to detect scam websites. As earlier stated, $10.9m over four years from 2023–24 ($2.2m per year ongoing) to ACMA and the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts to establish and enforce an SMS Sender ID registry, to impede scammers who seek to spoof industry and government brand names in message headers. The National Anti-Scam Centre (NASC) On 15 May, AusPayNet CEO Andy White and Head of Economic Crime Toby Evans attended the announcement of the NASC in Canberra, as well as a stakeholder roundtable with the ACCC, ASIC and Treasury to discuss the centre’s implementation, its use of fusion cells to target specific scam types, and cross-industry national anti-scam codes. Economic Crime Forum (ECF) The ECF continues to gain momentum as more industry and regulatory representatives from various touch points of the scam lifecycle join the group. The ECF is delivering impactful fusion and response tactics through three joint operational working groups, which aim to develop intelligence referrals and create disruption opportunities for law enforcement. These projects include UK accent bank impersonation scams, UK accent bond and term deposit scams, and remote access scams. ECF workshops have delivered ‘follow the money’ intelligence packages to ASIC and compiled biometrics data of scammers that has been disseminated to UK partners. This data will be washed against offshore holdings to aid in the identification of criminal networks and their proceeds of crime. Industry and government representatives continue to provide positive feedback that the workshops are providing the opportunity for the kind of whole of ecosystem collaboration that is imperative in stopping scams at source. Australian Financial Review 2023 Banking Summit On 28 March, AusPayNet CEO Andy White appeared on the Scams, cyber and digital trust panel at the AFR

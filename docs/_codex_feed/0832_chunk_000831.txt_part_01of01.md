Those provisions are intended to facilitate the Customers retaining full title to the Cash held for them in a Mixed Cash Pool, and transferring only possession, and not ownership, of that Cash to the Cash Handler. This Protocol amends the terms of Protocol Covered Agreements if, and only to the extent that, they relate to a Mixed Cash Pool. This Protocol does not amend the terms of Protocol Covered Agreements to the extent that they relate to Cash of a Customer that is held by the Cash Handler separately from the Cash of any other person. A party that has entered into or intends to enter into a Protocol Covered Agreement may adhere to this Protocol and be bound by its terms by completing and delivering an Adherence Letter to AusPayNet, in accordance with the provisions below. Capitalised terms used but not otherwise defined in this Protocol have the meaning given in clause 10.1 (“Definitions”). 1 Adherence to and effectiveness of Protocol 1.1 Effect of adherence By adhering to this Protocol, an Adhering Party agrees that the terms of each Protocol Covered Agreement, if any, between it and each other Adhering Party, whether executed, entered into, or deemed entered into prior to or following the Implementation Date, are amended to include the Bailment Terms, in each case with effect from the Implementation Date. 1.2 Process of adherence Adherence to this Protocol is to be evidenced by the execution and delivery to AusPayNet of an Adherence Letter, together with evidence satisfactory in form and substance to AusPayNet of the authority of the signatories to execute the Adherence Letter. Each Adhering Party: (a) agrees that the determination of the date and time of acceptance of any Adherence Letter is to be determined by AusPayNet in its absolute discretion; and (b) consents to the publication of a copy of the Protocol by AusPayNet and to the disclosure by AusPayNet of its name as an Adhering Party to the Protocol.

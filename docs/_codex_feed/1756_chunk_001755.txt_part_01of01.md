recent payments working group, discussions focused on payroll and super payments to identify the key changes and touch points needed to drive industry readiness. If you’re interested in becoming a member of DSPANZ, please visit their website. Payment Service Providers Forum This is a regular AP+ forum to hear directly from payment service providers (PSPs) and other organisations in the payments ecosystem. At recent forums, AP+ has provided an overview of the work related to transitioning payments to the NPP, including having a standard format for the submission of payment instructions and how to efficiently process large bulk files on the NPP. These discussions have highlighted some of the operational issues associated with processing account to account payments today, particularly in relation to exceptions handling. Government workshops AP+ recently hosted and participated in a series of workshops with federal and state government agencies to provide updates on the progress towards the move to the NPP and to gather valuable insights from agencies on their needs and requirements relating to the handling of high volumes of payments through BECS. This included an AP+ hosted event in Canberra, attended by key Commonwealth government agencies including Services Australia, the ATO, Treasury and RBA Banking. AP+ has also participated in a recent State and Territory Treasuries roundtable to provide further updates on our program of work. These forums serve as a crucial platform for ongoing collaboration and engagement on the move to NPP. Understanding end user requirements While the NPP currently supports payments in bulk being transitioned to the NPP, AP+ is currently working with industry to determine whether there is a more efficient way to process large bulk payment files on the NPP. As we move forward with the move to the NPP, AP+ will continue to collaborate closely with the industry to navigate the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in reshaping Australia’s payments future. The development was reported in Capital brief and FST Media . A Strategic Plan for Australia's Payments System, June 2023 Modernising Australia's Payments System, December 2023

for settlement of Evening Agreed Participant payments. HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 141 5 RITS Outage Instructions 5.1 Operational Readiness The following instructions cover items that Participants are expected to have in place in preparation for a HVCS Fallback Period. 5.1.1 Operational Readiness Participants must be operationally ready to continue to participate in the HVCS if a HVCS Fallback Period is declared. This includes: 1) being familiar with these Procedures and the Contingency Instructions; 2) being capable of making the internal system and operational changes required to send and receive payments during the HVCS Fallback Period; 3) participating in contingency test exercises coordinated by AusPayNet; and 4) ensuring staff are available and contactable at all times during the HVCS Fallback Period and during planned contingency test exercises. 5) Participants must attest to their adherence with these requirements as part of the completion of the Yearly Audit Compliance Certificate (Annexure A.2). 5.1.2 Projected ESA Balance Participants must have reliable and preferably system-based methods for tracking their bilateral net settlement obligations and projected ESA balance during a HVCS Fallback Period. Note: Depending on the nature of the Disabling Event, it may not be possible for Participants to obtain the most recent record of their ESA balance from RITS. As such, Participants must be ready to use the last-known ESA balance according to their own internal records or obtained from RITS prior to the Disabling Event. 5.1.3 Non-Current Day Payments Participants must have reliable and preferably system-based methods for preventing future- dated and back-dated payments from being sent in SWIFT T-Copy470 and for identifying fu ture-dated and back-dated payments received in error. 5.1.4 Processing Rules Participants should establish system rules required to smoothly handle differences between SWIFT T-Copy messages compared to SWIFT Y-Copy. Requirements will depend on the configuration of Participants internal systems. For example: 470 SWIFT does not perform date validations on payment messages sent to the FIN-Copy Service and as such, these messages will be delivered straight to the Receiver when T-Copy mode is in operation. HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 142 • Senders will not receive MT012 or MT019 responses from RITS for payments sent under T-Copy. Participants that rely on these messages should have a system- based method to account for this in their downstream processing. • Senders will receive a negative acknowledgement (NAK) from SWIFT with error code X09 for payments sent while the SWIFT PDS FIN-Copy Service is closed to change modes. Participants should establish system rules to process these NAK’s. Payments can be resent once the SWIFT PDS reopens in T-Copy. • Receivers will not see Field 115 or the Digital Certificate 2 field in messages received under T-Copy. In addition to this, where a payment was dispatched under Y-Copy but subsequently released under T-Copy, Receivers will also see an empty PAC trailer added to block 5 of the message. Participants that use these fields should have systems-based means to account for this in their downstream processing. 5.2 Participation The following instructions describe the extent to which Participants are expected to participate in the HVCS when a HVCS Fallback Period has been declared. 5.2.1 Extent of Participation When a HVCS Fallback Period has been declared and the SWIFT PDS is operating in T- Copy Mode: 1) All Participants must continue to accept payments received from another Participant. Instructions for applying incoming funds to Customer accounts are set out in Section 6.7. 2) Tier 1 Participants must continue to send payments in accordance with the operational capacity instructions in Section 6.6. 3) Tier 2 Participants should continue to send payments in accordance with the operational capacity instructions in Section 6.6 but can, where it determines in advance that it will not send payments, elect to opt-out, in accordance with 6.2.2. 4) All Participants must manage their forecast liquidity position during the HVCS Fallback Period, taking account of the net bilateral obligations due for settlement in the contingency batch the next day. 5.2.2 Participation Opt-Out Tier 2 Participants that do not intend to continue sending payments during a HVCS Fallback Period must have pre-agreed this arrangement with AusPayNet. Where there are extenuating circumstances in which the Tier 2 Participant needs to send payments during a HVCS Fallback Period, the Tier 2 Participant must notify and obtain prior agreement from the Receiver. Note: A list of pre-agreed Tier 2 Participants will be available from the AusPayNet Extranet site such that during a HVCS Fallback Period, it is clear that other Participants should not expect to receive payments from those on the list. HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 143 5.2.3 SWIFT Connectivity Participants must remain connected to the SWIFT PDS during the HVCS Fallback Period. That is, a Participant must not disable its connection to the SWIFT network via physical or logical means or deliberately undertake any action that would result in them being unable to send or receive payments via the SWIFT PDS. 5.3 Entering HVCS Fallback The key checkpoint times for declaring and entering a HVCS Fallback Period are set out in the RITS Outage Runsheet. In summary, where a Disabling

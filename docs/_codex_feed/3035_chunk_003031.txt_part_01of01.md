monitoring in place according to PCI DSS Requirement 11.4 and 11.5. They are also advised to ensure their own systems are being monitored for intrusions. 7.8 Implement Security Training for all Staff  Ensure all staff are trained to use systems securely and to follow defined procedures. Training should include awareness of potential security threats per PCI DSS Requirement 12.6 and the appropriate action to take in the event of a suspected breach per PCI DSS Requirement 12.10.4.  Train technical staff to manage properly security including firewalls, digital certificates, and encryption. (PCI DSS Requirement 12.6.1)  Train all internal staff to be aware of general security issues such as social engineering techniques used by unauthorized individuals to gain access to areas with cardholder data. 7.9 Other Recommendations  Assign a specific team member(s) to monitor and report on all security alerts issued by the card brands and other security websites to stay current on emerging threats. (PCI DSS Requirement 12.5.2)  Consider implementing an additional firewall between the application server and the database server to reduce further risks from the Internet-connected web server. (PCI DSS Requirement 1.3)  Limit displays of PAN to the minimum necessary for the consumer to complete their purchase. For example, once the PAN is verified, don’t display full PAN back to the consumer in the order summary or receipt. (PCI DSS Requirement 3.4)  Even though it is not a PCI DSS requirement, network segmentation is an important subject to discuss with the service provider. Segmentation may help reduce PCI DSS scope if implemented properly. A merchant is advised to ensure it understands any segmentation controls a service provider has implemented. 7.10 Best Practices for Consumer Awareness Provide awareness for consumers to protect their payment card data when making online purchases—for example:  Do not use public, untrusted computers for e-commerce transactions. Public computers may not be secure and could be capturing payment card data as it is being entered.  Do not make purchases when connected to an unsecured wireless network (for example, using your laptop computer with a public Wi-Fi connection), unless you have a personal firewall on your computer.  Be aware of “shoulder-surfing” when entering payment card data in a public location.  Keep personal computers up to date with security patches.  Always ensure your computer is running anti-virus software that is updated with the most recent virus signatures and definitions before connecting to the Internet.

For example, do not write them on a piece of paper attached to your computer (especially if you are in a public place), and do not save them in a file on a computer that is shared with others. 7.11 Resources Organizations should familiarize themselves with industry-accepted best practices and guidelines for securing e-commerce environments. There is a wide range of resources at varying levels of depth and technical detail. Examples of resources that may provide guidance and technical security data breach reports include: 7.11.1 Information Security Resources Information security resources provide an in-depth review of topics important to e-commerce, such as secure application development, analysis of attack patterns, and alerts on emerging threats:  Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) (www.owasp.org): OWASP is a global not-for- profit organization focused on improving the security of web applications. OWASP’s mission is to make application security visible so that individuals and organizations worldwide can make informed decisions about the true risks surrounding application development and security. OWASP provides a number of resources for training and application security awareness, including podcasts, e-books, online publications, news feeds, blogs, videos, conferences, and in-person classroom training. o The OWASP Development Guide is a comprehensive reference manual for designing, developing, and deploying secure web services and applications. Individual guides include Handling E-Commerce Payments, Security of Payment Cards (Credit/Debit) in E-commerce Applications, and Cornucopia E-commerce Website Edition.  The SysAdmin, Audit, Network, and Security (SANS) Institute (www.sans.org): The SANS Institute is a privately held, U.S. company providing information security resources, training, and certifications, as well as operating the Internet's early warning system—the Internet Storm Center. SANS develops, maintains, and makes available (at no cost) a large collection of research documents about various aspects of information security. SANS learning formats, include instructor-led training, webinars, and blogs.

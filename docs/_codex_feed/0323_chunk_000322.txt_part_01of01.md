column or row on the grid. Figure 10 2.2.5 Uniformity of Ink or Toner Distribution The print should be uniformly distributed within the boundaries of all characters. Uneven deposits, caused by squeeze out, haloing and the like should be avoided. These defects are most common with letterpress and impact ribbon printing. Non-impact (toner) printing can also generate a non-uniform print and the shape of characters may be altered from the ideal to account for such changes. The manufacturer’s aim is to make each character or symbol to conform to the ideal waveform, when tested on a waveform measurement system or similar test instrument. Further modification may take place as a result of reader/sorter testing. 2.2.6 Extraneous Ink or Toner Extraneous ink or toner can be any ink or toner that appears in the clear bands other than the MICR characters. If magnetic, the clear band is the MICR 5/8 inch band, or if non-magnetic the 0.300 inch optical clear band centred in the MICR clear band. Figure 11 MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 20 AusPayNet September 2017 On the front of the document, magnetic ink spots that can be contained in a 0.003 inch square may appear in any number. Larger spots that can be contained within a 0.004 inch square are only acceptable if they do not exceed one per character space and not exceed more than 5 per field. Figure 12 Non-magnetic ink within the 0.300 inch optical clear band on the front of the document must be contained within a 0.008 inch diameter circle and no closer than 0.040 inch to each other or an E-13B character. Figure 13 On the back of a document, spots of magnetic ink in the 5/8 inch MICR clear band that can be contained within a 0.006 inch square, are allowed in any number. 2.2.7 Clear Bands The Print Contrast Signal (“PCS”) level of any printing in the MICR clear band other than MICR characters must be below 0.30. The MICR characters must have a PCS greater than 0.60. Borders with a PCS more than 0.60 must not intrude into the MICR clear band and must also conform to layout requirements of the Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms. Amended, effective 19/05/08 Only the MICR characters are to be printed with magnetic ink. Printed perforations in magnetic ink or toner that may impinge on the clear band are not permitted. The reverse side of the clear band must be clear of carboning. Carbonless coatings may only be used by arrangement with the relevant Financial Institution. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 21 AusPayNet September 2017 2.2.8 Debossment Debossment is the indentation of an area into and below the surface of a document. Because this distances a magnetic character from the read head of a reader/sorter, it may cause an erroneous reading. The maximum allowable debossment is 0.0015 inch relative to the surface of the document. This defect is common with letterpress and impact ribbon printing. 2.2.9 Embossment Embossment is the build-up of print above the surface of a document. This factor has limitations placed upon it as it may cause excessive wear on the read head of a reader/sorter and generate loose magnetic particles in the equipment. The maximum allowable embossment is 0.0006 inch above the surface of a document. This defect is most commonly seen with non-impact printing. 2.2.10 Signal Strength The signal strength of MICR printing is defined as the amplitude of the waveform resulting from a DC magnetised and fully saturated character as it is moved at a specific speed past a specifically defined magnetic read head whose output is amplified with a defined transfer function. The precise specifications are contained within ANSI X9.27 – 1995, Print and Test Specifications for Magnetic Ink Printing, Annex B through E. The primary reference standard is a wire card as described in the ANSI X9.27 – 1995 specification section 3, page 51. For a more detailed explanation of signal strength see Appendix 2. The normal reference is the Domestic symbol, using peaks 3 and 5 of the ideal waveform. A signal strength test instrument is calibrated using a certified secondary reference standard which commonly has one printed Domestic symbol and a certified signal strength relative to that character. The relative signal strength is the ratio of the signal strength of the character being measured to the nominal signal for the same character, measured from the designated peak of the waveform. The allowed limits of the relative signal strength are 75% to 200% of the nominal. Where a mis-printed or otherwise unwanted character is removed the residual signal level after removal must not exceed 5% of the relative signal strength of that character. 2.2.11 Permanence Permanence is defined as the ability of MICR printed characters to retain their ability to be read magnetically and optically over the working life of the document. This requires that documents meet the specifications contained within this publication at all times during normal processing by Financial Institutions. This is of importance with impact ribbon and non-impact printing where flaking and abrasion may occur if the print is not properly adhered or fused to the paper. 2.2.12 Other Printing Factors Anti-set off spray must not be used for printing MICR documents as it adversely affects Financial Institutions’ reader/sorter equipment.

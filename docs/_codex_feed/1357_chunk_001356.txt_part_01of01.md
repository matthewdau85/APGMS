Rules as Code Proof of Concept (PoC) working group Overview The purpose of the Rules as Code (RaC) Proof of Concept (PoC) working group is to leverage members collective knowledge and experience in co-designing and evaluating the ATO’s Rules as Code PoC. The Department of Finance is providing a Rules as Code sandpit for the PoC, along with resources to implement a limited-scope ATO use case. PoC objectives include: exploring and experimenting with Rules as Code technology in a safe environment testing the feasibility of delivering ATO rules into business accounting software via API. Working group objectives include: informing ATO thinking on potential value of Rules as Code and industry implementation pathways identifying innovations and other opportunities to inform the ATO’s broader roadmap on providing greater certainty and assurance for small business, and a more seamless, digital tax experience. Working group activities include: reviewing and refining proposed rules logic (for a limited-scope ATO use case) to ensure it aligns with real-world application mapping rules logic touchpoints and defining consistent inputs and outputs for potential API integration with software in general designing and executing tests to validate rules logic and interoperability with DSP software considering possible experimental builds within DSP software to test rules consumption via API and provide results relevant to PoC design and implementation. Consultation The ATO consultation framework underpins our consultation framework arrangements. Working group dates Contact information DSPs can provide feedback or ask questions by raising a ticket in Online Services for DSPs .

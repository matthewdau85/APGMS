B.1.8 All SCDs dispatched from the facility shall be accompanied by an itemized record of the devices dispatched. The recipient shall notify the KIF of any discrepancy between the record of items sent by the facility and the SCDs actually received. B.1.9 The KIF operator shall ensure that any new staff involved within the KIF or who have access to keys or key components, are subject to appropriate probity checking (e.g., identity verification, reference check, criminal record check) such as those required for Australian Financial Services License holders for employment of Responsible Officers (RO) as outlined in ASIC policy statement (PS 146) or equivalent. IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 28 KIF Requirements Ref 74 B.1.10 Documented procedures exist and are demonstrably in use for all processes related to the operation of the KIF, including key injection, and all involved staff shall be trained and competent in the use of these procedures. 33,82 & 88 B.1.11 No wireless network connectivity is allowed to or from the KIF. B.1.12 Where the KIF participates in remote key establishment and distribution applications the following additional requirements of References 6 and 12, where they relate specifically to remote key establishment and distribution applications: Question 19 - Single Purpose Keys; Question 22 - Key Compromise Procedures; Question 25 - Limit Key Access; Question 28 - Key Administration Procedures; and Question 31 - SCD Procedures; shall be used. B.2 Key Generation (KGD) / Key Injection Devices (KID) These devices are used to generate and inject keys into a Terminal, PED or KLD. They may generate those keys or inject preloaded keys from an acquirer. To enable the loading into the device “preloaded keys” and/or sending generated keys, they will need the functionality to enable the loading of keys such as transport keys or other acquirer related keys. The handling of the acquirer related keys will be managed in accordance with the General Key Management requirements stated in clause B.5 below.76 The key generation device may be a purpose built SCD or it may be a device which contains an SCD for the key generation and storage. Accordingly, it should not be assumed that in the following requirements the term device means only an SCD unless expressly described as such. All attached cables to the device (other than the power cable) must be treated as an integral part of the device. 76 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 29 A KID is either loaded with keys for injection into a Terminal or PED or it may contain a KGD to generate the keys for injection. The KID will use an SCD to manage the storage and generation of keys. These devices (KIDs) are not used to transport keys to Terminals or PEDs outside the KIF.77 A KID is loaded with keys for injection into a Terminal or PED, e.g., the keys are generated by a acquirer and loaded into the KID. The KID will use an SCD to manage the storage and injection of keys. These devices (KIDs) are not used to transport keys to Terminals or PEDs outside the KIF.78 There are two types of device that can be used to generate and inject keys. One type of device requires tamper responsiveness and tamper evidence because a compromise of the device could disclose keys previously generated or injected by the device prior to the compromise. The other type of device requires only tamper evidence because the device retains no information that, if disclosed, could disclose any key that had been injected into a cryptographic device prior to the compromise. KIF Requirements Ref B.2.1 The generation, and/or storage of plain text keys shall be carried out within an AusPayNet approved SCD, e.g., HSM. The approval process shall include evaluation/approval of any functions specifically required for this function. Where the KGD comprises a personal computer and an SCD: the SCD is to be integral to the device or directly connected (e.g., serially); all openings on the device that are not used for key injection are securely sealed in a tamper-evident and auditable manner. Examples include USB ports, unused serial connections, PCMCIA slots, etc. 5, 11 77 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 78 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 30 KIF Requirements Ref B.2.2 Where the device (KID) handles clear text secret or private keys, at a minimum, the following controls shall be enforced for the device to be classified as an approved KID classified as an approved KID: All key generation and/or storage is handled in accordance with Requirement B.2.1 by using an SCD which is an Approved Device (KGD); That device (KID) shall meet the requirements of Annex F of Reference 4 (see KIF Audit Guide) and be approved for this use by AusPayNet. B.2.3 Where an approved KGDs and KIDs are used then: Where there is a network connection then: (i) Any connection made from or to those devices is mutually authenticated; (ii) that device shall not send or receive cleartext keys or components via the network connection; (iii) the devices must be on

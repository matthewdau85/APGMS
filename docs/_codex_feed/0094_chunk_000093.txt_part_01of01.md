CEO’s Corner For anyone who has ever had to do it, moving home is a time for both reminiscence and anticipation. So, it is at AusPayNet, as we say goodbye to our Barangaroo office – our home for the last six years – and look forward to our future at Grosvenor Place, 225 George Street, Sydney. We moved into Barangaroo on 19 May 2017 and exited exactly six years later, on 19 May 2023. Looking back, those six years feel significant. In 2017, we held our very first Australian Payment Summit. This has grown over the years – despite COVID-19 – to become the industry’s flagship annual event and a cornerstone of the insights pillar of our strategy. Our most recent Summit at the end of last year was sold out – attracting 450 attendees – and references to it appeared more than 100 times in print and broadcast news. Notable landmarks within the standards pillar of our strategy in the last six years have included: finalising the first version of our open loop transport payments framework in 2017 launching our card-not-present fraud mitigation framework in 2018 (effective from 2019), which has seen card fraud decrease from 75.0c per $1,000 in 2018 to 57.3c in 2021 publishing our world-first guidelines for accessibility in PIN entry on touchscreen terminals on 3 December 2019 (International Day of People with Disability) announcing industry agreement to increase contactless card PIN limits in 2020 to help reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in 2022, publishing our guidelines to facilitate Australian QR Code payments. Probably the most radical evolution of our role has occurred through the transformation pillar of our strategy, starting with the publication of our Future State of Payments Action Plan in 2020, and incorporating the addition of significant program management capability, which culminated – thus far – in the ISO 20022 Industry Migration on 20 March this year. As I’ve said elsewhere, this was an incredible effort by the team and the HVCS members to ensure that the industry was ready not just once but (given the European Central Bank’s delay) twice to go-live on time, on budget, and with no significant teething problems. Looking forward, the work over the last six years provides the platform for AusPayNet to continue to deliver value to the payments industry and its end-users. Within the insights pillar of our strategy, we – as an ecosystem – have a generational obligation to solve for scams, which currently affect far too many Australians. We – as a country – also have a generational opportunity to assist in these efforts by getting the regulatory settings for payments right. That work will start later this year, with consultations on changes to the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act and on the new licensing regime for payments. This work on regulation will also form the bedrock of the key initiative within the standards pillar of our strategy, namely, to become an authorised standards-setting body (ASSB) for payments. This role will become increasingly important over time, as the ASSB sets the minimum core standards for payments licensees, thus protecting consumers and supporting innovation. More immediately, under our standards pillar, we will soon launch our first new framework since 2010, the eConveyancing Framework. Finally, on the transformation pillar of our strategy, we will continue our work managing the consumer-led decline in cheques, leading the thinking on the future of the BECS Framework, and managing the ISO 20022 coexistence period through to November 2024. We are also completing work on the program initiation document for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) migration. Once initiation is approved, the AES program itself will be a significant industry undertaking, given it affects almost one million POS terminals, around 25,000 ATMs, all hardware security modules and all card networks in between. So, while we can look back proudly at our time in Barangaroo, we are excited about times ahead, as we remain firmly focused on adding value to the Australian payments industry and its end-users. We are looking forward to rolling out the welcome mat at Grosvenor Place soon! Update on payments reforms 2023-24 Federal Budget On 9 May, The Hon Dr Jim Chalmers MP delivered the 2023-24 Federal Budget.

It is also pleasing to see outlined in Budget Paper No. 4 the recognition and targeted coordination of policy on data and digital, cyber security, privacy, digital identity, and scams. AusPayNet looks forward to continuing to work with the Government to

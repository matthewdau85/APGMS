with each type of process. If there are no standardized processes or controls in place, each facility should be assessed individually. While sampling may be a useful tool to help an entity review and monitor their security controls, it is not permitted for an entity to apply PCI DSS requirements to only a sample of the systems or business facilities in scope for PCI DSS. 3.6.7 Maintaining Evidence Often, an organization will be required to demonstrate compliance with PCI DSS requirements to its acquirers, payment brands, or clients. While the security controls may be in place and effectively mitigate the security risk they are designed to address, the organization should implement mechanisms and processes to collect and maintain evidence to demonstrate compliance with PCI DSS. “Being compliant” is not equivalent to being able to demonstrate compliance. The process of demonstrating compliance includes the collection, storage, and protection of evidence for all controls and activities performed to meet PCI DSS requirements. For example, an organization may have an automated vulnerability scanning solution configured to perform monthly scans, but without retention of the necessary vulnerability scan reports, the organization might not be able to demonstrate that quarterly scans have been performed as required in PCI DSS Requirement 11.2. The timing of evidence collection can also impact the efficiency of the process⎯collecting evidence immediately after the activity has occurred rather than weeks or months afterward, can provide an opportunity to review the collected evidence to ensure it is adequate to demonstrate compliance for all of the system components in scope. The collected evidence should be directly related to the security control(s) implemented to meet a specific PCI DSS requirement, and should clearly demonstrate compliance with the requirement while providing sufficient information to allow an assessor to perform testing procedures and document the findings (see Table 1: Examples of Security Control Evidence to Support a PCI DSS Assessment,” for additional information and examples). It can be beneficial to review the “Testing Procedures” column in the PCI DSS as well as the “Reporting Instructions” column in the “PCI DSS Template for Report on Compliance.” Information Supplement • Best Practices for Maintaining PCI DSS Compliance • January 2019 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 24 Types of evidence specific to meeting the intent, Testing Procedures, and Reporting Instructions per requirement could be classified as follows: ▪ Documentation – Examples include but are not limited to policies, standards, processes, procedures, vendor documentation, log files, configuration files, acknowledgment statements, training certificates, visitor logs, etc. ▪ Interviews – Notes in work papers during interviews which support that a control is in place and functioning in accordance with defined, approved policies, standards, and procedures. ▪ Sampling – A collection of evidence based on a subset of the total population of a specific system type or functionality that is confirmed to be consistent due to the implemented security controls (In environments where sampling is not used during the assessment, the sample set may be documented as the total population.) ▪ Observation of Configuration – A validation that a configuration is consistent with the documented, approved standards. ▪ Observation of Process – A validation that a documented, approved process is consistently being upheld. The table below provides examples of evidence and an explanation of how such evidence may assist with demonstrating compliance, for a selection of PCI DSS requirements.

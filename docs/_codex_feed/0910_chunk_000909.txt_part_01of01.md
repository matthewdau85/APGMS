Items and Debit Items contained in the File, or Government File, transmitted to its Counterparty at that exchange time. If a Tier 1 Framework Participant transmits a null File or Government File to another Framework Participant it must also submit a $0 File Settlement Instruction via the RITS Low Value Settlement Service. When a Tier 1 Framework Participant is manually entering File Settlement Instructions into RITS due to a specific processing difficulty it is not necessary to manually enter $0 File Settlement Instructions. However if manual entry is being used as a business-as-usual mode of operation then entry of $0 File Settlement Instructions is still required.514 9.2.2 Rejection of File Settlement Instructions515 In the event that a File Settlement Instruction is rejected by the RITS Low Value Settlement Service, the Originator must promptly review and rectify all defects in the original File Settlement Instruction and submit a revised File Settlement Instruction, if required. The Originator should promptly notify its Counterparty, by its LVSS Contact, of the estimated timing of submission of a revised File Settlement Instruction. 510 Last amended effective 23/11/13, version 051 r&p 004.13 511 Inserted effective 16/4/99 512 Last amended effective 23/11/13, version 051 r&p 004.13 513 Amended effective 23/11/13, version 051 r&p 004.13 514 Inserted effective 20/3/13, version 049 r&p 001.13 515 Inserted effective 21/5/12, version 047 r&p 001.12 BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES PART 9: SETTLEMENT Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 95 9.2.3 Obligation to Monitor Accruing Settlement Obligation516 Each Tier 1 Framework Participant must monitor its accruing settlement obligations in RITS in the period prior to settlement. In the event that a Counterparty disputes any value or amount in an unsettled File Settlement Instruction submitted by the Originator of that instruction, it will promptly notify the Originator, by its LVSS Contact, and the provisions of clause 9.2.5 will apply. 9.2.4 Recalling File Settlement Instructions517 Subject to the rules governing RITS, an Originator may recall any File Settlement Instruction using a File Recall Instruction. If an Originator submits a File Recall Instruction in respect of a particular File Settlement Instruction, it will promptly notify the relevant LVSS Contact of the Counterparty and advise the reason for recall. The Originator must identify the defect or error in the original File Settlement Instruction, or otherwise address the reason for the recall. The Originator must promptly submit a new File Settlement Instruction via the RITS Low Value Settlement Service if a new instruction is required. 9.2.5 Disputed Amounts518 Subject to the rules governing the RITS Low Value Settlement Service, if at any time prior to settlement a Counterparty disputes any value or reference to a number of Files within a File Settlement Instruction submitted by an Originator, it will promptly notify the Originator. The Originator must review the disputed value or number in the File Settlement Instruction and, if it identifies any error, promptly: (a) submit a File Recall Instruction to recall that particular File Settlement Instruction; and (b) submit a corrected File Settlement Instruction, if required. If for any reason, the Originator is unable to recall a File Settlement Instruction in respect of which an error is identified, the error is to be rectified after settlement in accordance with the provisions of clause 4.11. This provision applies without prejudice to the right of any party to invoke the dispute resolution procedures under Part 13 of the Regulations. 516 Inserted effective 21/5/12, version 047 r&p 001.12 517 Inserted effective 21/5/12, version 047 r&p 001.12 518 Inserted effective 21/5/12, version 047 r&p 001.12 BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES PART 9: SETTLEMENT Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 96 9.2.6 Interest Adjustments 519 Where settlement in respect of any exchange of any Item is (for whatever reason) effected on a day other than the PD Day (in this clause 9.2.6, referred to as a “Deferred Settlement Obligation”), the creditor and debtor Tier 1 Framework Participants must make an adjustment of interest between them in respect of that Item calculated at the interest rate (termed the “ESR” by the Reserve Bank of Australia) payable by the Reserve Bank of Australia on overnight credit balances of Exchange Settlement Accounts held with the Reserve Bank of Australia.520 Each Tier 1 Framework Participant acknowledges that: (a) if a Deferred Settlement Obligation is included in the Nine AM (9 am) Settlement, RITS will:521 (i) calculate the interest on the net position between each Tier 1 Framework Participant for the number of days elapsed between the PD Day and the day of settlement using the ESR applicable to each of those days during that period; and522 (ii) automatically generate interest adjustment transactions for the settlement of clearing interest obligations between each Tier 1 Framework Participant and its counterparties.

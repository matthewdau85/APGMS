following instructions describe the extent to which Participants are expected participate in the HVCS when a Participant Fallback Period has been declared. Instructions for Affected Participant 6.2.1 Sending Payments The Affected Participant must use the Participant Fallback Solution provided for in these Contingency Instructions as the alternative method of sending any payments it considers to be urgent during a Participant Fallback Period. 6.2.2 Participation Opt-Out Tier 2 Participants that do not intend to use the Participant Fallback Solution if they experience a Disabling Event must have pre-agreed this arrangement with AusPayNet. Where there are extenuating circumstances in which a pre-agreed opt-out Participant needs to send payments using the Participant Fallback Solution, the Participant must obtain prior agreement AusPayNet and from the Receiver(s). Note: A list of the pre-agreed opt-out Participants will be available from the AusPayNet extranet site, such that during a Disabling Event, it is clear to other Participants that a Participant Fallback Period is unlikely to be declared. HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 150 6.2.3 Managing ESA Balance The RBA Domestic Markets Department will contact the Affected Participant where significant deviations in ESA balances are observed. Instructions for Other Participants 6.2.4 Receiving Payments All Tier 1 Participants must accept payments from an Affected Participant through the Participant Fallback Solution, in accordance with the operational capacity instructions in Section 7.6. 6.2.5 Receiving Payments All Tier 2 Participants should accept payments received from an Affected Participant through the Participant Fallback Solution, in accordance with the operational capacity instructions in Section 7.6. Refusals, if any, must be communicated to AusPayNet. 6.2.6 Sending Payments Participants must continue to use the SWIFT PDS for sending payments to the Affected Participant, whilst having regard to the possible liquidity implications and processing delays described in Clause 9.8 of these Procedures. The Participant Fallback Solution provides a means for the Affected Participant to send payments. It cannot be used as a means for the Affected Participant to receive payments outside of the SWIFT PDS. 6.2.7 Pausing Payments Participants must, to the best of their ability, pause sending payments to an Affected Participant if requested to do so by the Affected Participant. 6.3 Entering Participant Fallback An Affected Participant cannot use the Participant Fallback Solution without prior authorisation from AusPayNet. Authorisation is granted when AusPayNet, or the RBA acting on behalf of AusPayNet, formally declares a Participant Fallback Period. The key checkpoint times for declaring and entering a Participant Fallback Period are outlined in the Participant Outage Runsheet. In summary, where the Affected Participant’s Disabling Event prevents it from sending HVCS payments the priority is to resolve the issue and resume normal operations. If the Disabling Event is not resolved by 15:00 then minimising the delay to payments becomes the priority and AusPayNet, in consultation with the RBA and the Affected Member, could declare a Participant Fallback Period. A Participant Fallback Period could be declared earlier than 15:00 if the Affected Participant has urgent payments to send and cannot estimate their recovery time; or is able to rule out a recovery ahead of the checkpoint times. Decisions concerning a Participant Fallback Period will be communicated to RITS operational contacts via email and SMS. If the Affected Participant’s Disabling Event occurs after 14:00, AusPayNet in consultation with the RBA, would normally expect that a Participant Fallback Period would not be required, but would consider the value of outstanding payments in its assessment.

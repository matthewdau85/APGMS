Any certified Issuer, which proposes to: implement any new SCM (not currently covered by an existing Letter of Approval); continue to employ an SCM which has reached or is about to reach its ‘Letter of Approval’ sunset date, unless the Company has renewed the Device’s Approval Period; or implement any changes to an existing SCM’s cryptographic devices, PIN or cryptographic key handling and management processing; must apply for approval of the Device as required by clause 2.2 as if each Device is a new Device for the purposes of that section. 2.4 Cryptographic standards Issuers must ensure that all cryptographic operations associated with the processing of Transactions and PIN management satisfy the cryptographic standards set out in IAC Code Set Volume 4 (Device Requirements and Cryptographic Management). 4 Last amended 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 5 Amended effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 2 ISSUER PIN MANAGEMENT AND SECURITY Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 7 2.5 PIN generation Random, including customer-selected, PIN is the preferred option for PIN generation. Where a derived PIN is produced, the PIN derivation technique must be based on a cryptographic algorithm which employs a minimum key size of 128- bits. 2.6 PIN change PIN change and PIN distribution over any form of open network (e.g., Internet, mobile phone) and not using SCDs, must conform to the minimum requirements specified in Part 3 clause 3.1 of this Volume 2, and have regard to the principles and best practice recommendations described in Part 3 of this Volume 2.6 2.7 Offline PIN If offline PIN verification is supported, Australian IC Cards that can be used to initiate a Transaction must be capable of Dynamic Data Authentication (DDA) or Combined Data Authentication (CDA). Protection of an offline PIN, during transmission to the IC Card must employ an asymmetric cipher mechanism compliant with part 7 of EMV 4.3 Specifications, Book 2 - Security and Key Management. The use of a separate PIN encryption key pair is highly recommended (available from www.emvco.org). 2.8 PIN block formats Where a message contains PIN data, that PIN data must be formatted in accordance with one of the PIN block formats specified in ISO 9564.1, with the exception of formats 1 and 2.7 2.9 PIN entry attempts The number of PIN entry attempts allowed by an Issuer to a Cardholder prior to disabling Card access is at the Issuer’s discretion. However, it is recommended that the minimum number of PIN entry attempts (whether consecutive per an individual Transaction or cumulative over a given period of time – generally 24 hours) should be set at 3. 2.10 Transaction Verification8 Issuers must ensure that for all Cards issued from 1 January 2026 all values for the variants of Card Security Codes are unique and unpredictable. This includes: the CVV2 (or equivalent CSC) printed on the card itself, 6 Last amended effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 7 Last amended effective 21/11/16, version 004 r&p 002.16 8 Inserted effective 1/7/20, version 011 r&p 001.20 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 2 ISSUER PIN MANAGEMENT AND SECURITY Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 8 the CVC1 (or equivalent CSC) encoded in the magnetic stripe discretionary data, and the iCCV (or equivalent CSC) encoded in the EMV Track Two Equivalent Data. The CVC1 and iCVV (or equivalent CSC) must be verified as correct for all transactions from 1 January 2026.

This includes, but is not limited to, PIN change and delivery mechanisms, internet banking registration systems, and other internet product offerings by an Issuer.

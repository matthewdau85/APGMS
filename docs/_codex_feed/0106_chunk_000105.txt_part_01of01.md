also create new challenges for some users. For this reason, AusPayNet developed the Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals in 2019. These guidelines were the first in the world to address access to POS touchscreen technology for people living with vision and/or motor impairments. In 2023, an independent review conducted by the consultancy firm Intopia concluded that the Accessibility Guidelines remain fit-for-purpose. To further enhance accessibility and inclusion in payments, AusPayNet is planning to undertake work on expanding the Guidelines to include a broader range of payment products and services (including mobile payments), as well as a broader spectrum of disabilities. We look forward to collaborating with Members and key stakeholders on this important topic over the coming year. Blog posts AusPayNet regularly publishes blog posts, sharing important information and insights regarding Australia’s payments system. In case you missed them, our most recent posts are: Private-Public Collaboration and a Toolbox Approach to Preventing Economic Crime : In this blog, AusPayNet’s Head of Economic Crime, Toby Evans, highlights the growing threat of economic crime and the importance of adopting a ‘toolbox’ approach in response to that threat. Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) : LEI codes – and the data captured within them – allow the legal entities participating in a financial transaction to be clearly and uniquely identified. In this blog, AusPayNet Business Analyst David O'Mahony reflects on the catalyst for the introduction of LEIs and considers the potential benefits of expanding their use across the economy. top Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) migration program update In July, work commenced on the first six months of the Initiation and Mobilisation phase of this project. This phase is focused on the technical blueprint and options to approach the migration. Technical blueprint In August, the first Standards and Requirements Working Group (SRWG) meeting was held, and a draft set of standards for the AES Technical Blueprint representing the industry target state for migrating Australian card payment system to AES. Following this meeting, further SRWG meetings were held to develop a draft Technical Blueprint Handbook which underpins the set of standards for the AES Technical Blueprint. This handbook will enable Members to plan their respective projects in support of the AES Migration Program. AusPayNet anticipates the final release of the handbook will occur in April 2024. Migration options AusPayNet continues work to establish a set of viable options for approaching the migration to AES, including co-existence of AES with the current encryption standard for the Australian card payments system, TDES (Triple Data Encryption Standard). In February 2024, a Migration Planning Working Group (MPWG) will be established with Member representation across the Australian card payments system. The goal of the MPWG is to define a strategy, approach, and plan to migrate to AES. The first objective of the MPWG will be to define an interim release of AES Migration Strategy by June 2024. This strategy will provide support for Members to define their projects to migrate to AES. top AusPayNet’s program to become an authorised standards-setting body (ASSB) Over the past six months, we have been consulting with our Members and stakeholders on the framework, governance model and operating models being developed for AusPayNet to become an ASSB for the payments industry. This development and ongoing consultation continue and will be informed by the Treasury’s second consultation on the new payments service provider (PSP) licensing framework, expected to be released by the end of this year. In parallel, AusPayNet has been developing a pipeline of potential standards that may be set by AusPayNet as an ASSB and the standards development processes and controls to support this. A shortlist of 18 topics has now been identified for a formal consultation, comprising of topics covered by existing frameworks or code sets that require wider applicability or greater enforcement (‘refresh and set’), and topics outside existing frameworks that may require technical standards for the Australian payments system (‘develop and set’). This latter category will include any specific requests by government or regulators for AusPayNet to develop technical standards that support defined policy initiatives (for example, in areas such as tokenisation or advanced encryption). AusPayNet is expecting to release the Standards Pipeline and Process Consultation in Q1 2024, subject to calibration of timing with Treasury’s second consultation on the PSP licensing framework. top eConveyancing Code update This year marked an important milestone for AusPayNet and e-Conveyancing. In late 2021, following a request from Government and Members, we established a steering committee and two working groups comprising Electronic Lodgement Network Operators (ELNOs) and other subject matter experts to develop an Industry Code for eConveyancing payments. Development was halted at industry’s request during much of 2022; however, once resumed, a year of consultation with key participants in the eConveyancing industry, drafting and review, culminated in the eConveyancing Payments Industry Code (eC1) being approved by the AusPayNet Board on 31 August. The Code marks the creation of the first Framework at AusPayNet for nearly a decade and provides regulations and operating procedures to ensure that all parties involved in eConveyancing financial transactions have a common set of rules and mutually understood obligations. This will be especially important as eConveyancing evolves to an interoperable model, with ELNOs sharing information related to the financial legs of a property settlement. Now that the Code has been approved, we can move to the implementation stage of the project. In consultation with the e-conveyancing industry, in the coming

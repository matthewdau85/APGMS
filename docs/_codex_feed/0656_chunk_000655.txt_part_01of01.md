It must comply, at a minimum, with the standards detailed in the ePayments Code published by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). In addition to these requirements, any Card number included on the Record of Transaction must have at least four (4) digits excluded. The preferred method of truncation is to print the first six (6) digits and the last (3) digits of the Card number on the Record of Transaction. Card expiry dates should be excluded from Cardholder’s Record of Transaction. For ATM Transactions, the Acquirer must be clearly identified on the Record of Transaction. (Note: IAC Code Set Volume 6 (ATM System Code) contains additional requirements concerning a Record of Transaction for Transactions which involve an ATM Operator Fee). 2.2 PIN Security Acquirers must ensure that: only Approved Devices are employed in Interchange;8 5 Last amended effective 1/1/19, version 008 r&p 002.18 6 Last amended effective 1/1/19, version 008 r&p 002.18 7 Last amended effective 1/1/19, version 008 r&p 002.18 8 Last amended effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE PART 2 – TRANSACTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 6 the management of the Approved Devices meets the applicable management standards (see Part 3); 9 the key management practices employed comply with current AS 2805.6 series requirements; PIN management procedures and practices comply with current AS 2805.3.1 requirements; where a Transaction contains PIN data (bit 52), that PIN data must be formatted in accordance with one of the PIN block formats specified in ISO 9564.1 with the exception of formats 1and 2; and10 All deployed ATM payment applications are either listed on the Approved Devices List prior to December 2021 or have been reviewed by the Acquirer or a trusted third party on behalf of the Acquirer and have been shown to contain no security vulnerabilities or other security weaknesses;11 as further detailed below. 2.3 Approvals12 2.3.1 Approved Devices13 All Devices, Solutions and Non-Standard Technology involved in the production, distribution, selection, entering and transmission of plaintext Cardholder PINs, or cryptographic keys used to protect Cardholder PINs, Cardholder Data or Transactions, in the Interchange environment must meet the requirements set out in Part 3 and must be approved for use by the Company as specified in the IAC Code Set Volume 4 (Device Requirements and Cryptographic Management).14 Only Approved Devices may be attached to the Interchange networks. Any Issuer or Acquirer, which proposes to:15 (i) implement any new Device, Solution or Non-Standard Technology (not currently covered by an existing Letter of Approval or other notification of approval described in the Device Approval Process); or (ii) continue to employ an Approved Device which has reached or is about to reach its ‘Letter of Approval’ sunset date, unless the Company has renewed the device’s Approval Period; or 9 Last amended effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 10 Amended effective 21/11/16, version 004 r&p 002.16 11 Amended effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 12 Amended effective 1/1/19, version 008 r&p 002.18 13 Amended effective 1/1/19, version 008 r&p 002.18 14 Last amended effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 15 Amended effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE PART 2 – TRANSACTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 7 (iii) implement any changes to an existing Approved Device’s cryptographic devices, PIN or cryptographic key handling and management processing, must apply for approval of the Device, Solution or Non-Standard Technology as required by clause 2.3.1(a) as if each is a new Device, Solution or Non-Standard Technology for the purposes of that clause. 2.3.2 Software-based PIN entry on COTS (SPoC) Solutions [Deleted]16 2.3.3 Contactless Payments on COTS (CPoC) Solutions [Deleted]17 2.3.4 Non-Standard POI Technology [Deleted]18 2.4 Cryptographic standards 2.4.1 General Acquirers must ensure that all cryptographic operations associated with the processing of Transactions satisfy current IAC cryptographic standards (see IAC Code Set Volume 4 (Device Requirements and Cryptographic Management). These include requirements regarding: 19 (i) PIN encryption and Message Authentication across IAC Interchange Links;20 (ii) Message encryption across IAC Interchange Lines;21 (iii) PIN encryption and Message Authentication from Terminals and across Acquirer links; and (iv) Key management practices. 2.4.2 Message Authentication (for IAC Interchange Links)22 Message Authentication must apply to all IAC Interchange Links. The Message Authentication Code (MAC) must be calculated using, as a minimum, a DEA 3 (128-bit) key, Triple-DES and an algorithm conforming to AS 2805.4.1. All interchange

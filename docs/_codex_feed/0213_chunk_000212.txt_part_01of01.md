In June 2024, we responded to ASX’s whitepaper on Considerations for accelerating cash equities settlement in Australia to T+1 . As noted in the ASX whitepaper, transitioning to a shorter settlement cycle for cash equities in Australia requires careful consideration of a wide range of risks, benefits and costs. We reiterated our commitment to supporting the ongoing communications between ASX and CHESS payment providers – including through our Equity Settlement Payment Provider Sub-Committee forum – and noted that we looked forward to working with ASX to support any changes to the settlement cycle. AusPayNet’s submission is available below.

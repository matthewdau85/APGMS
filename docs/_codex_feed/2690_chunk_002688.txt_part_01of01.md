(e.g., a merchant) receives account data via a single or limited number of telephone lines. Payment processing in simple telephone environments often occurs using payment channels such as a dial-up payment terminal or a virtual terminal. Entities processing telephone payments in this way should consider how customer account data is secured. Scenario 1 – Traditional telephone line Generally speaking, entities are not considered responsible for the transmission of card data over an external traditional telephone line (also described as “plain old telephone service,” or POTS), as the risk of man-in-the middle attacks on data transmissions over these lines is considered low. Diagram 1 below shows a simple telephone environment where account data is spoken over a traditional POTS telephone line.

However, should the entity use an answering machine to capture customer account data or the person answering the call writes down the account data, then the collection of account data in the scenario would be considered “storage,” and the entity’s processes and environment would be considered in scope for PCI DSS. If the payment terminal illustrated in Diagram 1 connects to the Acquirer/PSP via Internet Protocol (IP), this connection may also be considered in the scope of PCI DSS. See Appendix F, Section F.3, “Simple Telephone System – Further Examples,” for more information. Scenario 2 – Call transferred to a call center service provider Diagram 2 below shows another example of simple telephone environment, this one using a call center service provider. In this example, the entity does not collect any payment or account data, but transfers the call to a call center service provider to handle the payment.

If the entity has the ability to record account data, the account data will need to be protected in accordance with applicable PCI DSS requirements. Diagram 2: Simple telephone environment with call center service provider Where account data is received by the entity via POTS then transmitted over an IP-based or public network to an acquirer or PSP or manually entered or stored on an entity’s system, PCI DSS requirements for the protection of customer account data would also apply. Where VoIP is used for transmissions of payment card account data between a cardholder and an entity, the entity’s systems and networks used for those transmissions are in scope. Securing the VoIP transmission outside of the entity’s infrastructure is not considered within the entity’s scope, as the entity cannot control the methods used by the cardholder to make and receive phone calls. This applies regardless of whether the transmissions are initiated by the entity or the cardholder.

Often this type of environment is a customer service center or call center. The use cases illustrated in Diagrams 3, 4, and 5 offer general examples of how PCI DSS scope applies to complex telephone environments. 2.3.2.1 Environment with no payment card data Diagram 3 represents a telephone environment where no CHD is collected (i.e., no card data is given to the entity by the customer using a telephone) or before the CHD is provided. In this scenario, no component or system is in scope for the entity’s PCI DSS.

Table 3 – Call flow prior to CHD being present Step 1: The customer makes a call to the entity. Step 2: The call traverses the carrier network, the telephone switch answers and directs the call to an available agent. Step 3: The entity’s voice and data network transmit the call to the agent. Step 4: The agent answers the call and interacts with the customer. Step 5: The agent enters data into the customer database. Step 6: The event is reported. Step 7: The call is recorded, and the recording is stored.

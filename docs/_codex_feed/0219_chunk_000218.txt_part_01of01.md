In January 2025, we responded to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee’s inquiry into the provisions of the S cams Prevention Framework (SPF) Bill 2024 . Our submission built on our feedback in response to Treasury’s consultations on mandatory industry scam codes in January 2024, and the SPF exposure draft legislation in October 2024. In this submission, we noted that while some of our recommendations in our earlier submissions had been adopted following the consultation on the SPF exposure draft, many of our Members’ concerns had not been sufficiently addressed in the current Bill. We recognised that further detail on some of the obligations under the SPF would be provided in the SPF rules and sectoral codes. We shared that we looked forward to the industry consultations on the rules and codes, and that we would encourage the inclusion of sufficient detail in these instruments to alleviate some of the concerns highlighted in our submission. AusPayNet’s submission is available below.

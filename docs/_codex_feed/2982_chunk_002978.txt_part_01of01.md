additional challenges. For example, compromised VM instances may be deactivated before anyone is aware that a breach occurred. It may be nearly impossible to properly investigate a breach when the source of the breach is no longer in use or even in existence. 6.4.3 Breach Notification Customers should contractually require data breach notification from their Providers in clear and unambiguous language, taking into consideration the need to comply with local and global regulatory/breach laws, data privacy, security incident management and breach notification requirements. 17 Cloud Security Alliance, Security Guidance for Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud Computing V4.0 (Cloud Security Alliance, 2017). https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/download/security-guidance-v4. 18 Cloud Security Alliance, Mapping the Forensic Standard ISO/IEC 27037 to Cloud Computing (Cloud Security Alliance, June 2013). https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/imf/Mapping-the-Forensic-Standard-ISO-IEC-27037-to- Cloud-Computing.pdf.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 39 Categories of data and security incidents should be prioritized with expected timelines for notification depending on incident type and requirements by the Customer, and where required, should include: ▪ Defined breach notification response responsibilities and obligations ▪ Customers' contact information (e.g., email in lower priority incidents, or 24/7 incident response call number for high priority incidents) ▪ Rights to involve Customer’s or card brand forensic teams in the investigation of an incident or breach Similarly, Providers may want to contractually require their Customers to inform them of any suspected or actual compromisefor example, breach of authentication credentials or identified service vulnerabilities. When an incident notification is received by the Provider or Customer, it is that party's responsibility to follow the implemented incident response plan (per PCI DSS Requirement 12.10). In addition, Providers are required to perform reviews at least quarterly to confirm that personnel are following established processes to respond to security alerts (PCI DSS Requirement 12.11). 6.5 Vulnerability Management Proactive testing, identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities are an important part of achieving and maintaining compliance with PCI DSS for environments that utilize cloud services and systems. Within the PCI DSS are six distinct areas of vulnerability management: web application vulnerability testing (PCI DSS Requirement 6.6), internal network vulnerability scanning (PCI DSS Requirement 11.2.1), external network vulnerability scanning (PCI DSS Requirement 11.2.2), external penetration testing (PCI DSS Requirement 11.3.1), internal penetration testing (PCI DSS Requirement 11.3.2) and segmentation testing (PCI DSS Requirement 11.3.4). Scoping is a critical element of vulnerability management. Customers need to ensure that they have properly identified all in-scope systems and services, including those provided by the Provider, those for which the Customer and Provider have shared responsibility and those that fall uniquely to the Customer (e.g., on- premises, private cloud, hybrid systems, or applications or systems that the Customer maintains). Penetration testing is used to confirm segmentation controls intended to constrain scope, and to proactively identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited to allow an attacker to breach these boundaries. Testing vulnerabilities in the cloud also requires an in-depth understanding of the cloud deployment model to determine responsibility when it comes to performing the appropriate testing exercise. It is critical to understand the aspects of the environment that will be tested by the Provider and those that will be required to be tested by the Customer. It is not sufficient to identify responsibility by physical system, as each entity may have distinct or shared responsibility for aspects of a physical system (e.g., physical hardware, hypervisor, guest OS, application, configuration). These responsibilities will vary depending on cloud service delivery model (i.e., IaaS, SaaS, PaaS) or other division of control. Where shared responsibility exists for vulnerability testing activities, the Customer and Provider should cooperate to ensure that these tests are performed and vulnerabilities are resolved. It is ultimately the Customer’s responsibility to provide evidence that all required tests have been performed. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 40 The PCI Security Standards Council has published the Information Supplement Penetration Testing Guidance, which is intended to provide further understanding of penetration testing requirements, methodologies and principles as applicable to the PCI DSS environment.19 6.5.1 Web Application Vulnerability Testing All public-facing web applications must be protected, either by deploying an automated technical solution that detects and prevents web-based attacks or by employing application vulnerability security testing in accordance with PCI DSS Requirement 6.6. If a Provider is providing a web application (e.g., a SaaS application) that stores, processes, transmits or affects the security of cardholder data, the application should be either protected by a web application Firewall (or similar solution) or tested by the Provider, and this should be reflected on the Provider’s AOC and responsibility matrix. Providers that expose APIs to their Customers should also perform testing and reporting on those APIs. For applications that are supplied by the Customer (e.g., a microservice running on a PaaS or IaaS service), it is the Customer’s responsibility to perform the web application vulnerability security testing as a part of its PCI compliance program. Providers should recognize this requirement and support these required testing activities (e.g., by supporting the ability to disable controls that would impede controlled testing, by supporting applications that may perform these operations or offering a service to perform these services). 6.5.2 Network Vulnerability Scanning The Customer is

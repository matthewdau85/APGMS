time available to Participants for clearing payments using the HVCS Fallback Solution (Step 4) may be reduced. 4) If a Disabling Event occurs after 15:00, the assumption is that a HVCS Fallback Period would not normally be required; however the RBA would assess the conditions and potential systemic impact on the day of the event. 5) In all cases, a decision to declare a HVCS Fallback Period will not be taken within one hour of a Disabling Event occurring in order to allow for sufficient investigation by the RBA. Participants should begin preparing for a potential HVCS Fallback Period when a Disabling Event occurs, but will be given a minimum of 30 minutes from when the HVCS Fallback Period is declared to the implementation of the HVCS Fallback Solution. Step / Checkpoint Time Description Who Before RITS Disabling Event occurs and incident coordination begins. Before 15:00 A Disabling Event prevents RITS from effecting settlement in the normal way. An incident is raised and managed in accordance with the AusPayNet Member Incident Plan and if applicable, the Crisis Communication Plan. The RBA works to resolve the issue and recover RITS. Participants are aware of the potential for a HVCS Fallback Period and begin to prepare. RBA, AusPayNet and Participants HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 135 Decision taken to invoke HVCS Fallback Period. By 16:00 The RBA determines RITS cannot be recovered in time to complete settlement and AusPayNet declare a HVCS Fallback Period. RBA and AusPayNet Checkpoint HVCS Fallback decision point. 16:00 Decision to declare HVCS Fallback Period to be made by this time. Step 1 SWIFT instructed to change FIN-Copy Service mode. 15 min A Business Officer instructs SWIFT via the SWIFT Secure Channel. The Business Officer will request that SWIFT close the service and effect the change no earlier than 30 minutes from the time that the HVCS Fallback Period was declared to Participants. AusPayNet or RBA Step 2 SWIFT undertake FIN-Copy Service mode change. 45 min SWIFT enact the service mode change. SWIFT require a maximum of 45 minutes to do this (i.e. from the point of being instructed to the point that the service reopens in T-Copy mode). SWIFT Checkpoint T-Copy start time. 17:00 PDS to be operating in T-Copy mode by this time. Step 3 RBA confirms change of mode to Participants. 5 min The RBA notify Participants upon receiving confirmation from SWIFT that the mode has changed. RBA Step 4 Clearing continues in T-Copy. 2 hrs Participants exchange HVCS payments. This could include clearing up to a full day’s volume of payments, including any additional steps Participants must perform when operating in T-Copy. The RBA will notify Participants of the approaching T-Copy Cut-off Time 30 minutes before the Cut-off Time. Participants Checkpoint T-Copy Cut-off time. 19:00 No further T-Copy clearing to occur after this time. Step 5 SWIFT instructed to change FIN-Copy Service mode. 5 min A Business Officer instructs SWIFT via the SWIFT Secure Channel to change the FIN-Copy Service from T-Copy to Y-Copy mode. AusPayNet or RBA Step 6 Participants compile and submit provisional HVCS Exchange Summary Forms to RBA. 2 hrs Participants record the net bilateral obligations arising from the payments exchanged in Step 4 in the HVCS Exchange Summary Form. Each Participant sends one HVCS Exchange Summary Form to the RBA. The RBA confirms receipt of these via encrypted email. Resolution of discrepancies and failures to match is performed in Step 8. Participants HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 136 Step 7 RBA produces and sends Provisional HVCS Exchange Figures Advice to Participants. 1 hr The RBA generate a Provisional HVCS Exchange Figures Advice for each Participant based on the HVCS Exchange Summary Forms submitted in Step 6. Any mismatching net bilateral positions between Participants will be displayed in this advice. The advices will be sent to Participants via encrypted email. Participants have until the commencement of the Morning Settlement Session the next day to reconcile any discrepancies with other Participants and submit a revised version of their HVCS Exchange Summary Form to the RBA (see Step 12). RBA Step 8 Overrun buffer. 2 hrs Buffer if Steps 1 to 7 overrun. Participants can use this time to resolve mismatching net bilateral positions advised by the RBA in Step 7. - Checkpoint Midnight. 00:00 Hard cut-off time. Step 7 must be complete by this time. Step 9 RITS recovery continues. 6.5 hrs Where necessary, the RBA continue work to recover RITS ready for the overnight processing required before the next day. RBA Step 10 RITS reports and overnight processing occurs. RBA proceed with normal report production and overnight processing required to prepare RITS for the next day. Step 11 RITS connection to SWIFT Feeder restored. Once RITS is recovered and the system date has rolled forward, the SWIFT Feeder connection is restored. The backlog of settlement requests held in the CSI from T-Copy clearing the previous day will enter RITS and be rejected due to the back-dated value date. Senders can use the RITS UI to view the record of rejected T-Copy settlement requests (see Step 12). Checkpoint RITS available. 06:30 RITS to be available by this time to prepare contingency batch. Step 12

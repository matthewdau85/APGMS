All other information must be kept well away from the amount in figures. Information must not appear to the right of the amount in figures. The document design must also enable the name of the Financial Institution on which the cheque is drawn to be determined at a glance. The Financial Institution name must be in the upper portion of the form. The design should also be such that the signature of the drawer and the printed name of the account can be readily located. The printed name of the account should be adjacent to the signature. The area reserved for signature(s) must be free of other printing which could interfere with legibility and placed to keep signatures from encroaching into areas reserved for the amount in figures and magnetic ink encoding. Draft layout of forms must be submitted to the Financial Institution concerned for design approval before proceeding with expensive artwork, see Section 1.3. Financial Institutions will not accept a design unless the principles outlined in these specifications are observed. It should be noted that production of documents must not commence until approval from the Financial Institution is obtained, ie a Design Approval Number (DAN) and Printing Approval Number (PAN) have been allocated and a Confirmatory Authority issued. MICR encoding of documents must conform to prescribed standards detailed in AusPayNet Publication "Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Technical Specifications". It is essential that paper used for printing of forms be of the required standard, reference must be made to the AusPayNet Publication Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Technical Specifications, Section 6 – Paper for MICR Encoded Documents. The following matters must be addressed to prevent potential problems:  Carefully review the layout of any proposed document in relation to the standards contained in this publication.  Keep the clear band reserved for MICR encoding purposes free of all printing other than the protective tints.  Avoid the use of dark colours in the background of the document that could interfere with vital information.  Use appropriate colours, refer to Appendices A and B.  Documents must not contain advertising messages of any kind other than a company logo.  Discuss your ideas with the relevant Financial Institution. Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 9 AusPayNet September 2017 Cheques are essentially operational documents and must be both person and machine readable, regardless of the manner in which they have been completed. The main ways used to differentiate between debits and credits are printing the word "Debit" or "Credit", the use of colour and/or distinguishing trancodes. Practical means for an Image Processing System to identify the difference is via the MICR codeline, position of the data, or the words "Debit" or "Credit" printed as scan-readable. 1.2 Legal Definitions 1.2.1 Cheques A cheque is an unconditional order in writing that: (a) is addressed by a person to another person (being a Financial Institution); (b) is signed by the person giving it; and (c) requires the Financial Institution to pay on demand a sum certain in money. An instrument that does not comply with these rules or that orders any act to be done in addition to the payment of money, is not a cheque. Financial Institution means: (a) the Reserve Bank of Australia; or (b) a bank within the meaning of the Banking Act 1959; or (c) a building society, credit union or special services provider; or (d) a person who carries on State banking within the meaning of paragraph 51(xiii) of the Constitution; or (e) a person (other than a person referred to in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d)) who carries on the business of banking outside Australia. 1.3 Procedures 1.3.1 Register of Recognised Security Printers Amended, effective 19/05/08 AusPayNet maintains a register of recognised security printers that provide a service for the printing of cheques and deposit forms. Recognised security printers are either corporate or commercial printers. Commercial printers print their own base stock while corporate printers MICR in-house or carry out printing on behalf of others using pre-printed base stock. An organisation may ask any Financial Institution to submit a written request to AusPayNet for registration as a recognised security printer or request registration direct. A recognised security printer may have one registration or may have multiple sites registered as separate organisations where they operate as independent units. A three digit Printer Identifier will be allocated by AusPayNet to each recognised security printer that applies for registration (multiple Printer Identifiers in the case of registration of multiple sites). The Printer Identifier is to be quoted by the recognised security printer when requesting design approval and/or printing approval from the customer’s or other relevant Financial Institution. The Printer Identifier is also used by the Financial Institution when allocating a Design Approval Number (DAN) and a Printing Approval Number (PAN). Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 10 AusPayNet September 2017 1.3.2 Financial Institution’s Approval Procedures for Printing Amended, effective 02/2001 Before production commences the printer must obtain DAN, PAN and a Confirmatory Authority from the customer’s or other relevant Financial Institution. Depending on the circumstances, a printer may submit a request for approval of a base design from any Financial Institution prior to submitting requests for printing approval from the customer’s Financial Institution. Alternatively, both requests may be submitted to the customer’s Financial Institution together. Once a

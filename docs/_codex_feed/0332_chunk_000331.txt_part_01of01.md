waveform and matrix read technologies. The magnetic recognition technology is also supplemented with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on some machines. More recently Imaging and Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) functions have become available. These latter functions remove much of the work carried out by proof-machine operators as the written or printed amount can be interpreted and recorded electronically instead of being entered by keyboard then MICR encoded on the document. 5.1.1 Waveform Readers The MICR line is magnetised by passing over a write head and then read by moving past a magnetic read head that generates a very small electrical signal. The normal process uses the rate of change in this signal to generate a pattern that is unique for each character or symbol, this is the typical waveform image shown in this publication. An alternative method is to use the integrated waveform where the image is quite different, with no negative peaks. The signals are captured, amplified and processed through special electronic circuitry to interpret and identify the characters. These systems can operate at very high speeds, up to 1,000 documents per minute. There is some variation between systems for the write heads but the read heads are all very similar, as they must conform to the ANSI Standards. The major differences are in the recognition methods, NCR, BancTec and some medium speed IBM machines use the integrated waveform whilst Unisys machines may use a derivative waveform method that is unique to Unisys. It should be noted that the algorithms used for interpretation of patterns and read/write head technology used for identification of MICR characters may vary from model to model within a manufacturer’s range. The waveform method uses wide heads to cover the whole MICR band and as such have the ability to read at a distance from the head’s surface. This makes these machines tolerant of debossment or embossment of characters. 5.1.2 Matrix Readers The matrix head method for MICR recognition was developed in the 1960s by Burroughs (now Unisys) and IBM. It is a more complex and expensive technology than the waveform method and has thus been used only on the higher speed machines. It has been adopted because it gives lower reject rates than waveform machines. The machines that currently use this technology are the IBM 3890 series and the Unisys DP1800 series of reader/sorters. A high frequency AC write system magnetises the characters in a manner that breaks them up into individual slices, each with their own N-S poles. The read head has 30 mini-heads oriented at right angles to the slices generated by the write head. This process provides a magnetic bit matrix showing the presence or absence of magnetic material in each matrix cell. Electronic techniques allow for movement of the matrix pattern to optimise identification of characters. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 38 AusPayNet September 2017 Because the read and write heads are very small, the MICR code line must be kept in very close contact with the matrix head for reliable reading. This makes the technology susceptible to over-debossment, where it may not read the characters. Conversely, embossed images may cause wear to the head and the MICR codeline. To overcome this, IBM uses a thin non-magnetic film between the document and the read head. This moves slowly across the head and removes any contamination, which could interfere with the reading capabilities of the machine. 5.2 Reader/Sorters A reader/sorter is a mechanical document processor for reading MICR lines, interpreting and validating code lines and separating the documents into groups. The capability has also been added to make an image of the document for storage and interpretation of the value. This “Image Capture” capability will reduce the reliance on mechanical means for sorting, exchanging and storage of physical documents, as these functions are capable of being performed electronically. 5.2.1 Low Speed Reader/ Sorters and Proof Machines A large range of lower speed reader/sorters is in use, largely for proof encoding and remittance processing purposes. These machines are usually manually loaded with the document being positioned for an operator to read the value of the document, which they then key enter. This value is then MICR encoded onto the document with a small impact ribbon printer and forward to one of a limited number of sort pockets. The proof encoding process is being replaced by Image Capture and Intelligent Character Recognition technology, whereby the document’s image is stored and the written or printed value is interpreted and stored with the image. The data in the MICR line is still captured magnetically and stored with the image data ready for further electronic processing. The main tasks of the operator are to load the machine and interpret any amounts that the software cannot read with confidence. 5.2.2 High Speed Reader/Sorters These machines are capable of processing over 1,500 six-inch documents per minute and are typically used in the processing centers of large Financial Institutions. Those in current use are the IBM 3890 series and the Unisys DP1800 series; plus the BancTec models 5500 and 5300 that are slightly slower speed machines. These machines are typified by the large number of pockets that are used for sorting and several passes are made to initially capture data and then to sort documents into the required order for exchange and storage. The large number of passes used for this processing are the reason for many

is in line with expected weekday variations, with a mid week peak and a weekend trough (Graph 2). For example, there is a peak in transactions on Wednesday and Thursday, which may be the result of consumers making more NPP payments on days they receive their salaries. Differences in consumer and business payment behaviour may also be influencing the intraday FSS settlement patterns (Graph 3). The value of FSS settlements is elevated on business days between 9 am to 5 pm, reflecting the higher values involved in business-related transactions, whereas the peak volume of payments is spread more widely through the day until around 9 pm, with evening payments presumably mostly reflecting consumers making lower-value payments. The uptick in values early in the morning represents some payments that have been instructed by customers days in advance, and scheduled by ADIs to occur at times when customers are less likely to be making high volumes of immediate payments. These patterns will likely become clearer when there is significantly more volume of payments going through the FSS as use increases and a broader range of customer channels and segments are using the NPP. RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA BULLETIN – SEPTEMBER 2018 12 Graph 2 Graph 3 RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA BULLETIN – SEPTEMBER 2018 13 Summary The NPP and FSS represent a significant development in the Australian payment system, with customers of financial institutions now having the ability to make immediate payments on a 24/7 basis with more easily remembered PayIDs. With the capacity to send detailed information along with these fast payments, the NPP has been designed to meet the needs of Australia's digital economy and has the potential to promote further innovation and competition in payments services in the years to come.

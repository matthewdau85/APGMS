SAQ D-Merchant There were no changes to SAQ D for Merchants other than the general changes made to all SAQs. Are there any new SAQs? Yes, the Self-Assessment Questionnaire for Software PIN entry on COTS (SAQ SPoC) was released in September 2023. This SAQ is for merchants using a commercial off-the-shelf mobile device (for example, phone or tablet) with a secure card reader that is part of a SPoC Solution that is on PCI SSC’s list of validated Software-based PIN Entry on COTS (SPoC) Solutions. And what about SAQ D for Service Providers? SAQ D for Service Providers is the ONLY SAQ for SAQ-eligible service providers. All other SAQs are for merchant use only. If any requirement is not applicable for a given service provider’s environment, it can be marked as “Not Applicable” in the SAQ and described in Appendix C: Explanation of Requirements Noted as Not Applicable . This SAQ includes all PCI DSS requirements, including those designated “for service providers only.” SAQ D for Service Providers for PCI DSS v4 also includes the following additional reporting requirements: New Section 2a, which specifies additional required documentation for service provider self-assessments. At each PCI DSS requirement, addition of a section for service providers to briefly “Describe Results” including how the evidence examined and testing performed supports the response selected by the service provider for a given requirement. Next steps To make sure your organization is prepared for what is new in PCI DSS v4 SAQs, perform a gap analysis to understand your PCI DSS status in relation to the new requirements. If you need help understanding whether your organization is eligible or required to complete an SAQ, and which SAQ is appropriate for your environment, contact your merchant bank (acquirer), the applicable payment brand(s), or other compliance entity.

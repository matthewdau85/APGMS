of Customer data have been maintained. Where introspection is used by a third-party Provider, the Customers may wish to consider implementing data-level security controls (such as strong cryptography with all key storage and encryption/decryption operations external to the cloud service) to avoid exposing sensitive data to the enhanced monitoring features that introspection provides. E.7 Containers Containerization is an increasingly popular technology for efficiently running many instances of a server or application. It has resource, security and security isolation properties similar to those of virtual machines, but not the memory and performance overhead inherent in system-level hypervisors. Container orchestration platforms are becoming an increasingly popular service offering that allows Customers to spin an instance or a swarm of containers, and dynamically control the computing output capacity. 24 Gary Wang, Zachary J.

This provides speed and scalability by increasing the quantity of containers in the group dynamically. Because of this, controls should focus on the image templates and group as an aggregate, not the individual containers within the group. Organizations should examine their container orchestration technology to confirm that it includes at least the following: ▪ Access controls to both the orchestration framework and the containers themselves such that different workloads do not have access to keys, identity tokens and other sensitive information used by other containers in the cluster. ▪ Process isolation of the running containers based on industry standard technologies such as kernel namespaces () and CGroups(). Best practices include controls to enforce kernel permission checks on privileged processes (sometimes referred to as capabilities). ▪ Access restriction of containers to host file systems and access restriction to container file systems by other containers. ▪ A fully functioning and container-specific system-call firewall that has a standard default deny rule and allows only known safe system calls. As an alternative, kernel security features such as AppArmor, SELinux, RSEC and Secure Computing Mode (seccomp) can be used to allow only system calls known to be safe. ▪ Strong network and administrative isolation between containers hosting different workloads based on a container-specific network interface such as the docker0 interface and Software Defined Networking (see Section E.4, “Software Defined Networking”). ▪ Where possible, kernel isolation, as offered by some hypervisor-based container solutions, to address the recommendations of the PCI DSS Virtualization Guidelines26 for mixed-mode workloads. ▪ The ability to generate an audit of access approvals and review for the container orchestration system, demonstrating that access is limited to the least number of people appropriate for the in- scope workloads. ▪ Because most container solutions leverage Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment development methodologies, the integrity of the CI/CD pipeline and change control must be evaluated to validate the strength of the above controls (see Section E12, “Change Detection for Cloud-based Systems”). ▪ The repository storing the container images must be managed securely, and creation of the images handled under strict change management. ▪ Images used for containers should be patched during the process of image creation (i.e., image template), and should undergo standard vulnerability assessment prior to committing the image to the repository. 26 Virtualization Special Interest Group and PCI Security Standards Council, PCI DSS Virtualization Guidelines (PCI SSC, June 2011), https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Virtualization_InfoSupp_v2.pdf.

As containers can be used to achieve a similar level of execution, organizations may choose to use them to segment their PCI DSS scope in a manner similar to virtual machines. The Customer must validate that the container orchestration technology or solution offered by the Provider has all the features required to fully isolate containers. If isolation of workloads within a cluster cannot be assured through technical controls, the Customer should consider deployment of workloads into separate, workload-specific clusters. Some Providers may deliver the ability for an individual Customer to orchestrate multiple clusters, but some Providers may not offer this, and all workloads are deployed into shared, mixed workload clusters. In the latter case, a Customer may need to consider workload-specific Customer accounts to provide the isolation necessary. Validating that a container solution has the necessary isolation strength in place will mean choosing a publicly vetted and trusted open source or commercial off-the-shelf solution that has demonstrated a strong security track record over time, rather than building a container technology in-house. Many organizations have struggled to address quarterly and annual PCI DSS requirements for containers that may be created, run, retired and destroyed in a matter of days or hours. In some cases, a check of the container fleet may occur every week, such as for file integrity monitoring for PCI DSS Requirement 11.5, or over the course of weeks or months in the case of a penetration test. In cases where the container life

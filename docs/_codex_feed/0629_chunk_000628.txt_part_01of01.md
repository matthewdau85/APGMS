key could be determined without knowledge of all components. Key components are combined using one of the following functions:91 Key shares are combined to form a key by a process such that no active bit of the key could be determined without knowledge of m of n key shares. Reference ISO 11568, clause 4.1.2; PCI PIN SR 12-4. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (h) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure when in secure transit, cleartext key components are protected from compromise in one of the following manners:92 Key components are transported in separate tamper-evident packaging; and/or Key components are transported in an Approved Device. Reference ISO 11568, clause 4.1.2; PCI PIN SR 12-4. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason 90 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 91 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 92 Last amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 1 - INTRODUCTION AND MEMBER OBLIGATIONS ANNEXURE A ANNUAL SECURITY AUDITS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 34 (i) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure a cleartext key component is:93 Under the supervision of a person authorised by management with access to this component; or Locked in a security container in such a way that can be obtained only by a person with authorized access; or In secure transit; or In an Approved Device. Reference ISO 11568, clause 4.10.2, Annex B; PCI PIN SR 13-5. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (j) Documented procedures exist and are followed to protect the transfer of a key, key component or key share into SCDs so as to prevent the disclosure of the key, key components or key shares. Examples of procedures include physical inspection of the SCD equipment to detect evidence of monitoring and dual custody of the loading process.94 Reference ISO 11568, clause 4.10.2, Annex B; PCI PIN SR 14. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (k) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure that a key exists at only the minimal number of locations consistent with the operation of the system (e.g., including disaster recovery purposes, dual processing sites).95 93 Last amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 94 Last amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 95 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 1 - INTRODUCTION AND MEMBER OBLIGATIONS ANNEXURE A ANNUAL SECURITY AUDITS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 35 Reference ISO 11568, clauses 4.1.6 and 4.11.2. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (l) Documented procedures exist and are followed, to prohibit, except by chance, the entry or use of the same key in more than one PIN entry device.96 Reference ISO 11568, 4.11.1; PCI PIN SR 20-1. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (m) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure a key shared between communicating parties is not shared, except by chance, between any other communicating parties.97 Reference ISO 11568, 4.11.1; PCI PIN SR 17-1. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (n) Procedures exist and are followed to ensure a key or key component that has been used for a cryptographic purpose is erased or destroyed when it is no longer required using approved destruction procedures.98 Reference ISO 11568, 4.14; PCI PIN SR 24, 31. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason 96 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 97 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 98 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 1 - INTRODUCTION AND MEMBER OBLIGATIONS ANNEXURE A ANNUAL SECURITY AUDITS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 36 (o) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure that when a key transport key (KTK) is changed because its compromise is known or suspected, an organisation which has previously shared the key is informed of the compromise even if the KTK is no longer in use.99 Reference ISO 11568, 4.17; PCI PIN SR 22-1.4. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (p) Documented procedures exist and are followed to monitor cryptographic synchronisation errors and to investigate multiple synchronisation errors to ensure the SCD is not being misused to determine keys or PINs.100 Reference PCI PIN SR 18-1. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (q) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure if two or more of a key’s components or shares are stored within the same security container (which is under dual control), then each component and share is secured in separate tamper evident packaging to preclude any component or share holder from gaining access to sufficient components or shares to reconstruct the key.101 Reference ISO 11568, 4.12.1; PCI PIN SR 21-3.1. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason 99 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 100 Amended effective 1/1/24, version 015 r&p 003.23 101 Last amended effective 1/1/25, version 016 r&p 001.24 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 1 - INTRODUCTION AND MEMBER OBLIGATIONS ANNEXURE A ANNUAL SECURITY AUDITS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 37 (r) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure a key loading device does not retain a clear-text copy of any key it has successfully transferred.102 Reference ISO 13491-2 F8; PCI PIN SR 6-4, 13-4.4. Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (s) If personal computers are used to load encryption keys into a PIN entry device, procedures exist and are followed

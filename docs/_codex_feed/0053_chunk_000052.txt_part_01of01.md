Risk Assessment has highlighted the importance of end-user engagement and AusPayNet’s Board will continue to discuss AusPayNet’s role in this to ensure that end-user perspectives are appropriately considered throughout the BECS Transition. Although AusPayNet’s primary channel remains our BECS Members who engage with their customers, the launch of the public consultation on the A2A vision will enable the widest possible range of stakeholders and users to input into the future of Australia’s A2A system. AusPayNet continues to have direct engagement with AusPayNet’s Stakeholder Advisory Council (ASAC), which has representatives from government and end-user interest groups. Pillar 5: Communicate with members and stakeholders AusPayNet is working with AP+ on the appropriate engagement approach for common members (i.e. BECS Members who are also participants of NPP) to avoid duplication in information gathering and communication. Any joint engagement will be subject to the ACCC authorisation conditions. AusPayNet continues to meet bilaterally with our members as part of our ongoing member engagement, and regularly engages with the RBA, Treasury and providers of modern alternatives to BECS. The next update on the BECS Transition Program will be published in September 2025.

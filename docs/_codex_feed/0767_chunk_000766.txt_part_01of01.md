The obligations in clause 6.7.7 only apply to a Personal Account.309 Note: The Notice of Variation of Account Details is used whenever a Credit User is to be notified via the User FI of a change in its customer’s account to be credited.310 6.8 Lodgement FI Responsibilities The Lodgement FI must ensure that:311 (a) each Credit User’s Files and Items which are exchanged conform with the DE File User Item Specifications (see Annexure C1) prior to them being exchanged;312 (b) the Credit User has a correct Trace Record for each transaction on the Credit Files lodged by the Lodgement FI; and313 (c) when Government Files are exchanged, they are not transmitted with other Files except pursuant to a bilateral agreement (see clause 6.2 for exchange times).314 Note: The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) requires that certain information must be included in electronic funds transfer instructions and that certain information must be obtained in respect of those instructions before financial institutions may initiate, pass on or take any other action to carry out the electronic funds transfer instructions. Please refer to Part 5 of the Act for details.315 Lodgement FIs processing and receiving transactions for a third party should agree with that third party as to who is to check Files received for correctness and who will create any necessary Return Files, Refusal Files and Reversal Files.316 The Lodgement FI must check that, if a TNA is required in accordance with clause 6.9, a TNA is held for the relevant Credit User's File and that the total value of such File is within the amount authorised by the TNA.317 309 Inserted effective 1/7/12, version 048 r&p 002.12 310 Inserted effective 1/7/12, version 048 r&p 002.12 311 Last amended effective 18/1/02, version 008 r&p 008.01 312 Last amended effective 27/7/07, version 035 r&p 005.07 313 Last amended effective 27/7/07, version 035 r&p 005.07 314 Last amended effective 27/7/07, version 035 r&p 005.07 315 Inserted effective 16/4/07, version 033 r&p 001.07 316 Last amended effective 4/8/00, version 021 r&p 004.00 317 Last amended effective 27/7/07, version 035 r&p 005.07 BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES PART 6: DIRECT CREDIT SYSTEM Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 62 Where the Lodgement FI is not the User FI and the Lodgement FI processes a File for a User where the total value of the File exceeds the amount authorised by the current TNA for that User, the File is processed at the risk of the Lodgement FI unless the excess is first approved by the User FI as an exception.

Each relevant TNA Issuer is to create the necessary TNA via BECS Connect (incorporating the content set out in Annexure A8) in favour of the Lodgement FI.319 For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these Procedures requires a TNA to be obtained where the Lodgement FI is also the User FI but the funding account is held with another financial institution.

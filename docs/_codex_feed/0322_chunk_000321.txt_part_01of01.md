distance between the right average edge of adjacent characters is 0.125 inch ± 0.010 inch. Figure 2 MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 15 AusPayNet September 2017 Tolerances accumulate when adjacent characters within a field are separated by a blank, that is a space of 0.250 ± 0.020 inch between the adjacent right-hand edges on either side of the blank space. Spacing tolerances within a field must not accumulate so that the boundaries of the field are infringed. Figure 3 Figure 4 An additional tolerance of ± 0.625 inch applies between fields when printing does not have to meet the requirements for adjacent character spacing. This applies only when fields are separated by a minimum of one blank space. 2.1.4 Alignment Alignment is the relative vertical location of characters within a given field. The alignment is measured relative to the horizontal centre line of each character. Within a given field, the bottom edges of adjacent characters must not vary by more than 0.030 inch. For the Dash and the Domestic symbols, these measurements apply to the centre-line. These tolerances shall not accumulate so that the characters impinge on the limits of the 0.250 inch MICR band commencing 3/16 inch from the bottom reference edge of the document. Figure 5 MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 16 AusPayNet September 2017 2.1.5 Skew Skew is the angular deviation of the vertical centre line of a character from a perpendicular line relative to the bottom reference edge of a document. The maximum skew allowed for any character or field is ± 1.5 0. Figure 6 2.2 Print Specifications 2.2.1 Average Edge The edge of a printed figure is typically not a straight line. An imaginary line that runs parallel to the vertical or horizontal centre lines, equally dividing the printed and unprinted areas represents the “average” edge of the character. The average edge of radii is measured tangentially to the average edge of the stroke. Figure 7 MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 17 AusPayNet September 2017 2.2.2 Average Edge Tolerance The tolerance on the average edge of a stroke is ± 0.0015 inch on the nominal edge. This, however, must not override the requirement for horizontal bars to have a minimum thickness of 0.011 inch. Figure 8 MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 18 AusPayNet September 2017 2.2.3 Edge Irregularity Peaks and valleys about the nominal edge are permitted to extend ± 0.0035 inch from that edge. The total of the edge that lies in the range 0.0015 to 0.0035 inch from the nominal edge must not exceed 25% of the total length of the edge. Deviations from the nominal edge that exceed the tolerance are regarded as voids (no print) or extraneous ink (print). No two voids shall occur within 0.0035 inch of each other when measured at the maximum point of deviation from the nominal edge. Voids that exceed the 0.0035 inch limit should be treated as such and are covered by section 2.2.4. Extraneous ink connected to the character is permitted if it can be contained within a 0.003 inch square. If they cannot be contained in this manner but can be contained within a 0.004 inch square, they are permitted if they do not total more than one per character and 5 per field. Figure 9 2.2.4 Voids Voids are the absence of print within the defined printed area of a character. The maximum allowable single void anywhere in the character, inclusive of edges, must be of a size that can be contained within a 0.008 inch square. Exceptions to this requirement are allowed if the void extends to two or more grid spaces, such as through a lower vertical section of the numeral 8, when the maximum allowable single void must be completely surrounded by ink and contained entirely within the boundary of a 0.010 inch square. Such cases do not include edge MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 19 AusPayNet September 2017 voids that are thus limited to a 0.008 inch square. Opposing edge voids that cause a complete break in a character bar are not permitted. Needle voids are long, narrow unprinted areas. They are permitted in any length provided that their maximum width does not exceed 0.002 inch. This dimension is slightly narrower than the channel between adjacent squares on the tolerance grid. The maximum allowable area of all voids shall not exceed 20% of that column or row on the grid. Figure 10 2.2.5 Uniformity of Ink or Toner Distribution The print should be uniformly distributed within the boundaries of all characters. Uneven deposits, caused by squeeze out, haloing and the like should be avoided. These defects are most common with letterpress and impact ribbon printing. Non-impact (toner) printing can also generate a non-uniform print and the shape of characters may be altered from the ideal to account for such changes. The manufacturer’s aim is to make each character or symbol to conform to the ideal waveform, when tested on a waveform measurement system or similar test instrument. Further modification may take place as a result of reader/sorter testing. 2.2.6 Extraneous Ink or Toner Extraneous ink or toner can be any ink or toner that appears in the clear bands other than the MICR characters. If magnetic, the clear band is the MICR 5/8 inch

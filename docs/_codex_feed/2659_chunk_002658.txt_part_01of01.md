of individuals, systems, sites, and privileges that large or complex organizations have to manage, using a centralized access control system is highly recommended. However, substantial thought and planning should go into designing and maintaining the architecture, processes, and components of the access-control system. One way to simplify the architecture of a centralized access control system is to separate the access-control system for the CDE from the rest of the company network (for example, into its own “domain”).

Ensuring vulnerability scans are performed, remediation efforts are conducted, and rescans to validate updates are successful can be a significant challenge within large network architectures. Additional issues may include:  Identifying all systems in scope for internal and external vulnerability scanning  Keeping the inventory and scan target list updated and current  Tracking all identified vulnerabilities and managing their remediation  Identifying and managing false positives  Managing scans within dynamic cloud environments To address these issues, a strong asset-management process is necessary. Automated asset-management systems may be required to detect when systems come online or are taken offline. The existence of a large number of IT assets within the CDE does not alter the need to perform vulnerability scans on these assets, even in highly dynamic environments. Having a process that fails to present a full and accurate picture of the entire set of CDE assets should be avoided because it may present a false level assurance that vulnerabilities are being mitigated. It is recommended that organizations implement solutions that can integrate with asset-management systems to quickly identify when assets come online, determine the previous scan and vulnerability status of those assets, and perform a vulnerability scan on the assets if they have not been previously scanned within the scan period. ASV solutions should also be able to track historical remediation efforts and provide a way to manage false positives. For environments that use automated deployments of identical systems that scale up or down based on load, or similar situations where hosts may be transient or intermittently accessible between scan periods, it may be possible to scan only the base image or a smaller set of deployed systems once the assessment validates that the transient systems are clones. However, scan sampling as a general concept is not supported by PCI DSS, regardless of system homogeneity or scale. Even very large environments need full sets of scans. Performance- or time-related issues can be resolved by using more scanning devices, each targeting a smaller segment of the population of systems in use. Clear and detailed documentation or records of all vulnerability-assessment activities should be maintained. This includes maintaining clear records of the scans themselves, since individual scan results files may not clearly identify which assets in the CDE were included in the scan. Automated solutions that integrate asset management with vulnerability management are helpful in this scenario. The key to a good vulnerability- management process is being able to track all vulnerabilities and remediation activities associated with each asset throughout that asset’s entire life cycle, even when the asset may be offline. 9.5 Patch Management Exploited vulnerabilities in hardware or software are often how breaches or data compromises originate. Most of these events could have been avoided had the breached entity applied an already-available security patch to fix the vulnerability. Yet, managing security updates and patches across a large population of IT assets can be a challenging task. Large organization need to determine:  Where current information on all security patches or updates needed for the in-scope systems is held  How the status and application of security patches across the entire organization and all of its in-scope assets are tracked and managed Information Supplement • PCI DSS for Large Organizations • February 2020 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard or constitute legal advice. 26  How it is determined whether security patches have been applied across all applicable assets and within stated PCI DSS timelines  How to manage in-scope assets that have reached end-of-life (EOL) or no longer have security patches Well-designed asset-management tools or processes are critical to addressing these questions. Asset- management tools and processes must be able to identify and track all in-scope assets, including all hardware and software that make up each asset. Asset-management tools and processes must also be able to quickly identify when patches are made available to address vulnerabilities within that hardware and software. If such capabilities are provided through manual reviews or other manual methods, it is critical that these methods be performed as frequently as possible, so that the acquisition and application of security patches occur as quickly as possible to minimize the amount of time that unpatched vulnerabilities exist on systems. If EOL for in-scope assets is concerned, the EOL event should be planned for and managed well in advance of any defined deadlines. This includes making sure the entity is aware of any upcoming EOL events well in advance. Plan to begin replacing assets

Australian Payments Plus (AP+) is rolling out a technical update to some debit cards on mobile wallets to ensure consumers can continue to make payments via eftpos from 1 Jan 2025. A small minority of consumers will need to remove and re-add their debit card to their mobile wallet. ​The update only applies specifically to consumers who: ​added the debit card to their mobile wallet before July 2023, and ​have turned on the option to send transactions via eftpos, or ​use an eftpos-only debit card. ​The update will ensure eftpos debit transactions made using these consumers’ mobile wallets will operate as normal from 1 January 2025. For those using a physical debit card, no update is required. ​AP+ has been working to make the required updates automatically. Based on the program of work underway, AP+ expects that, of the total 19.1 million eftpos cards on mobile wallets, approximately 60,000 active cards 1 will not be updated automatically. Consumers can apply the update to these cards themselves by simply removing and re-adding their card. ​AP+ is working with card issuers who will contact their potentially impacted customers directly. Consumers should be aware that no contact will be made to them directly from eftpos or AP+. If consumers have doubts about any messages received, AP+ encourages them to verify directly with their bank before taking any action. If anyone has any issues transacting via eftpos in a mobile wallet from 1 January, AP+ recommends they remove and re-add their card. ​Lynn Kraus, CEO of AP+ said ‘Even though this could impact only a minority of consumers with eftpos debit cards in their mobile wallet, we are acting now out of an abundance of caution as it is an extremely busy time of year for payments, and for those who won't be able to complete a payment, it will matter. On behalf of AP+ I apologise to anyone who might be impacted by this.’ For further enquiries please contact [email protected] .

Welcome to our podcast series, Coffee with the Council . I'm Alicia Malone, Senior Manager of Public Relations for the PCI Security Standards Council. Recently, PCI SSC published a new information supplement called PCI DSS Scoping and Segmentation Guidance for Modern Network Architectures . This document was produced by the 2023 Special Interest Group, also called a SIG, who spent a year collaborating on this project, which was led by the Council's own Kandyce Young, Manager of Data Security Standards. I am joined by Kandyce today to help walk us through what made this particular Special Interest Group and topic so special. It's great to have you here, Kandyce. Kandyce Young: I'm so very glad to be here, Alicia, and to talk about an industry-driven project that is very, very near and dear to my heart. I mean, it's special, not just because I had the privilege of chairing a group of some of the brightest minds from the most innovative organizations in the world of payment security, but also because this is a topic that many in the industry have been asking about since PCI DSS v4.0 was released in March 2022. Questions like, how can I apply PCI DSS networking controls in a zero-trust environment? Or, if my environment is both on premises and in the cloud, how can I adjust segmentation controls? And what about micro segmentation? Guidance is provided to address all of these questions in this document. Alicia Malone: That is awesome. So, let's start from the beginning. For those who may not be familiar with Special Interest Groups, let's start by explaining the process. What exactly is the purpose of a Special Interest Group and how did this topic get selected? Kandyce Young: So special interest groups, or SIGs, are community-driven initiatives that play a key role in the development of resources for the payment card industry. This approach makes sure that the content we publish is relevant and applicable to support security currently and for the future of the payments industry. In the past, SIGs developed guidance documents on container orchestration tools and cloud computing or best practices for securing e-commerce. All of those can be found in the Document Library of our website right now. As for how SIGs are developed, well the first step is Participating Organizations, which we've got representation from organizations across the entire payments ecosystem, the assessor community, Approved Scanning Vendors, or ASVs, and payment brands, they can propose a topic during the SIG proposal period. Then there's an election period where those topics are voted on by Participating Organizations, or POs, as I'll call them. POs get this final say to ensure that stakeholders who are involved in implementing and supporting PCI Security Standards are the ones that are selecting which SIG projects would be the most beneficial to their needs. So finally, the topic with the most votes by POs is selected and then we seek volunteers from the PO community and the assessor community to meet on a regular basis to develop content and pull from their expertise and extensive industry experience on that particular topic. So, that’s the process in a nutshell. It’s quite collaborative and really, it's a voice for the industry from the industry. And we're very glad that PCI SSC is the vehicle to drive this industry contribution and really that the industry is quite keen to contribute in this way. Alicia Malone: Well, PCI DSS is one of our most popular standards, so it makes sense that our industry would want more guidance on different aspects of it. What was your role as chair on this project? Kandyce Young: PCI DSS ultimately was developed to encourage and enhance payment account data security and to facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures all across the globe. With constant technological advancements being made with tools, security controls, and also with a variety of service provider offerings now available, there's bound to be some questions on how to keep all of this data secure in the face of this evolution. So as the chair of this project, my goal was to make sure that we stayed on track to provide these best practices or provide guidance on the core elements of this topic. We knew we wanted to dive deeper into scoping and segmentation practices for modern network architecture, but we also knew that we couldn't boil the ocean. So, we narrowed it down to five key areas: determining the impact of zero trust architecture on PCI DSS scope and network segmentation; looking at defining PCI DSS scope boundaries in micro segmentation and multi cloud implementations; looking at how to develop and maintain a PCI DSS asset inventory given the ephemeral nature of cloud-hosted microservices and systems; looking at the risks associated with the implementation of modern network architectures, given the complexity of these modern system configurations, because with the ease of use of modern network architecture, certainly brings about additional risks and often additional complexity that we must address. And finally, we wanted to provide guidance on specific PCI DSS requirements for verifying scope and segmentation controls, and I believe we did just that. Alicia Malone: So, what made this particular Special Interest Group stand apart from other Special Interest Groups that the Council has conducted in the past? What would you say were the components that really made this process so

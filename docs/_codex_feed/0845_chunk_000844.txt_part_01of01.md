8 Personal Property Securities Act 8.1 PPSA further steps If the Customer determines that the Protocol, these Bailment Terms or an Adherence Letter of the Cash Handler (or a transaction in connection with any of them) is or contains a security interest for the purposes of the PPSA, the Cash Handler agrees to do anything the Customer, the Co-owners or a nominee of them reasonably asks (such as obtaining consents, signing and producing documents and getting documents completed and signed) to: (a) ensure that the security interest is enforceable, perfected (including, where possible, by control in addition to registration) and otherwise effective; or (b) enable the Customer or Co-owners, or their nominee, to apply for any registration, or give any notification, in connection with the security interest so that the security interest has the priority required by the Customer (including a registration for whatever collateral class the Customer thinks fit and the Cash Handler consents to any such registration or notification and agrees not to make an amendment demand); or (c) enable the Customer or Co-owners (as applicable) to exercise rights in connection with the security interest. 8.2 Exclusion of PPSA provisions To the extent the law permits: (a) for the purposes of sections 115(1) and 115(7) of the PPSA: (i) a Co-owner need not comply with sections 95, 118, 121(4), 125, 130, 132(3)(d) or 132(4); and (ii) sections 142 and 143 are excluded; (b) for the purposes of section 115(7) of the PPSA, a Co-owner need not comply with sections 132 and 137(3); (c) if the PPSA is amended after the date of the Protocol to permit the Cash Handler and a Customer or all the Co-owners to agree to not comply with or to exclude other provisions of the PPSA, the Customer and all the Co-owners, or their nominee, (as applicable) may notify the Cash Handler that any of these provisions is excluded, or that the Customer or all the Co-owners, or their nominee, need not comply with any of these provisions as notified to the Cash Handler by all the Co-owners; and AUSTRALIAN CASH DISTRIBUTUTION AND EXCHANGE SYSTEM (CS5) PROCEDURES ANNEXURE K: CASH OWNERSHIP AND SECURITY PROTOCOL Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 115 (d) the Cash Handler agrees not to exercise its rights to make any request of a Co-owner or any nominee of the Co-owners under section 275 of the PPSA, to authorise the disclosure of any information under that section or to waive any duty of confidence that would otherwise permit non-disclosure under that section. 8.3 Exercise of rights by a Co-owner If a Co-owner exercises a right, power or remedy in connection with the Protocol, these Bailment Terms or an Adherence Letter of the Cash Handler, that exercise is taken not to be an exercise of a right, power or remedy under the PPSA unless the Co-owner states otherwise at the time of exercise. However, this clause does not apply to a right, power or remedy which can only be exercised under the PPSA. 8.4 No notice required unless mandatory To the extent the law permits, the Cash Handler waives: (a) its rights to receive any notice that is required by: (i) any provision of the PPSA (including a notice of a verification statement); or (ii) any other law before a secured party or Receiver exercises a right, power or remedy; and (b) any time period that must otherwise lapse under any law before a secured party or Receiver exercises a right, power or remedy. If the law which requires a period of notice or a lapse of time cannot be excluded, but the law provides that the period of notice or lapse of time may be agreed, that period or lapse is one day or the minimum period the law allows to be agreed (whichever is the longer). However, nothing in this clause prohibits a Co-owner or any Receiver from giving a notice under the PPSA or any other law. 9 Inconsistent terms If a provision of these Bailment Terms is inconsistent with another provision of the Protocol Covered Agreement, the provisions of these Bailment Terms prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. These Bailment Terms set out the provisions relating to the ownership and control of cash which have been agreed between the Cash Handler and a Customer of the holding of Cash in a Mixed Cash Pool. Any additional terms that may be implied under general law by virtue of any bailment created under these Bailment Terms are excluded to the extent they are not incorporated into these Bailment Terms. AUSTRALIAN CASH DISTRIBUTUTION AND EXCHANGE SYSTEM (CS5) PROCEDURES ANNEXURE K: CASH OWNERSHIP AND SECURITY PROTOCOL Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 116 10 Definitions and Interpretation Clause 10 of the Protocol (“Definitions and interpretation”) applies to these Bailment Terms and forms part of these Bailment Terms for the purpose of construing these Bailment Terms. To the extent permitted by law, the law of the Commonwealth as it applies in that jurisdiction governs this security.

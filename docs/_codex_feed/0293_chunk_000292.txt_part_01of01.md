process of dynamic thresholding is often used to retain this vital information and discard the background. This specification provides measurement methodologies to predict the outcome of dynamic thresholding, and ensures legibility and efficient processing of the documents. See Appendix B for more details. Successful imaging and recognition can be affected by many factors in the document design, Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 15 AusPayNet September 2017 including background colour, screening, background pattern of the document, security patterns, and the ink used to print the data. The effect of all these can be assessed by reflectance and contrast measurements. The dynamic thresholding method of measuring reflectance and contrast has been found to be superior to Print Contrast Signal measurements and is given consideration in this standard. Analysis tools that utilise images eliminate operator induced error as there will be no interpretation required to select the reflectance sample. Document colours that appear bright to the human eye will have high reflectance because they reflect most of the illuminating light. Conversely, printing that appears dark, absorbs most light and reflects little light, and is thus low in reflectance. Print Contrast Signal or PCS is a measure of the difference of reflectance of two adjacent regions, one of which is called the background region. PCS measurement always requires the selection of two regions of reflectance measurement, a print or data region and an adjacent background region, both of which are open to human interpretation. Dynamic Contrast Ratio (DCR) measurements are similar to PCS measurements but are done automatically and dynamically in an image processing computer program as specified in Appendices A and B. 1.5.3 Definitions Aligning Edge: The lower edge of the document when its face is viewed. Area Of Interest (AOI): Refers to a rectangular area 0.250 inch high along the length of each particular data element field. Average Area Reflectance (DC Image): With reference to dynamic contrast (DC) images within areas of interest, average area reflectance determination includes every pixel in a 0.125 inch square. Background Clutter: The remnants of background in a binary image that interferes with legibility of written or printed data. Background Reflectance: A calculation of background reflectance on the Amount in Figures rectangle, its Protection Area and the Optical MICR clear band. All pixels are averaged in the minimum area of 0.125 inch square. Binary Image: A black and white image where each pixel can be stored in memory by one bit of information since it is either black or white. Convenience Amount Recognition (CAR): A term used mainly in USA. In an image system, ICR is the application of Intelligent Character Recognition to the function of locating and recognising the characters in a convenience amount field. Data Elements: Information that is contained on a financial document that is legally necessary to convey funds. A signature, payee, name and amount are each examples of data elements which are legally necessary. Dynamic Contrast (DC) Image: A generic binary image, ie. a black and white image generated from a greyscale image by comparing the reflectance value of each pixel to the average of all pixels (including itself) in the 0.125 inch squares with the immediate surrounding area thereby allowing converting the pixel to a black or white image. Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 16 AusPayNet September 2017 Dynamic Contrast Ratio (DCR): The mathematical formula for creating a dynamic contrast image. It is the same as the formula for PCS, but the calculation is performed at a pixel level. In the DCR computation the background reflectance, Rb, is defined as the average of all pixels in a 0.125 inch square which includes the central pixel. The reflectance of the central pixel is Rc. See Appendix B. Dynamic Thresholding: The process used to convert a greyscale image to a binary (black and white) image. See Appendix B. Greyscale Image: An image where each pixel can have a full range of grey tonal values, between 16 and 256 levels, dependant on the system used. Human Visible Spectrum: The wavelengths of light that can be observed by the human eye, ranging between 400 and 700 nanometres, with the peak human response at 555 nanometres. These wavelengths span the full range of pure colours; 400 nanometres is perceived as deep blue, 550 nanometres is yellow-green, and 700 nanometres is deep red. Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR): In an image system, algorithms may be used to provide character or symbol recognition from the captured or stored image data. Imaging: A system based on monochrome scanning of financial documents, processing discrete picture elements to remove data redundancy, followed by compression and storage of the image data. Images can be retrieved, decompressed and displayed on image work stations, or printed on a printer either locally or remote to the storage site. Legible: That which is capable of being read or deciphered. Information that must be of sufficient quality to be viewed and seen easily, accurately, without ambiguity under the conditions specified. Legibility problems in cheque images are caused by two phenomena; firstly, low average background reflectance causes low contrast with written data, which then drops out of a binary image, and secondly, excessive background clutter remaining in a binary image interferes with human interpretation of written data. Optical Character Recognition (OCR): OCR is defined as the high speed process of converting machine printer

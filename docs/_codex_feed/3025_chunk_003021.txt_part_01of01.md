Recommendations For a relatively small additional cost (compared to a DV certificate), a legitimate business conducting e- commerce could purchase an OV or EV certificate. This would prove to the consumer the business was validated by the CA and has provided address and other independently verified contact information in the certificate that the consumer could use in case of questions or problems. In addition, EV certificates provide another benefit: a visual cue (the green bar) in the browser tells the consumer the business has gone through the effort to obtain this enhanced certificate, the information has been verified by the CA, and there is a higher probability that online trust can be established. The table below summarizes the various certificate levels. TLS Certificate Level Summaries Certificate type HTTPS encrypted? Padlock displayed? Domain validated? Address validated?

DV certs are acceptable when used between entities that have a formal business relationship and contract in place (which authenticates and documents the relationship between the entities), and the DV cert’s role is that of encrypting data-in-motion between the parties.  OV: A more secure step where the CA vets the business before issuance of the certificate, recommended for public-facing websites dealing with less sensitive information.  EV: The highest level of authentication of the business by the CA, recommended for websites handling CHD, PII, and other sensitive data.  It is recommended the certificates (certs) be configured to use the highest level of security available regardless of the type of certificate used. 4.2 TLS 1.2 Configurations 4.2.1 Importance of Modern Encryption for E-commerce PCI DSS Requirement 3 broadly delves into the protection methods for safeguarding stored CHD. In particular, Requirements 3.5 and 3.6 speak to the requirement to secure cryptographic keys and replace them when their integrity is weakened. In order to assure an orderly transition when a class of keys becomes weakened or an algorithm is no longer considered a strong cryptographic function, it is important that organizations enable support for modern encryption methods with high integrity well ahead of older algorithms being deprecated or disallowed. As an example, organizations deploying TLS need to be aware that different versions and configurations of TLS vary in the level of integrity provided, and simply deploying TLS does not protect against deprecation. The PCI SSC published Migrating from SSL and Early TLS to help organizations understand how to go about deprecation planning. Additional guidance and/or recommendations regarding modern TLS configurations can be found in NIST Special Publication 800-52 Revision 1, “Guidelines for the Selection, Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations.” (This publication provides a general TLS overview, recommended minimum server/cryptographic/TLS extensions requirements, and general operational considerations. As with all special publications, it is recommended that organizations periodically follow up with the source to determine whether any document revisions have been issued.) Organizations deploying TLS should ensure that they are using best practices for modern TLS. These may include:  Using and supporting only TLS 1.2, to ensure that modern encryption methods can be utilized for protecting data.  Separating authentication and key-agreement protocols to use different cryptographic keys, serving to reduce the impact of unauthorized key usage or key disclosure.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 40  Choosing key sizes and hash functions for digital signature generation and key agreement rated as acceptable by NIST Special Publication 800-57 Part 1 Revision 4, “Recommendation for Key Management” to assure integrity of the transaction.  Ensuring clients utilize current TLS options and ensuring servers select current TLS options when negotiating with clients. By adopting these practices now, organizations conducting e-commerce can help maintain trust by assuring continued protection of customer data and avoid compatibility challenges as older encryption algorithms weaken. 4.2.2 Certificate Transparency Certificate Transparency (CT) is a Google-initiated framework (defined at www.certificate- transparency.org) and is a new technique for further protecting the SSL/TLS ecosystem. At a high level, it requires CAs to submit information about each SSL/TLS certificate being issued to multiple CT log files. These log files can be viewed publicly, along with the domain name of the web server. The main advantage to CT is that an enterprise could monitor the CT log files and discover issuances of SSL/TLS certificates in its name that were not approved. For example, a company like Example Inc. might have a policy that “we only work with a particular CA, and any SSL/TLS certificate for https://*.example.com must be issued solely by that CA.” Example Inc. could then monitor the CT log files and learn

The PCI Security Standards Council, LLC (“PCI SSC”) sponsors this qualification and serves as an impartial, third-party evaluator of each candidate’s knowledge and understanding of PCI Standards. PCI SSC is an open global forum for the ongoing development, enhancement, storage, dissemination and implementation of security standards for account data protection. The purpose of these Payment Card Industry (PCI) Qualification Requirements for Payment Card Industry Professionals (PCIP) (the “PCIP Qualification Requirements”) is to provide the information required to apply for PCIP status by summarizing key aspects of the program and steps to earning and maintaining the PCIP credential. Questions about the program should be e-mailed to: pcip@pcisecuritystandards.org. 1.1 Overview of the PCIP Credential Through the process of becoming a PCIP, the candidate will gain knowledge of the PCI Standards and how they relate to one another. Subject to qualification-renewal requirements, the PCIP credential remains with the individual, which means that as individuals switch employers they are able to maintain the PCIP credential throughout the entirety of their career growth and professional development. Candidates must possess a base level of knowledge and awareness of information technology, network security and architecture, and payment industry participants prior to beginning the process of becoming a PCIP and are strongly encouraged to complete the PCIP training course offered by PCI SSC before taking the PCIP examination. Note: Individuals who are qualified and in good standing as QSA employees or ISAs (as defined in the applicable QSA and ISA program materials) throughout the PCIP application process (collectively, “Eligible QSA and ISA Individuals”) may apply for the PCIP credential and qualification without completing PCIP-specific exams or training or reporting the CPE hours required of non-assessor PCIPs, as addressed further below.

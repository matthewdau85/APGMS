work with their corporate customers to support this by offering debulking/ file translation services (i.e. taking a file with a number of payments and ‘debulking’ them into individual NPP payments). AP+ will focus on associated operational processes such as bulk returns, and other opportunities to support processing of payments created in bulk files. Supporting end-user readiness: A core focus for AP+, for NPP Participants and other payment service providers will be educating end-users on the benefits that can be unlocked and supporting their transition to this new system over time. We will continue to work closely with all market participants on supporting this transition as it ramps up in 2024 and beyond. Our other areas of focus for Payments & Schemes include: NPP Confirmation of Payee : since the announcement of an agreed industry design in late 2023, AP+ and NPP Participants conducted workshops in December 2023 to plan in detail the build and rollout of this capability in phases through 2024 and into 2025. BPAY Next Generation: we will focus in 2024 on work to support the evolution of one of Australia’s most loved and trusted payment brands. We will look to enhance the customer experience, seek to reduce or eliminate current pain points, and strengthen the product proposition by incorporating additional capabilities, to protect and grow BPAY for the next generation. eftpos Mobile Least Cost Routing : industry estimates suggest around half of transactions at point of sale occur using a mobile wallet. Accordingly, the RBA has set expectations that Least Cost Routing for mobile wallet transactions be supported by industry stakeholders by the end of 2024. AP+ is working with wallet providers to develop mobile LCR solutions and the first wallet is on track for issuer onboarding from early 2024 with a second wallet as a fast follower. eftpos Merchant Tokenisation : to ensure that increasing tokenisation of card numbers does not impact on merchants’ ability to route online transactions to the lowest cost scheme, the RBA expects AP+ to develop a solution to support core functionality of merchant tokenisation by March 2024, and to work with industry to integrate this solution by mid-2025. Payments Service Provider Licensing : the Australian Government continues to consult on the development of a modernised regulatory framework for payment service providers. The draft regulatory framework includes a new pathway for payment service providers (PSPs) to directly access payment systems such as those operated by AP+. In 2024 we will continue to work with government as it finalises this package of reforms and ensures that our access frameworks are aligned with these developments. AP+ Scheme Harmonisation : we kicked off a project to harmonise aspects of the scheme rules that govern the NPP, eftpos and the BPAY payment schemes, to unlock the considerable value in ensuring our operational structures and rules are consistently, simply, and efficiently articulated and applied across each of the AP+ Schemes. This work will continue in 2024, with a goal of moving to a new set of harmonized rules from 2025.

V2.0, 2017. https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/QSA_Program_Guide_v2.0_Dec.pdf Information Supplement • Best Practices for Maintaining PCI DSS Compliance • January 2019 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 27 The evidence-retention process should include safeguards to prevent and detect the altering, tampering, or destruction of evidence. The process should also identify whether any alterations are permitted to collected evidence, including any associated metadata, while in storage. If changes are permitted, the process should identity who is permitted to make such changes and outline a method to record who, what, how, why, and when changes are made. . While an Information Security Management Solution (ISMS) can be used for this purpose, the process can also be implemented using checklists, file and folder structures, and a combination of digital signatures and hashing (see Appendix D: PCI DSS Compliance Program Activities,” for an example of a template to document the retained evidence). 3.7 Detect and Respond to Security Control Failures It is critical that organizations are able to detect failures in security controls during the control-review or control-monitoring processes. It is also imperative that organizations have processes for responding to security control failures in a timely manner, and that those processes are periodically tested. In some cases, security control failures could constitute a formal security incident, which requires a more formal incident response. At a minimum, security control failure response processes should include: 3.7.1 Assigning Responsibility and Ownership for Detection and Response Processes Organizations should assign ownership and responsibility for detection and response to security control failures. The responsible team or individual should have a broad understanding of the organization’s business, operational and IT processes, and be able to quickly and efficiently respond to the identified failures in security controls that should be part of the control-review or control-monitoring processes. 3.7.2 Detecting Security Control Failure It is critical to detect security violations and identify the threats to systems in a timely manner. Detection can result from automated and/or manual controls⎯e.g., an alert from anti-malware solution or vulnerability scanning tool, or as part of a change-management process requiring analysis of all significant changes (PCI DSS Requirement 6.4.6). Formal processes can also assist in the detection and alerting of security control failures. The longer it takes to detect and respond to a failure, the higher the risk and potential cost of remediation. 3.7.3 Restoring Security Controls To ensure the security of the environment, security controls should be restored to normal operations as quickly as possible. The period during which security controls are not operating as intended could give an attacker an extended window to infiltrate the environment.

As such, it is critical to identify the cause of any failures in automated controls to ensure that the implemented corrective measures are appropriate and effective to address the problem. 3.7.5 Identifying and Addressing New Issues Failures in security controls can provide attackers with opportunities to launch other attacks within the environment. For example, a failure in a system’s anti-virus software could allow an attacker to install malware on that system. If intrusion-detection mechanisms reported increased activity during the window in which the anti-virus software was inoperable, the details of that activity may provide additional insight into the cause and potential impact of the original issue. 3.7.6 Implementing Failure-Mitigation Measures Organizations should periodically evaluate the automated security controls to identify potential failure points and attack vectors. Additional processes, controls, or countermeasures may be needed to mitigate the risk of failure or attack. Additionally, automated controls need to be properly configured to avoid inaccurate results. For example, if a Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) solution consistently provides false positives, personnel tasked with reviewing the alerts may begin to ignore the notifications⎯possibly containing actual security incident alerts. This type of activity represents a weak or absent control. Additional DLP configurations (i.e., algorithms or logic that determines events to alert against) or fine-tuning of existing settings may be needed to reduce false-positive alerts requiring review. 3.7.7 Employing Enhanced Monitoring Once the security control has been restored and the cause of the failure identified, it may be necessary to increase the monitoring frequency of the control to ensure the control is working as expected. Once the organization is satisfied that the control is operating correctly and no other issues with the control exist, standard monitoring frequencies may be resumed. 3.8 Maintain Security Awareness Data breaches are not limited to the exploitation of technical vulnerabilities⎯they are trending to also involve the use of social-engineering techniques. In such cases, an entity’s employees are lured into executing actions that allow threat actors to both deploy tools that will permit the exploitation of an existing vulnerability, as well as to create a new vulnerability to achieve exfiltration of critical data⎯in this specific case, cardholder data. While investing in security monitoring and access-management tools allow the entity to reduce their risk profile, these tools do not guarantee that risk can

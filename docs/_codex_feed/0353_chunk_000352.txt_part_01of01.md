Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals Our Commitment Introduction 1 Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals 6 ➜ Objective This document has been created to assist the payments community in the design and procurement of Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals using touchscreen technology for PIN entry, with the objective of improving the accessibility of these devices for people with vision and/or motor impairments. The Guidelines for PIN on glass (set out in Section 2) are a starting point for AusPayNet’s ongoing work in the area of enhancing accessibility in payments. AusPayNet supports the sentiments expressed in the 2019 Australian Payments Council (APC) Strategic Agenda, and specifically the requirement to improve accessibility and will continue to work with members to develop useability guidelines for payment product and service design more broadly. ➜ Scope of Guidelines The Guidelines set out in Section 2 specifically apply to the design of POS terminals using touchscreen technology which are: • Proprietary devices • Locked down Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) devices To support innovation, the Guidelines do not provide detailed technical solutions or a step-by-step guide for ensuring accessibility. They do, however, provide key principles and design considerations, allowing organisations involved in payments to continue to innovate, albeit with an enhanced understanding of the needs of the disability community. ➜ Adoption of Guidelines Adoption of the Guidelines is voluntary, but strongly encouraged. The Guidelines do not have the force of law and adopting the Guidelines does not guarantee fulfilment of legal responsibilities under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth), nor does it absolve any organisation from their obligation to comply with the requirements of that Act or any other relevant legislation. Organisations involved in the design and procurement of POS terminals using touchscreen technology should obtain their own advice in relation to their adoption of the Guidelines, and should take into consideration all related legislation, standards and frameworks that exist to support the needs of the disability community. ➜ Updating the Guidelines The Guidelines capture current-state technology possibilities. To accommodate future changes in technology, the Guidelines will be reviewed annually, and updated as necessary to maintain relevance. 1. Introduction Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals 7 1. INTRODUCTION ➜ Foundations for enhanced accessibility in payments Throughout our detailed consultation, we have captured feedback which goes beyond the scope of developing Guidelines for PIN on glass. This has resulted in Supplementary Accessibility Design Considerations, which are set out in Section 3 of this document. To enhance the understanding of some of the barriers faced by people living with disability, Section 4 provides background and supporting information. ➜ Payments Industry Support To develop the Guidelines, we established a Working Group comprising a cross-section of AusPayNet stakeholders, including: • ANZ • Australian Banking Association • Bendigo Bank • Commonwealth Bank of Australia • Diebold Nixdorf • eftpos • NAB • NCR • Tyro • Verifone • Westpac Group The Guidelines are also supported by AusPayNet’s Issuers and Acquirers Community (IAC), which brings a wider range of participants and systems operators together to support innovation. The aim of the Guidelines is to support the payments community in enabling people living with vision and / or motor impairments to: have options which as far as possible create a similar experience and outcomes as for other users access the touchscreen independently and with dignity enter their PIN securely ➜ ➜ ➜ Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals 8 1. INTRODUCTION ➜ Community Consultation AusPayNet embarked on a comprehensive consultation process to develop the Guidelines, which also resulted in the development of Supplementary Accessibility Design Considerations. The consultation process included focus groups and one-on-one interviews, which were supplemented by an online community survey, to ensure a deep understanding of the lived experience of people with vision and motor impairments and how barriers impact their ability to independently make payments using touchscreens. The consultation process was designed to: • Provide clarity on the scope of the Guidelines • Understand the impacts (including personal, financial and emotional) that come from not being able to use POS touchscreens independently • Ask for lived experiences of entering PINs when using POS touchscreens – what is important, what works well, what creates barriers, and specific requirements • Find out what is best practice and what a good payment experience using touchscreens could be, including practical ideas and examples of other touchscreen applications that work well for people with vision and / or motor impairment Individuals living with vision and / or motor impairments, as well as their carers and supporters, were invited to complete the online survey. The survey was accessed by 260 respondents (the majority - 88% - were individuals living with vision and / or motor impairment) during the 4-week period it was open, and feedback received reinforced the key themes captured during the overall consultation. Consultation with the disability community and their supporters included input from the following organisations: • Able Australia • Australian Human Rights Commission • Australian Network on Disability • Blind Citizens Australia • Centre for Inclusive Design • Cerebral Palsy Alliance • Digital Gap Initiative • Deafblind Australia • Guide Dogs • Macular Disease Foundation • People with Disability Australia • Public Interest Advocacy Centre • Royal Society for the Blind • TCC • Vision Australia ➜ Using this document This document provides: 1. Guidelines for designing accessible and secure PIN entry, including Five Key

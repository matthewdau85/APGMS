Close attention by Framework Participants to the completion of SWIFT PDS message details in accordance with these Procedures, will ensure the smooth and efficient operation of each Framework Participant’s own SWIFT PDS System and the SWIFT PDS as a whole.

Please refer to Part 5 of the Act for details.)287 8.2 Message Preparation Guidelines Message preparation guidelines, designed to assist in the straight through processing of SWIFT PDS payments, are set out in Annexure I.

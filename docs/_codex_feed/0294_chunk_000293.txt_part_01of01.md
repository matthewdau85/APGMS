from the captured or stored image data. Imaging: A system based on monochrome scanning of financial documents, processing discrete picture elements to remove data redundancy, followed by compression and storage of the image data. Images can be retrieved, decompressed and displayed on image work stations, or printed on a printer either locally or remote to the storage site. Legible: That which is capable of being read or deciphered. Information that must be of sufficient quality to be viewed and seen easily, accurately, without ambiguity under the conditions specified. Legibility problems in cheque images are caused by two phenomena; firstly, low average background reflectance causes low contrast with written data, which then drops out of a binary image, and secondly, excessive background clutter remaining in a binary image interferes with human interpretation of written data. Optical Character Recognition (OCR): OCR is defined as the high speed process of converting machine printer numerals, letters and symbols into computer processable information by an optical scanning system. Optical Clear Band: A 0.300 inch high band which has included within it the MICR print band. Both bands are co-located in the 5/8 inch clear band (16mm MICR clear band) across the bottom of the form. Amended, effective 19/05/08 Paxel: A group of black pixels (equal to or more than 6 of 9) in a binary image, measuring 0.010 inch square, that is the smallest dark area of background clutter which has been determined to affect the legibility of hand-written data on cheques. Paxel Count/String: The number of contiguous paxels that, when joined in any shape, line or combination, can create a background clutter problem that can affect the legibility of hand-written data on cheques. Pixel: A contraction of “picture element”, the smallest area of a document considered Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 17 AusPayNet September 2017 in capturing an electronic image. Common pixel densities in imaging are 200 and 240 pixels per inch. Print Contrast: The difference between the reflectance of a printed point and the reflectance of the background on which it is printed. Print Contrast Signal (PCS): The ratio of the print contrast of a particular printed point with respect to the reflectance of a reference or background region. See Appendices A and B. Reflectance: The relative brightness of an illuminated paper surface, as seen by the human eye, indicated by values between 0 and 100%. The eye modifies the apparent brightness at different wavelengths according to its response to the human visible spectrum. Equipment that measures reflectance requires a filter that matches its response to that of the human eye. The smallest sample used is usually a 0.008 inch circular aperture in order to average out effects of dots in screened printing. 1.5.4 Background Reflectance and PCS Specifications It has been found that PCS measurements are not always adequate to determine precisely what will remain in a binary (black and white) image. PCS can only predict scanner performance in a very localised area with absolutely uniform background. Most documents, however, have a continuously varying background and require a more dynamic approach, such as used in industry reader/sorter scanners. Furthermore, PCS will not predict to what degree background clutter in a binary image will constitute a threat to legibility of hand-written data. However, actual binary images, termed dynamic contrast images in their generic form, can be used for this evaluation. An automated method of creating a DC image and counting clusters of black pixels, called Paxel Count, is described in Appendix B. Manual reflectance measurements for the Amount in Figures rectangle, its Protection Area and the MICR optical clear band can be made taking multiple samples within the 0.125 inch x 0.125 inch AOI. Reflectance and PCS calculations shall be made using a reflectance measurement system having a circular aperture of 0.008 inch in the local background and averaging these measurements (see Appendix B for more details). This method of measuring background reflectance assumes that the background of the payment document in the regions of interest is relatively uniform, otherwise a large number of area samples must be taken in the area of interest for each data element to reliably determine its representative background reflectance.PCS within the Amount in Figures/Total Amount rectangle, its Protection Area and the MICR optical clear band, is calculated by measuring the reflectance of a candidate pattern point with a circular aperture of 0.008 inch. Measurements in the AOI’s (Areas Of Interest) which include the date, payee, amount-in- words, and signature fields should be made assuming that the user data are contained in horizontally oriented AOI rectangles sized at 0.250 inch (top to bottom) and having a length equal to the line length for each field, but not including the line.

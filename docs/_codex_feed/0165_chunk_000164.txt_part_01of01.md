discover the latest evolution from GLEIF on the LEI. The Bank for International Settlements’ Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) published their Final Report: Harmonised ISO 20022 data requirements for enhancing cross-border payments . The CPMI encourages payment system operators and participants to implement practices that support consistent formatting and transmittal of payment messages. The RBA and AusPayNet welcome the BIS CPMI harmonised ISO 20022 data requirements for cross-border payments and will align its ISO 20022 message usage guidelines by the end of 2027. CPMI recently established an API Panel of Experts (CPMI APEX). The panel will evaluate proposals for API standards in cross-border payment information exchange, develop recommendations for greater harmonisation of APIs, and develop a longer-term global governance proposal and process. We are pleased that Australia has a representative on this important panel. We will expect more details in the near future, given that the first meeting was in September 2023. Generic Underpinning Actions As part of the Industry Taskforces action item, both CPMI and the FSB have established new taskforces to assist them in taking forward the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-Border Payments. CPMI has established the Payments Interoperability and Extension (PIE) Taskforce . This has brought together firms that offer cross-border payment services, payment system operators, and relevant industry associations. The PIE Taskforce has had two meetings. Agenda and meeting artefacts have been published by CPMI and are available here . In essence, discussions were had on ISO 20022 harmonisation, an update on the FSB's key performance indicators measuring progress towards the targets, and discussions on practical actions to enhance cross-border payments. FSB has established the Legal, Regulatory, and Supervisory Matters (LRS) Taskforce . This has brought together firms that offer cross-border payment services, payment system operators, and relevant industry associations with significant experience and responsibilities in compliance, legal, risk management, and cross-border payment operations. The LRS Taskforce will provide input and feedback on frictions in legal, regulatory or supervisory frameworks related to the provision of cross-border payments and relevant data-related frameworks. The LRS Taskforce has had one meeting. Agenda and meeting artefacts have been published by the FSB and are available here . In summary, discussions were had on fostering a level playing field among participants by promoting more convergence and clarity around supervisory matters, as well as AML/CTF issues. They also discussed opportunities around increasing standardisation of data requirements and agreed that areas of focus for the Taskforce would be driven by the deliverables of the FSB. Monitoring and reporting are an important in improving cross-border payments. To that end, the FSB has published its Annual Progress Report on Meeting the Targets for Cross-Border Payments . This set of global Key Performance Indicators shows more work needs to be done to achieve the targets, but also notes that global KPIs cannot provide the whole story of diverse and complex payment systems. This issue was recognised by CBPAC several years ago, as it started its journey on benchmarking. When reviewing the FSB's KPIs, Australia is within East Asia and Pacific. Taking the Roadmap Forward Work continues in other areas that may support ongoing evolution on cross-border payments. In particular, Project Mandala explores the feasibility of encoding jurisdiction-specific policy and regulatory requirements into a common protocol for cross-border use cases, such as foreign direct investment, borrowing, and payments. Project Mandala is a proof-of-concept run by BISIH Singapore Centre, the RBA, the Bank of Korea (BOK), the Central Bank of Malaysia (BNM), and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), in collaboration with financial institutions, and seeks to ease the policy and regulatory compliance burden by automating compliance procedures, providing real-time transaction monitoring, and increasing transparency and visibility around country-specific policies. In doing so, it aims to address key challenges identified during Project Dunbar , which developed an experimental multiple central bank digital currency (mCBDC) platform. Work also continues on Project Polaris by the BIS Innovation Hub, with the recent release of Part 4: A high-level design guide for offline payments with CBDC . For further reference, BIS Innovation Hub projects are catalogued here and cover a range of investigatory experiments in CBDCs, stablecoins, compliance, AML and APIs, much of which may have utility for improving cross-border payments. The G20 New Delhi Leaders’ Declaration reaffirmed their commitment to the effective implementation of the prioritised actions for the next phase of the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-Border Payments to achieve the global targets for faster, cheaper, transparent and inclusive cross-border payments by 2027. The G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting in Marrakesh also fully endorsed the roadmap in their Communique . CPMI and FSB Milestones for 2023 Appendix 1

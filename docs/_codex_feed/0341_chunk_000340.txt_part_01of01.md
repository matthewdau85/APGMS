use reasonable endeavours to provide a response to the Applicant within a period of five weeks from the date the application is accepted by AusPayNet. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 65 AusPayNet September 2017 1.5 Field Testing Amended, effective 22/03/06 The field testing procedure is designed to examine the quality of the output of a Printing System when set up according to the Applicant's instructions and using paper that conforms to AS 2277. In particular, the aim of field testing is to check that the documents produced by the Printing System are sufficiently robust to perform satisfactorily on the reading equipment used by Tier 1A Participating Members. The assessment of the robustness of the document comprises of a series of test runs through the testing Members’ MICR reading equipment. The tests should cover the full range of machines used by Tier 1A Participating Members taking into account technology, age and speed. The Printing System must be tested on at least one high speed machine and one medium/low speed machine. AusPayNet maintains a list of Tier 1A Participating Members available to conduct field testing. AusPayNet, in its absolute discretion, will determine which Tier 1A Participating Members will conduct field testing in respect to any application. AusPayNet, in its absolute discretion, will also determine if a minimum of two or a maximum of three independent field tests will be conducted in respect to any application. Where two independent field tests are conducted, the Printing System must pass both field tests. Where three independent field tests are conducted, the Printing System must pass a minimum of two independent field tests. Testing Tier 1A Participating Members must use reasonable endeavours to complete field testing within a period of four weeks from receipt of the application by the Tier 1A Participating Members. 1.5.1 The Operation of Field testing 1.5.1.1 What Codeline should be used in the field test? The MICR code line used in the field testing must:  be agreed between the Applicant and the relevant Tier 1A Participating Member conducting the test; and  be in the Australian format and include BSB, account number and serial number fields, the serial number being sequential to uniquely identify each document; and  include at least one of each E-13B character (with the exception of the amount symbol). If the Printing System being examined is capable of printing in both landscape and portrait orientation and both are to be used, then both must be tested. Samples of MICR code lines containing single numeric characters must also be run, each of the ten numerals being included, to test for possible substitutions. The printed numerals shall cover the maximum range that the testing Tier 1A Participating Members’ equipment will read and are to be in a format agreed between the testing Members and the Applicant. 1.5.1.2 Test Samples The Applicant should provide test samples printed on an approved grade of cheque paper and a size that meets current specifications, 8 1/4 inch x 3 2/3 inch (2l0mm x 93mm) is MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 66 AusPayNet September 2017 currently recommended. Test samples must contain identification markings for the test being conducted eg testing Tier 1A Participating Member, stock, print orientation, but they do not need to contain a pre- printed design. The table below shows the minimum number of samples that are required to be provided by an Applicant. Additional test samples should be provided to allow for any damage that occurs during the test process. Reader/Sorter Speed Printer Speed (A4 pages per minute) Rated Speed 20 or less 21 to 89 90 or more High speed 100 250 1,000 Medium/low speed 50 100 250 Single Digit 10 10 10 codeline 1.5.1.3 Reference Samples A set of reference samples must be used to check the operating condition of the equipment. The quantity of samples is to be equal to the number specified at section 1.5.1.2. The samples will be supplied by AusPayNet to Applicants on request, subsequent to reviewing the testing application. 1.5.1.4 Condition of the testing Member’s equipment The equipment to be used for the test should be cleaned and adjusted so that its document reject rate is in the range usually experienced for that equipment, and is acceptable to the testing Tier 1A Participating Member. 1.5.2 The Tests The various tests involved in the field testing procedure are as follows. 1.5.2.1 The Reader/Sorter Test The testing Tier 1A Participating Member will perform a reader/sorter test on the test and reference samples. This test will comprise the following:  High speed machines - 10 passes of the quantity of documents specified at section 1.5.1.2 per orientation.  Low speed machines - 10 passes of the quantity of documents specified at section 1.5.1.2 per orientation. If during any pass, a jam or other operational failure occurs, then any damaged samples are to be removed and their number noted and thereafter deducted from the number of documents sorted. These damaged documents are not to be recorded as rejects. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 67 AusPayNet September 2017 Any documents rejected during a test must not be removed, but their number and pass stage must be recorded as rejects. The results of the test are to be recorded on Form 1 and signed by an appropriately senior officer of the testing Tier 1A Participating Member, refer

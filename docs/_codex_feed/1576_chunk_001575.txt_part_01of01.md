UNCLASSIFIED EXTERNAL 4 All SBR-certified software products must be whitelisted to utilise ATO production services. Whitelisting enables the ATO to manage the use of our services, which may include de- whitelisting where required. De-whitelisting is the process of suspending or removing access to the ATO production or test environments. De-whitelisting may occur where a Digital service provider (DSP) is not compliant with our requirements or where a cyber incident presents a risk to our digital wholesale channel, ATO reputation or taxpayers. The ATO will always endeavour to work through identified issues with DSPs. However, a failure to respond and adequately address issues will result in de-whitelisting. The SBR Conditions of Use enables the ATO to lawfully suspend or terminate any software product, report or information from access to SBR services. The purpose of this document is to provide clarification on the situations and process of de- whitelisting. It considers the triggers, response and factors for re-whitelisting. De-whitelisting can be initiated for several different reasons. The type of de-whitelisting that occurs is dependent upon the unique circumstances of each case. The triggers for de-whitelisting include: 1. ATO initiated immediate de-whitelisting will occur where the data held by a DSP or their systems have been compromised, resulting in the loss of either of the following: • Confidentiality of tax and super data • Integrity or availability of ATO digital wholesale channels 2. ATO initiated delayed de-whitelisting will occur where immediate de-whitelisting is not required. As part of this process the ATO will: • Provide written and verbal notification to the DSP of the issue(s) and actions required • issue the DSP with an initial warning of the intent to de-whitelist, including the proposed date for de-whitelisting • notify the DSPs clients of the intent to de-whitelist • issue a final notice to the DSP that includes a scheduled date for de- whitelisting actions to occur. Usually DSPs are provided seven (7) to fourteen (14) days for action to take place, however this will depend on the volume of transactions made by the DSP’s clients • issue a notification to inform the DSP that de-whitelisting has occurred Introduction De-whitelisting triggers UNCLASSIFIED EXTERNAL 5 In addition to the above ATO initiated reasons, a DSP may also request de-whitelisting of their product(s) should it be required. 3. DSP initiated de-whitelisting can be either immediate or delayed/scheduled at the request of the DSP. DSPs can request de-whitelisting of their product(s) by: • Contacting their DPO Account manager directly • Logging a request via Online Services for DSPs • Emailing DPO@ato.gov.au Digital service providers are required to report all cyber security incidents to the ATO. Where security incidents arise, the ATO may de-whitelist a DSP product or access to a single service (API). The ATO’s reputation as a secure data custodian is integral to ensuring taxpayer’s confidence and the use of digital platforms and technologies continue to be a secure and contemporary experience. There are several ways a security incident may be identified. These include but are not limited to: • ATO Cyber Security monitoring • direct notification from impacted DSPs • direct notification from impacted taxpayers, employers or super funds • direct notification from impacted tax or BAS agents. The severity of security incidents is also a factor for consideration, this includes: 1. A major security incident is an event where a DSP’s system or data security have been compromised, resulting in loss of confidentiality of tax and superannuation related data or loss of integrity or availability of ATO digital wholesale channels. This includes issues within a DSPs product that cause disruptions to ATO wholesale services This will result in immediate de-whitelisting. 2. A moderate security incident is an event where a DSPs system may have been compromised, however the tax or superannuation related data either remains secure or very limited exposure. This may result in delayed/scheduled de-whitelisting. Security incidents UNCLASSIFIED EXTERNAL 6 Circumstances where a DSP may be de-whitelisted includes but is not limited to: Event Immediate de-whitelisting Delayed de-whitelisting Major security incident Yes N/A Moderate security incident Potential Potential Non-compliance with mandatory obligations. This may include: • DSP Operational Framework • Product Verification Testing • Data quality • Service specific terms and conditions (eg SuperTICK, SuperMatch and MAAS) No Yes Breach of fair use of ATO systems Potential Potential De-whitelisting circumstances UNCLASSIFIED EXTERNAL 7 The following process outlines a general approach; however, each de-whitelisting will be dependent on the specific circumstances. Delayed de-whitelisting process ATO DSP DSP’s Clients Phase Notify DSP of the issue and work with them to achieve resolution Resolve identified issues within timeframe? Provide suitable evidence to the ATO to resolve issue Yes Product remains whitelisted Provide DSP with initial warning and intent to de-whitelist No If appropriate notify DSP’s clients with our intention to de-whitelist product Notify DSP of the scheduled de- whitelisting date De-whitelist product from ATO digital wholesale services Notify DSP of de- whitelisting Find a new software product Depending on the circumstance notify DSP of intention to contact their clients

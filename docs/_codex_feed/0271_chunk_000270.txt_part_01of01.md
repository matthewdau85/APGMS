According to the 2024 Australian Payment Fraud Report , there was a 22 per cent increase in the payment card fraud rate to 70.2 cents per $1,000 in calendar year 2023, the highest rate recorded since 2018. The figures show a 32 per cent increase year-on-year in the total value of fraud to $762 million. This increase outpaced the growth in the total value of card transactions, which rose by 8 per cent to $1.1 trillion. Card-Not-Present (CNP) fraud accounted for 90 per cent of all card fraud in Australia in 2023. CNP fraud grew by 33 per cent to $688 million, on total CNP spending of $320 billion, up 24 per cent on the previous year. The growth in CNP fraud was fuelled by a sharp rise in offshore CNP fraud, involving Australian-issued cards used on overseas merchants. For the first time since 2017, offshore CNP fraud overtook domestic CNP fraud, with losses in this category increasing by 51 per cent to $362 million. The offshore CNP fraud rate was $10.93 per $1,000 spent, over 10 times higher than the domestic rate of $1.06 per $1,000 spent (down from $1.11 in 2022).

Real property transfers report (RPTR) XML version 2.1 Original Published Date 27/09/2017 - 3:30pm Description An xml schema package of the Real property transfers report (RPTR) has been released as final. This xml package is to be used in the development of software for the electronic lodgment of the Real property transfers report (RPTR) for the 2017 and subsequent financial years. Subdivision 396-B creates a new third party reporting regime in Schedule 1 to the T axation Administration Act 1953 . This regime requires entities to report information to the Commissioner of Taxation about transactions that could reasonably be expected to have tax consequences for other entities. From 1 July 2016, states and territories will provide information on real property transfers including information that relates to the identification of the entities for which a tax-related liability may arise. This ensures that information received by the Commissioner can be matched to the relevant entity for the purposes of pre-filling and compliance. A legislative instrument changed the reporting period from financial year to quarterly. States and territories will provide quarterly reports in the approved form, the Real property transfers report , setting out information held about transfers by an entity of a freehold or leasehold interest in real property situated in the state or territory that happened during this period. The information will be provided in one report for each state and territory before the 31 st day after each period of 3 months ending on 30 September, 31 December, 31 March and 30 June. Real property transfers report (RPTR) XML version 1.0 has been decommissioned. All reporters should use version 2.0 of the reporting specification. A flat file version of this report can also be used. Refer to Real property transfers report (RPTR) . Reason for Amendment The RPTR XML package has been updated to cater for an update to a Warning message (CMN.ATO.RPTR.00820). This warning message update has caused a change to the Validation Rules, Message Repository and the Response Message Structure Table within the zipped package. Last modified date 07 Dec 2017

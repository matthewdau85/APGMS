AP+ held our latest End User Forum on 30 March 2023. The forum is a gathering of business associations, merchants and retailers along with representatives from business and corporate payments providers, digital and online payments businesses, and government. It’s an opportunity for AP+ to hear directly from our end users on topics that are of key interest. There are few topics in the Digital Identity space as important as trust – how can we collectively establish systems that Australians trust to share their digital identity safely? The forum began with a fireside chat between AP+ CEO, Lynn Kraus and the Hon. Victor Dominello MP, NSW Minister for Customer Service and Digital Government on the potential for digital identity in Australia. He provided a great overview of state and federal government progress in developing their own Digital ID programs. John Jones, Partner Digital Identity at Deloitte shared insights on how global trends in digital identity can inform success for Australia. John provided some great examples of countries that were leading the way in digital identity adoption and what lessons we could learn from them. John was then joined by Natalie Reed, Director Digital Identity at Deloitte for a Q&A. Andrew Black, MD ConnectID at AP+ provided an overview of ConnectID and then chaired a discussion on Delivering on the promise of trusted digital identity for customers . The panel included Linden Dawson, Senior Product Manager Customer Digital Identity NAB, Katherine Sleeth, General Manager Open Data Commbank and Greg Magill, Head of Digital Development Westpac. Finally, Dave Ellett, AP+ MD Commercial provided an update on AP+ and invited his colleagues, May Lam AP+ CIO and Andrew Black, MD ConnectID, to the stage for a Q&A with the forum attendees. Throughout each of the discussions, our excellent MC, Naomi Simson, AP+ Independent Board Member kept the flow of questions from the audience going, ensuring the voices of all our participants were heard. It was clear from the questions, discussion, and feedback that the theme of trust resonated with our end users. AP+ remains committed to working with government, our banking partners and with businesses to enable Australians to share their digital identity safely.

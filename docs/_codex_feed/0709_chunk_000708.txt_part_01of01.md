(amendment 2 to AS 2805.2-2007). Next page is Annexure D IAC CODE SET VOLUME 6 – ATM SYSTEM CODE ANNEXURE D. COMMUNICATIONS PHILOSOPHY Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 90 COMMUNICATIONS PHILOSOPHY There are a number of statements which together may be seen as encapsulating the philosophy for communications between any two Interchange parties. (a) A communications link will be maintained between the two interchange nodes for testing purposes. This link will remain in place indefinitely after testing the initial implementation to enable bilateral testing of modifications and enhancements. (b) Sufficient lines will be provided between the parties production sites such that, should any single line become inoperative, the remaining lines will be able to carry the anticipated peak load of Interchange Transactions at that time. (c) The parties will seek to have production Interchange line connected by alternative routes to minimise the impact of single communication network failures. (d) The parties will regularly ensure that each Interchange Link installed is operational, so that the loss of one Interchange Link will not cause a total loss of service. (e) Triple DES, line encryption must be used across all production lines. Next page is Annexure E IAC CODE SET VOLUME 6 – ATM SYSTEM CODE ANNEXURE E.

​Australian Payments Plus achieves Bronze AWEI Foundation status. Australian Payments Plus (AP+) is delighted to announce that we have been awarded Bronze Foundation status in the Australian Workplace Equity Index (AWEI) from Pride in Diversity. AWEI Index is Australia’s definitive national benchmark on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer workplace inclusion. Work on achieving the status was driven by the AP+ Pride group, made up of LGBTQ+ employees and their many allies who share a passion for enhancing workplace inclusion and promoting diversity. Lynn Kraus, CEO of AP+ and sponsor of the AP+ Pride Group said, ‘Shortly after AP+ was established in February last year, one of our team, Jay Lynch-Waters, approached me asking to set up a Pride Group. I immediately and enthusiastically said “Yes!” and the group was born. In a few months Jay and his co-chair Paul Nicholas had a charter, they’d held some inclusivity training and decided to embark on the highly ambitious project of achieving AWEI status. Now just 20 months after we were formed, AP+ has Bronze status. I couldn’t be more proud.’ Jay Lynch-Water co-chair of the AP+ Pride group said, ‘Looking ahead, the journey towards LGBTQ+ inclusion at AP+ is an ongoing mission. We will continue to champion more comprehensive policies, guidelines, and foster a more inclusive environment where everyone feels valued.’ Ben Brown, Senior Relationship Manager with ACON’s Pride Inclusion Programs, said, ‘It has been an absolute pleasure supporting the team at AP+ on their journey to creating an LGBTQ+ inclusive workplace. To achieve Bronze in the AWEI in such a short period of time is a massive achievement. Well done!’​ The AP+ Pride Group is one of a number of employee-led initiatives under an Affinity banner which also include: Positive Impact, our ESG-focused group; empowher, our group focused on female inclusion; our Reconciliation Action Plan group; and Doing Good, our group focused on charitable activities.

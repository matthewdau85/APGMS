Industry taskforces CPMI’s public and private sector engagement continues through the Payments Interoperability and Extension (PIE) Taskforce. It recently posted a webinar on its key deliverables. The PIE Taskforce also issued an invitation to market stakeholders to join it, as part of a renewal of its membership base to further increase geographic representation and include a diversity of business models. With much of the policy development completed, the FSB’s focus has turned to implementation of the policy recommendations, as well as to addressing any other legal, regulatory and supervisory frictions that have been identified as significant impediments to achieving the goals of the G20 Roadmap. The FSB, too, has invited organisations that offer cross-border payment services and relevant industry associations to nominate senior representatives to serve on the FSB’s Taskforce on Legal, Regulatory, and Supervisory matters to deliver on these goals. The CPMI’s other area of focus is its cross-border data exchange and message standards work, which is being undertaken by the API Panel of Experts. A significant piece of its recent work was the October 2024 publication of its Report to the G20: Promoting the harmonisation of application programming interfaces to enhance cross-border payments: recommendations and toolkit . The transfer of data across borders is essential to the functioning of the cross-border payments system. The FSB notes in its Final Report: Recommendations to Promote Alignment and Interoperability Across Data Frameworks Related to Cross-border Payments that greater alignment and interoperability of data frameworks would improve efficiency in transferring payments data across borders. This report outlines recommendations for promoting alignment and interoperability across data frameworks applicable to cross-border payments. ISO 20022 The Bank for International Settlements and CPMI have taken further steps to promote ISO 20022 harmonisation for enhanced cross-border payments. To support maintenance and encourage global adoption of the harmonised data requirements, the CPMI will establish a joint panel with members from the ISO 20022 global market practice groups. The CPMI also encourages industry to develop global ISO 20022 market practice guidelines for fast payments (also referred to as instant payments) based on the harmonised data requirements. Additionally, the CPMI will continue to engage with payment system operators and payment service providers to encourage them to implement the harmonised data requirements by end-2027. This will be supported by central banks and the PIE Taskforce. ISO 20022 migration Following the completion of the migration of AusPayNet’s 50 HVCS Participants to the use of ISO 20022, we published our final Migration Monitor newsletter in December. You can find the newsletter on our website . Device approval process On 1 January, a revised version of AusPayNet’s device approval process came into effect. In our latest blog , we have provided important information about the revised process. Economic crime Economic Crime Forum (ECF) The next ECF will be held in Melbourne on 25 February, coinciding with national law enforcement meetings hosted by Victoria Police. In 2025, law enforcement is seeking to further collaborate with banks to identify and disrupt money laundering networks that enable financial crime. For every scam, criminals need to launder the proceeds. Making laundering more difficult increases the chance of repatriating funds to victims and/or stopping the proceeds of scams from leaving the regulated market. Card-not-present (CNP) fraud AusPayNet is working with industry on root cause analysis and potential solutions for mitigating overseas CNP fraud on Australian-issued cards. While overseas spend on Australian-issued cards accounts for only 3 per cent of overall card spend, it accounts for 51 per cent of all card fraud (the rise of scams compounds in Southeast Asia is a suspected contributing factor). For more information on CNP fraud, read our recently published FY24 card fraud snapshot blog . eConveyancing Payments Industry Code AusPayNet continues to work with the Australian Registrars' National Electronic Conveyancing Council (ARNECC) to ensure a smooth and orderly establishment of the Code and effective adoption of the Code by both Electronic Lodgment Network Operators and financial institutions. With membership of the Code flagged as a new requirement in the latest draft of ARNECC’s Model Operating Requirements (MoRs), AusPayNet proposes to stand up the Code and welcome applications to membership in advance of these draft MoRs becoming effective. Stakeholder engagement Our Stakeholder Advisory Council met in December 2024. At this meeting, we sought the Council’s feedback and perspectives on: Our payment policy priorities (the SPF and RBA Review) AusPayNet's plan to coordinate the wind-down of the cheques system The transition from BECS The proposed cash acceptance mandate by Treasury Artificial intelligence in payments. We also thanked our Council Chair and AusPayNet Board member, Kate Mulligan, who has stepped down from the Board (and therefore as Chair of the Council). Kate has been instrumental in ensuring Council’s objective is met and that stakeholders' views have been heard and considered by our Board. At our next Council meeting in February, we will welcome our new Chair, Cathie Armour, who is joining AusPayNet’s Board as an independent Director.

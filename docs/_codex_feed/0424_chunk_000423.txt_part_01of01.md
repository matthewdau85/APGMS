SUMMARY 1.1. Overview These guidelines have been prepared and endorsed by the Management Committee. They are not mandatory rules but intended to guide the Tier 1 Framework Participants when exercising discretion to determine what action is to be taken in response to a Disabling Event. Each Disabling Event should be treated on its merits. 1.2. Settlement Unless specifically deferred, settlement will not be affected by the occurrence of a Disabling Event. Settlement will always be effected on the exchange balances. 585 1.3. Interest As covered in PART 9, clause 9.2.6, interest will be payable (as normal) on any exchanged Item in respect of which, settlement is effected later than the day on which that Item is exchanged for value. 586 Debit Items Where a Disabling Event occurs and other Tier 1 Framework Participants are asked, by a Disabled Framework Participant, to hold Debit Files that would have been exchanged in those other Members’ outward exchanges if not for a Disabling Event, those held Debit Files should retain the original PD-Day. When those Files are actually exchanged, interest will be payable by the Disabled Framework Participant from the PD-Day until the date settlement of those Debit Items is effected. No interest is payable with respect to any Debit Items held unexchanged by a Disabled Framework Participant where the Disabled Framework Participant holds the Items because of a Disabling Event affecting its outward exchanges. Credit Items Where a Disabling Event occurs and other Tier 1 Framework Participants are asked, by a Disabled Framework Participant, to hold Credit Items that would have been exchanged in those other Members’ outward exchanges if not for a Disabling Event, no interest will be payable to the Disabled Framework Participant. No interest is payable with respect to any Credit Items held unexchanged by a Disabled Framework Participant where the Disabled Framework Participant holds the Items because of a Disabling Event affecting its outward exchanges. 585 Last amended effective 21/5/12, version 047 r&p 001.12 586 Last amended effective 21/5/12, version 047 r&p 001.12 BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES ANNEXURE I: CONTINGENCY PROCEDURES FOR DISABLING EVENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 152 2.

your vendor or service provider how it notifies you o new security patches, and make sure you receive and read these notices. WHICH VENDORS SEND YOU PATCHES? You may get patches from vendors of your payment terminal, payment applications, other payment systems (tills, cash registers, PCs, etc.), operating systems (Android, Windows, iOS, etc.), application software (including your web browser), and business software. MAKE SURE your vendors update your payment terminals, operating systems, etc. so they can support the latest security patches. Ask them. E-COMMERCE MERCHANTS. Installing patches as soon as possible is very important for you too. Also look out for patches from your payment service provider. Ask your e-commerce hosting provider whether they patch your system (and how often). Make sure they update the operating system, e-commerce platform and/ or web application so it can support the latest patches. FOLLOW your vendor’s/service provider’s instructions and install those patches as soon as possible. Software can have flaws that are discovered after release, caused by mistakes made by programmers when they wrote the code. These flaws are also called security holes, bugs or vulnerabilities. Hackers exploit these mistakes to break into your computer and steal account data. Protect your systems by applying vendor-supplied “patches” to fix coding errors. Timely installation of security patches is crucial! It is important that you know how your software is being regularly updated with patches and who is responsible (it could be you!). Also, some patches install automatically when they become available. If you’re not sure how patches get added or who is responsible, make it a point to ask your vendor/ supplier. 17 Data Security Essentials for Small Merchants: Guide to Safe Payments Copyright 2024 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved. Protect in-house access to your data ACCESS CONTROL IS ALL IMPORTANT. Set up your system to grant access only based on a “business need-to-know.” As the owner, you have access to everything. But most employees can do their job with access only to a subset of data, applications, and functions. LIMIT ACCESS to payment systems and unencrypted card data to only those employees that need access, and only to the data, applications and functions they need to do their jobs. KEEP A LOG. Track all “behind the counter” visitors in your establishment. Include name, reason for visit, and name of employee that authorized visitor’s access. Keep the log for at least a year. SECURELY DISPOSE OF DEVICES. Ask your payment system vendor or service provider how to securely remove card data before selling or disposing of payment devices (so data cannot be recovered). SHARE THIS INFORMATION. Give this guide to your employees, business partners, and third-party service providers (such as e-commerce hosting providers) so they know what is expected. MAKE USER IDS UNIQUE for each person with access to your payment system whenever possible. This will help you keep track of who logs in and when, and any changes they make. Cost Ease Risk Mitigation Consider giving employees access to take payments but not to process refunds, or to take new bookings/ orders but not to access payment card data related to existing booking/orders.

All Rights Reserved. Don’t give hackers easy access to your systems If your vendor supports or troubleshoots your payment system from their office (and not from your location) they are using the Internet and remote access software to do this. Examples of products your vendor may install on your terminal and use to support you remotely include VNC & LogMeIn. Cost Ease Risk Mitigation FIND OUT. Ask your payment system vendor or service provider if they use remote access to support or access your business systems. ASK HOW TO LIMIT USE OF REMOTE ACCESS. Many remote access programs are always on, or always available by default, meaning the vendor can access your systems remotely all the time (this also means that hackers can access your systems too since many vendors use commonly-known passwords for remote access). Reduce your risk – ask your vendor how to disable remote access when not needed, and how to enable it when your vendor or service provider specifically equests it. DISABLE IT WHEN DONE. To protect your business, it’s important that you take a part in managing how and when your vendors can access your systems. USE STRONG AUTHENTICATION. If you must allow remote access, require multi-factor authentication and strong cryptography. ENSURE SERVICE PROVIDERS USE UNIQUE CREDENTIALS. Each one must use remote access credentials that are unique to your business and that are not the same ones used for other customers. ASK FOR HELP. Ask your vendor or service provider for help disabling remote access, or (if your vendor or service provider needs remote access) for help setting up multi-factor authentication. See Questions to ask your Vendors to help you know exactly what to ask them. HACKERS = THREATS One of the easiest ways for hackers to get into your system is through people you trust.

The PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) announced that it has launched its own PIN Listing Program. This Program brings an important security service listing to the community, representing another step in the Council’s mission to secure payments worldwide. The PCI PIN Listing is a resource for industry stakeholders to use in identifying and/or selecting providers of PIN services that have validated compliance with the PCI PIN Security Standard. The PIN Security Standard defines security requirements for the secure management, processing, and transmission of personal identification number (PIN) data during online and offline payment card transaction processing at ATMs and attended and unattended point-of-sale (POS) terminals. It is optional for PIN Service Providers to be included in this listing Program, but it helps merchants and other entities involved in payment processing to identify validated providers for PIN-related services. With the new Program, PIN Service Providers and Qualified PIN Assessors (QPAs) will benefit from a streamlined submission process: Centralized Submission Portal: All listing submissions will be submitted through the PCI SSC Portal. Standardized Review Process: Listing submissions will be evaluated by PCI SSC based on the PIN Attestation of Compliance (AOC), ensuring it meets all applicable requirements. Comprehensive Public Listing: Once accepted, PIN Service Providers will be published, for a fee, on the public directory on the PCI SSC website. PIN Service Provider Details: Listings will include information about the PIN Service Provider, PIN Standard version assessed against, the QPA Company that performed the PIN Assessment, and the validation/expiry date. Flexible PIN Listing Submission Process: QPA Companies or PIN Service Providers (with validated PIN AOCs) may submit a PIN Service Provider for listing on the PCI SSC website. PIN Service Providers can visit the PIN Listing page for the link to register for a Portal account; QPAs will have a link in their Portal account to submit an AOC on behalf of their PIN Service Provider customers. Promotional Pricing Through 2025: The Council is offering a promotional listing price through 31 December 2025. The standard fee will be effective as of 1 January 2026 (see the Program Fee Schedule on the website for details). Listings are valid for two years from the QPA signature date on the AOC, so PIN Service Providers are encouraged to plan submissions accordingly to get the maximum duration out of the listing fee. PCI SSC has updated the Qualified PIN Assessor (QPA) Program Guide to reflect the new processes and requirements. All current and prospective QPAs – as well as PIN Service Providers interested in being listed – are encouraged to review the updated Program Guide, available for download in the PCI SSC Document Library .

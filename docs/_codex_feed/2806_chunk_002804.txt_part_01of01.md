payment environments reside. Acquirer Considerations Each acquirer may have its own requirements related to engaging a TPSP. An entity may want to review its agreements with acquirers to ensure its TPSPs (or the acquirers’ TPSP(s)) are meeting any additional acquirer-specific responsibilities that flow through to TPSPs. Payment Card Brand Considerations Each payment card brand has created its own compliance programs. Entities seeking to engage TPSPs should consider reviewing these compliance-program requirements with the TPSP(s) in order to identify and appropriately allocate corresponding responsibilities, and to ensure that each understands and complies with all applicable payment card brand mandates. Industry-Specific Considerations In various industries and verticals there are specific industry regulations and requirements that entities might consider, as they may be important to the relationship and the allocation of rights and responsibilities between an entity and a TPSP. Specific issues to consider may include the handling of equipment that is part of the CDE, data-destruction requirements, and levels of protection required to meet compliance requirements. An entity and TPSP should discuss any industry-specific requirements that may be pertinent. Internal Policy-Specific (Subsidiary Relationships) Considerations In the event that a parent company and its subsidiary establish a relationship where one is a TPSP and the other is utilizing the TPSP services, additional issues to consider may include:  Is the TPSP incorporating subsidiaries into its PCI DSS assessment or performing separate PCI DSS assessments among those subsidiaries?  Is the TPSP considered a different level merchant/service provider than the entity? Does that affect the type of validation that either of them must perform? The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 23 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016  What does the TPSP actually provide to the entity?  What other aspects of the relationships may be relevant (e.g., independent franchisee vs. corporate franchisee)? Note: There is a high degree of variability in the formality of contractual arrangements between parent and subsidiary companies. Such arrangements range from unwritten agreements, to informal internal service-level agreements, to sophisticated arm’s length contracts. Nonetheless, the issues and concerns likely to arise between unrelated entities and TPSPs are also likely in the parent-subsidiary context. 5.3 Additional Considerations Entities seeking to engage TPSPs may also wish to consider the following. 5.3.1 Responsibility Matrix A responsibility matrix is typically a schedule or appendix that details specific responsibilities of the parties to an agreement, in an easy-to-understand, tabular format. A responsibility matrix in the entity– TPSP context may be useful in helping to identify a variety of issues, including but not limited to responsibilities, procedures, and notice periods for the following: Technology  Purchasing of system components  Building of system components  Testing/Deployment  Sustainment/maintenance (i.e., patching, vulnerability, and penetration testing)  Product or technology life cycle Processes  Operational procedures  Notification requirements  Superseding policy (in the event of a discrepancy, which policy will be considered valid)  Reporting  Audit procedures that include systems and facilities as required  PCI DSS validation activities  Access to systems/data for periodic validation if required (account reconciliation, logs, etc.)  Access to systems/data for forensic investigation  Data/evidence retention and destruction  Business recovery and continuity Furthermore, it may be appropriate (though not required by PCI DSS) to define the responsibilities on a per-requirement basis. See Appendix B for an example. The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 24 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 5.3.2 Data Breaches As outlined in PCI DSS Requirement 12.1010 regarding the incident response plan, numerous specific actions may be required in connection with suspected data breaches, within a very short time of such breach. Entities may wish to consider how best to ensure that the TPSP is aware of these requirements and develop a workflow establishing when, how, and who a TPSP must notify in case of a suspected data breach. In addition to the incident response plan required by PCI DSS, payment card brands and national or regional laws may require breach notification. Entities should consider each of these issues with relevant TPSPs, and how best to allocate responsibility for all applicable notification requirements and all requisite follow up actions. Entities are also strongly encouraged to include in their contract with TPSPs that in the event of a breach/compromise, the TPSP must participate fully with a PCI forensic investigator (PFI) and the forensics investigation, including making the entity’s data, systems, components, and related services available for investigation. Additional considerations may include issues such as:  Steps expected of entities and/or TPSPs if data loss has occurred  Use of tools such as file recovery  Applicability and adequacy of insurance coverage  Responsibility for making notifications  Financial responsibility for notification costs  Notification timelines  Engagement of forensic investigators and responsibility for investigation costs  Clearly documenting the incident (involving cardholder data) response reporting requirements, including who is responsible for notifying the acquirer or card brands in case of a third-party incident 5.3.3 Post-termination Considerations Regarding TPSPs and their Customers Entities that (a) are subject to requirements regarding CHD or any CDE (whether driven by the PCI DSS, legal considerations, or otherwise) and (b) outsource related responsibilities to a TPSP, may also wish to consider

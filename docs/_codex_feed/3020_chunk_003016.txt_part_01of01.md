against postal system databases or validating phone numbers through text or voice confirmation. Prohibited Data Blocking specific cardholder name, credit card BINs, card types, e-mail domains, phone numbers, addresses, etc. may be useful for merchants that need to block transactions manually based on known customer characteristics or history of abuse. PSPs may also offer access to databases with known abuse data. Other Proprietary Filters Some fraud detection may occur based on algorithms or heuristic transaction evaluation that is based on proprietary methods. While the approach itself may not be disclosed to the merchant, these services can vary in their effectiveness at identifying fraud.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 30 PSPs should also implement multiple transaction security and fraud controls to provide merchants with options to configure and respond to suspicious activity: Additional Unusual Activity Detection Options Action Type Description Scoring Many of the tests above cannot be acted on alone, as they may do not constitute a clear indication fraud or security compromise. In addition, excessive false positive alerts tend to lead to monitoring complacency. Scoring systems generally assign risk to each marker or transaction and raise alerts or take automated action only when a designated threshold is met within a single transaction, or between multiple transactions. Alert An e-mail alert or other notification may be sent to the merchant for any transaction that fails one or more tests, allowing for human review or verification of the transaction and prompt escalation for fraud or security incident response. Reject It is recommended merchants reject transactions that are clearly fraudulent or exceed merchant risk tolerance; however, legitimate sales could also be rejected. Rejections should always be accompanied by alerts or reporting to ensure spikes in rejected transactions over time are cause for review. These services are not required for PCI DSS compliance, but complement any e-commerce merchant’s security program and should be considered as a part of the merchant’s risk analysis and incident response plan. 2.11.3 Tokenization Tokenization at a high level allows businesses to avoid having to access or store CHD. Tokenization allows for the replacement of the payment card number with a token (referred to as an acquiring token— for more information see FAQ 1384) that may be used post-authorization but only by the merchant to whom the token is issued. If a merchant’s environment were breached, the tokens would be useless for purchases at any other merchant, CP or CNP; hence, there is no incentive for criminals to steal tokens. Keep in mind that the initiation of a transaction begins with actual CHD, which is still transmitted along a secure network to the tokenization provider’s secure vault. Subsequently, a token is then derived and sent to the merchant who can then use the token internally without concern of having CHD transmitted throughout its network. Depending on the service provider offering, merchants may or may not be provided with encryption “keys” which would allow them to request access to the sensitive information stored within the provider’s vault if a business need were to arise. Processes and systems used by the merchant to handle that de-tokenized payment card data would then be subject to PCI DSS requirements. This is something to consider in the event of addressing a chargeback. Typically, the final four digits of a card number are sufficient for managing chargebacks and refunds. Merchants still face some challenges. Regardless, potential solutions exist that may help even though the merchants receive payments originating from various card brands and organizations.

Encryption of CHD does not remove it from scope of the PCI DSS. Merchants must carefully consider the capabilities of the e-commerce solution to ensure that strong cryptography is used to secure CHD. This includes data in transit and in storage (even temporarily) and must be able to maintain and monitor the security of encrypted CHD in accordance to PCI DSS. Encrypted Transmission Per PCI DSS Requirement 4.1, cardholder data must be encrypted across open, public networks. Businesses must question potential SPs with respect to their adherence to this PCI DSS requirement. As noted further in PCI DSS Appendix A2 regarding SSL, “all service providers must provide a secure service offering”—this includes acquirers, processors, and gateways as well. If a service provider is not able to verify that a merchant has indeed adhered to this mandate and is not able to supply a remediation plan to support its activities towards meeting this requirement, the merchant should consider selecting a different SP. It is also recommended that merchants ensure their systems are using a secure protocol and, if applicable, the service provider can support that protocol. Encrypted Storage Many merchants who opt to utilize an e-commerce solution may not consider the potential for the e- commerce solution to store CHD in some manner. Even if the merchant has received a fully outsourced e-commerce solution, unless specifically noted as a service option, the merchant should ask the potential

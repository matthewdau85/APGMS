AusPayNet is the industry association and self-regulatory body for Australian payments. AusPayNet manages and develops regulations, procedures, policies and standards governing payments clearing and settlement within Australia. Perspective Hive (www.perspectivehive.com.au) is a consulting hub of expertise offering services and programs to help organisations across a wide range of industries create diverse and inclusive workplace practices and cultures. Convenient and secure payments for all Innovation in payment technologies including the use of touchscreens has provided many benefits for retailers, merchants and customers. However, with these new technologies comes the need to ensure inclusion and accessibility for all users. At AusPayNet, our vision is convenient and secure payments for all. Realising that vision means ensuring that as payment solutions become more convenient, they also remain inclusive and accessible. To safeguard that, we’ve undertaken an extensive consultation process with people living with vision and / or motor impairments, representative bodies for the disability community, their networks and their supporters. The community has identified that the ability to enter PINs securely and independently on touchscreen Point-of-Sale (POS) devices, also referred to as “PIN on glass”, is an area where accessibility and inclusiveness can be challenging in making independent financial transactions. This is specifically the case when using a touchscreen-only POS device and entering a PIN without assistance or compromising personal security. Our intent during the consultation was to understand the impact of any barriers that exist for the community who live with disability in making payments using touchscreen technology. We were also keen to explore potential ways in which those barriers could be overcome. A wide range of solutions and ideas were shared with us. Many have been included in this document, combined with input from organisations involved in banking and payments, and learnings drawn from international research. We have developed the Guidelines to raise awareness and understanding of designing for inclusion and accessibility. The Guidelines aim to ensure that future innovations in payment technologies and platforms using touchscreens are consistently approached from that foundation. These Guidelines align with the Australian Banking Association’s (ABA’s) ‘Every Customer Counts – Accessibility Principles for Banking Services’ and other relevant frameworks including the Principles of Universal Design. Consistency across payment devices was a key theme in the feedback emerging from our consultation, as was a preference from the community for payment devices for keypads with physically distinct keys, and a raised dot on the number five (referred to as a ‘tactile keypad’). We recognise that preference while also noting the importance of the Guidelines and supplementary information, which focus on creating a foundation for the inclusive design of future touch screen terminals, especially given the remainder of the consultation feedback and the benefits of such touchscreen technology to retailers, merchants and customers. On behalf of AusPayNet, I thank everyone involved in the consultation process and for their generous input and feedback. I also encourage everyone in the payments industry to actively consider the Guidelines when developing touchscreen technologies in future, to create solutions that are accessible to all. Andy White CEO, Australian Payments Network 4 Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals Our Commitment Introduction 1 Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals 6 ➜ Objective This document has been created to assist the payments community in the design and procurement of Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals using touchscreen technology for PIN entry, with the objective of improving the accessibility of these devices for people with vision and/or motor impairments. The Guidelines for PIN on glass (set out in Section 2) are a starting point for AusPayNet’s ongoing work in the area of enhancing accessibility in payments. AusPayNet supports the sentiments expressed in the 2019 Australian Payments Council (APC) Strategic Agenda, and specifically the requirement to improve accessibility and will continue to work with members to develop useability guidelines for payment product and service design more broadly. ➜ Scope of Guidelines The Guidelines set out in Section 2 specifically apply to the design

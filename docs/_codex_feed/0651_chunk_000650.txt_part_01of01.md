We work with our members and other payments industry stakeholders to identify and manage security risks in payment systems and payment technologies. AusPayNet supports payments technology innovation that meets Australian security requirements and that preserves consumers’ confidence and trust in the payments system. Mobile banking and payment services, mobile / digital wallets and third party digital wallets are emerging features of the global and Australian payments landscape that potentially offer significant consumer benefits. Digital or mobile wallets are software applications on consumer devices which act as a repository for payment and other cards, and which by provisioning encrypted payment card data, effectively enable ‘card present’ mobile payment transactions at POS and in application. Third Party Digital Wallets are those which may be provided by a third party using multiple Card Issuers’ payment Card data, customer relationships and existing payment networks, as well as various intermediaries and service providers. Australians are well-served by a robust consumer protection framework for mobile banking and mobile payment services - the ePayments Code – which attributes primary liability for unauthorised transactions made by use of such facilities to the Card Issuer subscriber which has promoted or endorsed that facility, even where the liability might be attributable to another party in the shared network. These Guidelines have been issued by AusPayNet as industry best-practice to help Card Issuer members of the IAC to understand and proactively manage potential fraud and security risks in the provision of Third Party Digital Wallet services. They are voluntary. As an adjunct to the Guidelines, AusPayNet will periodically convene open mobile payments industry fora, develop publications and white papers and invite consultation to promote understanding of, and consider developments in, mobile payments security and fraud management issues. D.1.2 SCOPE The Guidelines focus on the issues which typically require consideration by a Card Issuer in the context of provisioning its Cards to third party mobile wallets, 84 Amended effective 21/11/16, version 004 r&p 002.16 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS REQUIREMENTS ANNEXURE C DEBIT CARD FRAUD PREVENTION GUIDELINES Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 36 including customer identification and verification, authentication of transactions and management of token generation and Card data security. These Guidelines are not intended to address the issues of liability apportionment between Cardholders, Card Issuers, Digital Wallet Providers and other parties to a Third Party Digital Wallet transaction: this is a proprietary matter for parties to resolve. The Guidelines do not apply to software applications that process payments solely using card-on-file data provided directly by a Cardholder to the payment service provider, where ‘card-not-present’ liability arrangements apply. The Guidelines have not been drafted to apply to Card Issuers’ proprietary mobile banking applications or proprietary wallet services, being those provided by a Card Issuer solely for its own customers. The responsibility for managing fraud and security of proprietary wallet services, and the liability for, and reputational risk associated with, losses resulting from use of proprietary products, rests entirely with

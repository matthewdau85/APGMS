recordings and permit access only for the reason retrieved. Ensure recordings are securely deleted or destroyed when no longer needed. Note that rendering SAD non-queryable could be assimilated to a compensating control. This would therefore need to be documented as required by PCI DSS.

It is implemented using protocols based on open standards or proprietary protocols. E.1 Protocols, Ports and Network. VoIP is generally implemented using two main protocols: H.323 and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Vendors using “unified communications” can include further protocols due to video (telepresence) and instant- messaging (IM) capabilities. Some examples of other protocols are: Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP), H.248, Skype protocol (proprietary), Jingle. H.323 and SIP each use two separate data streams, one for the signaling and one for the media (this can be voice data). The signaling stream will utilize well-known ports, often over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The media stream can tolerate the loss of some packets; it uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP) transport layer which is dynamic in nature. This means that traffic-filtering devices need to be configured to allow a much greater range of ports to allow the traffic to pass correctly. Implementing Network Address Translation (NAT) can add to these complications because the devices may not necessarily know where to send traffic that is seen. Finally, the use of UDP may render the detection of malicious content or payload more difficult. Firewalls and network devices should be VoIP-aware so they are capable of monitoring the VoIP traffic and dynamically open the necessary ports and network translations to facilitate the traffic. This means that firewalls can still be secure, maintaining the state of the traffic by only opening ports when required for the voice call. E.2 VoIP Attacks and Vulnerabilities VoIP equipment and software are susceptible to vulnerabilities that could allow someone with malicious intent to gain access to your network, intercept and gather customer data, or initiate a denial-of-service attack. It is important that these devices and software are included in the vulnerability-management process with, in particular: monitoring vulnerabilities, internal and external vulnerability scanning and patching. In addition to vulnerability management, the configuration of VoIP devices and software must be secure, including, but not limited to disabling unnecessary services and accounts, changing default passwords, and implementing a strong password policy. Securing remote access, whether Internet or shell access, is paramount and must be done in accordance with PCI DSS.

For example, however, many consumer VoIP devices do not support encryption of the signaling or the media streams. We have already mentioned that successfully implementing secure protocols across several telecom carrier may present some challenges. A lack of encryption may result in eavesdropping on VoIP calls when access to the data network is possible. Packet analyzers such as, for example, Wireshark or tcpdump, make capturing VoIP conversations and data trivial. E.4 Unified Communications The concept of unified communications begins to integrate communication features of voice/video communications. It is not unusual for vendors to tightly integrate instant messaging, video or telepresence, telephony, facsimile, electronic mail and other communication services into clusters of servers that are not easily segmented or isolated from one another. As a result, entities can find that their only option to minimize the PCI scope of their VoIP environment is to implement multiple instances of in-scope VoIP and out-of-scope VoIP.

F.2 SIP Redirection When a service provider is used by the entity to process payments, it is important to review how the service is implemented as it can impact the PCI DSS scope. In the following examples, the entity uses a service provider that will capture the cardholder data via an IVR system or DTMF capture, or any other technology, and process the payment on behalf of the entity. All the data the entity should receive is a truncated version of the PAN or a tokenized PAN with the transaction data and an acknowledgement of the transaction result. The service provider location and the account data flow must be understood. These examples are provided to highlight that SIP redirection does not necessarily completely remove the entity’s infrastructure from PCI DSS scope. In the Diagram F1 below, the service provider is situated close to the carrier network and the account data will be “intercepted” before it

Australian Payments Plus (AP+ for short) is pleased to announce that Tap to Pay on iPhone will work with the eftpos payment system in Australia, offering merchants payment choice. From today, with Tap to Pay on iPhone, eftpos will be accepted as a contactless payment network, using only an iPhone and a supporting iOS app from eligible payment platforms. With Tap to Pay on iPhone, merchants can seamlessly and securely accept contactless payments using only an iPhone and a supporting iOS app — with no additional hardware needed. Tap to Pay on iPhone uses the built-in features of iPhone to keep the business’ and customers’ data private and secure. When a payment is processed, Apple doesn’t store card numbers on the device or on Apple servers. Merchants can now choose the most cost-effective way of routing Tap to Pay on iPhone payments via dual network debit cards with eftpos. "Providing merchants the option to accept a contactless payment with eftpos using Tap to Pay on iPhone continues our drive to ensure Australians have payment choice,” says AP+ Chief Payments and Schemes Officer, Adrian Lovney. eftpos has been at the forefront of payment systems in Australia since 1984, delivering innovations like contactless chip payments in 2014 and expanding to mobile payments in 2017.

or in an update lodgment. Each Employee Payroll Event messages in error is referenced in the response using the Record Delimiter Partial File Rejection – Main points to note UNCLASSIFIED – PAYEVNT Technical interactions - Clarification on Partial File Rejection, SLA, File Size, Recovery Strategy Single Touch Payroll Technical Committee (STPTC@ato.gov.au) 6th December 2017 7 • Count of Transactions may not match: As this change means the ATO may now partially reject erroneous Employee Payroll Event messages, the count of the transactions in the original submission file may not match what is ultimately accepted. • Technical Receipts: Once DSP have received a technical receipt for payroll lodgment they should expect ATO will process that lodgment regardless of any subsequent transient unavailability. o The ATO is further investing in the SBR 2 solution to eliminate data loss even in a disaster recovery scenario. Currently, inflight transactions are not replicated across data centres, so are at risk of loss. This is still work in progress. o The Technical receipt is returned immediately after delivery of message, minimal backend processing should get in the way of delivering this technical receipt. o If DSP doesn’t receive a technical receipt immediately after delivering the message, they should assume the delivery failed. • Retention of Receipt messages: In addition to getting Recovery Point Objective to zero, ATO is also making further investment in SBR 2 to make it highly available. Sadly, in our human realm, perfection is never achieved. So DSPs should be prepared for failure in lodging. This might be because of an ATO planned or unplanned (hopefully not) unavailability. Similarly, it might be because the failure is between the DSP & ATO. Therefore DSPs should have ability to “re-do” lodgments once issues are addressed. o It is not possible for the ATO to say how long DSPs may need to retain their messages before being able to perform a lodgment. The ATO is aiming for high availability (> 99.95%). So it is left to DSPs to assess how long they might need retain messages to re- send to deal with ATO unavailability. o Ideally, once a technical receipt has been received, DSPs shouldn’t have to retain the message any longer (record keeping obligations aside). DSPs with experience in dealing with the ATO recant experiences of supplying files 6 months later. • Parent/Child Structure to remain: ATO has considered whether, due to this change, it would be prudent to change away from the Parent/ Child structure for the Payroll Event. The impact of that change would be too significant, both for the ATO and DSPs and so the ATO will not be pursuing that change. • Matching failures result in messages being posted against the employer record. Matching failures for TFND content generates correspondence to the employer. Once resolved will be transferred to employee. Currently no process exists to resolve payroll event matching failures. Currently this data is not viewable by employer or employees. SLA up to 72 hour– Main points to note UNCLASSIFIED – PAYEVNT Technical interactions - Clarification on Partial File Rejection, SLA, File Size, Recovery Strategy Single Touch Payroll Technical Committee (STPTC@ato.gov.au) 6th December 2017 8 • ATO anticipates the channel validation results should be ready to be pulled long before the 72 hours has elapsed. o If current performance tests are to be believed, the channel validation for even the largest lodgment will be ready within a couple of hours. • Currently the Common MIG currently prescribes that DSPs should only attempt to poll for responses after 1 hour 10 seconds + 10 seconds/lodgment. For a 200K employee file this equates to. 2,003,600 seconds or roughly 23 days. This guidance pre-dates STP volumes and the partial file rejection change (which includes responding before processing Employee Payroll Event messages through the backend). o The ATO will update the Common MIG to put special provisions in for STP. These provision will say response messages may be polled at the following frequency (after receiving the technical receipt). • The goal will be that at least 50% of the time the response will be available on the first poll. Given ATO is publishing these figures now, but ATO will not see how the system behaves under real load until post production, achieving this goal will require a degree of good luck. • It is anticipated that in time the above polling times will be applied to other types of lodgments. • ATO is giving consideration as to how it will enforce the above polling rate to prevent overuse by DSPs. • Once a technical receipt has been received ATO SLA indicates the payroll event lodgment will be processed within 72 hours. o That is, no longer than after 72 hours (usually a lot shorter), employees should be able see payment summary on ATO Online. o After 72 hours DSPs should give up polling for a response and contact the ATO Number of Employees Initial Polling Subsequent Polling Fully Processed Less than 100 1 Mins After another 1 Minutes, and then every 5 Minutes 72 hrs 101-200 2 Mins After another 2 mins, then every 10 mins 201-1000 10 Mins After a further 10 mins, then every 20 mins 1000 & up 1 hour After a further 30 mins, then every hour File size management – Main points to note UNCLASSIFIED – PAYEVNT Technical interactions - Clarification on Partial File Rejection, SLA, File Size, Recovery Strategy Single Touch

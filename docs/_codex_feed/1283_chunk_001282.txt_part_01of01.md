Modernisation of Tax Administration Systems (MTAS) – Phase Two Project overview The Modernisation of Tax Administration Systems (MTAS) Program is an ATO wide strategy aimed at improving the integrity of the tax system by working with Digital Service Providers (DSPs) and improving ATO internal systems. It will deliver enhanced processes that increase the quality of the data being collected in relation to trustees and beneficiaries and will support the ATO to better utilise the information which drives our compliance activities. In addition, MTAS will deliver sustained improvements to the tax performance with respect to trusts and beneficiaries through facilitating improved lodgment rates and lodgment accuracy leading to increased willing participation in the tax system and improve efficiency in the way the ATO administers and processes trust reporting obligations. It will also address technical disparities between the ATO and external software providers who process trust income tax data which will in turn assist the ATO accommodate future technological changes going forward. Currently in scope MTAS Core Services – delivery planned in Tax Time 2026 and 2027 Core Capability 1: Restructure and modification of Trust Tax Return (TRT) - further data validations, new interactive validation, and the automation of the trustee assessment process Stage 1: Prefill beneficiary trust income into Individual Income Tax Returns (IITRs). Increased data validation through digital channels to prevent bad data from being sent to ATO and reduce manual error correction. Capability 2: Prefill trust income data for individual beneficiaries Stage 2: New labels added to the TRT to increase transparency and visibility of data. Allow lodgers to send TRT’s holding more than 200 beneficiaries through existing Standard Business Reporting (SBR2) channel. MTAS Enhancements Project – delivery expected in Tax Time 2027 Capability 3: Prefill trust income data and nudge messaging for non-individual beneficiaries Expand the prefill offering at the ATO to non-individual beneficiaries. This entails development of a new non-individual prefill service by the ATO in consultation with DSPs on design and implementation. Capability 4: Online self-service lodgment function for self-preparing TRT’s Deliver a new retail service offering by the ATO to reduce paper lodgments and will be eased through the existing Online Services for Business (OSB) platform. This online self-service lodgement mechanism provides functionality for non-individuals consistent with the current retail solution for individual taxpayers (myTax). Key Dates Expected to be delivered in time for implementation at Tax Time 2026 and 2027.

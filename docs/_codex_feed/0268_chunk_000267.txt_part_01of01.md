Our 2021 Payment Fraud Report reveals that in 2020, with the onset of COVID-19, overall spending on Australian payment cards fell for the first time - dropping 2.2% to $801.7 billion – while card fraud rose by 0.6% to $467.6 million. Accordingly, the card fraud rate was 58.3 cents per $1,000 spent, which was slightly higher than 57.6 cents in 2019 but well below the 73.0 cents per $1,000 spent in 2018. Counterfeit / Skimming fraud fell 34.1% to $11.1 million Fraud on Lost and Stolen cards fell by 24.9% to $26.3 million Card-Not-Present (CNP) fraud increased by 3.8% to $418.9 million The NAB Online Retail Sales Index estimates that online retail spending grew by 44% in 2020. As face-to-face transactions decreased during the pandemic and online shopping continued to accelerate, there was an uptick in CNP fraud. AusPayNet’s report also indicates that as measures to counter card fraud take effect, criminal groups are turning their attention to making money from scams. The ACCC reports that Australians lost $851 million to scams in 2020, up 34% on 2019. This year, AusPayNet has established the Economic Crime Forum, which will bring together a broad set of participants to coordinate a joint response to all economic crime - scams, fraud, financial crime, and banking-related cyber incidents - and share intelligence on emerging threats.

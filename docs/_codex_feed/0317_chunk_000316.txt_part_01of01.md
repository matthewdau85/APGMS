Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Technical Specifications Version 3.3.2 September 2017 MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 2 AusPayNet September 2017 Preface Amended, effective 19/05/08 This publication has been prepared for Australian Payments Network Limited. (AusPayNet) by APCS Framework Participants in conjunction with the Security Printers’ Association and Xplor Asia Pacific for the use of APCS Framework Participants, printers and equipment suppliers involved in the production or processing of MICR encoded documents. The publication is available on the AusPayNet website. AusPayNet Publication “Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Technical Specifications” replaces the specifications contained in Australian Banks’ Payment Systems Operations Committee Publication 3-R2 (1988) and its supplements, “Non-Impact MICR Encoding Standards” (1993) and “Accreditation of MICR Printing Systems” (1997), and all previous versions of these specifications. This publication includes the specifications for the E-13B font, the construction and positioning of MICR code lines, methods of printing and quality assurance procedures. Details of design rules and approval procedures for cheques and deposit forms are contained in AusPayNet Publication Design Specifications for Cheque and Deposit Forms. The Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms particularly contains details of the requirements for colours to accommodate Image Capture technology and enhanced security features needed to combat fraudulent alteration or reproduction of cheques. Specifications for paper that is to be used for producing cheques and deposit forms are contained in section 6 of this publication. These specifications replace Australian Standard AS2277 – 1994, “Paper for MICR Encoded Documents”. The mention of specific manufacturers of equipment with or without model numbers or descriptive names does not in any way imply endorsement of the product(s) or confirmation of its performance by AusPayNet. A Register of Accredited MICR Printing Systems is maintained by AusPayNet and lists MICR Printing Systems that have been submitted to AusPayNet for testing and found at the time of testing to have met the requirements set out in Appendix 3 of this publication. In accordance with ISO practice, the word "must" indicate a mandatory requirement, and "may" or "should" indicates a preferred requirement. The word “document” is used to describe any MICR encoded form, including cheque and deposit forms. These specifications apply to any document intended for use in the Australian Paper Clearing System (APCS). Words defined in the APCS Regulations and Procedures have, unless the contrary intention appears, the same meaning in this publication. Document amended on September 2017 for the re-branding of APCA to AusPaynet.

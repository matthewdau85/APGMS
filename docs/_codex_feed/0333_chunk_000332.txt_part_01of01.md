image. The data in the MICR line is still captured magnetically and stored with the image data ready for further electronic processing. The main tasks of the operator are to load the machine and interpret any amounts that the software cannot read with confidence. 5.2.2 High Speed Reader/Sorters These machines are capable of processing over 1,500 six-inch documents per minute and are typically used in the processing centers of large Financial Institutions. Those in current use are the IBM 3890 series and the Unisys DP1800 series; plus the BancTec models 5500 and 5300 that are slightly slower speed machines. These machines are typified by the large number of pockets that are used for sorting and several passes are made to initially capture data and then to sort documents into the required order for exchange and storage. The large number of passes used for this processing are the reason for many of the specifications relating to paper and print quality. With a trend to electronic interchanges and Image Capture of documents, the number of passes through these machines will reduce. 5.2.3 Image Machines Imaging capabilities can be added to many existing reader/sorters as an added function but in many cases, older equipment is being replaced with fully functional new processing equipment. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 39 AusPayNet September 2017 The document is illuminated with a powerful light source and the image of both sides can be recorded with a digital camera. The image may be captured at 256 grey-levels and stored in a number of formats, depending on the use to be made of the image. For simple retention of the critical information, a high-contrast compressed image will retain sufficient data for ICR. The ICR process can interpret to a high degree of reliability the written or printed value of the amount of a document. If confirmation of difficult to interpret characters is required, the image can be displayed on a screen for operator intervention. This is the initial purpose of most Image installations. Exchange of data on transactions is increasingly being carried out electronically and the exchange of paper documents being mainly for storage. Further progress is dependent on the acceptance of the use of electronic images in business and for record retention purposes. This will allow processing, exchange and retention to be electronically based. For such purposes, better quality images will be retained and the size of the file will become critical. Financial Institutions will thus place greater emphasis on document design that is aimed at minimising the size of the file of the document’s image. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 40 AusPayNet September 2017 6 Paper for MICR encoded documents Paper used to produce MICR encoded documents shall conform to the following specifications. These specifications supersede AS 2277 – 1994 (Australian Standard – Paper for MICR Encoded Documents). Manufacturers and suppliers of such paper may apply to have their product(s) listed on the AusPayNet Paper Register in the manner described below. This will enable AusPayNet to advise APCS Framework Participants, Printers and other interested bodies of papers that conform to these specifications. Samples tested for the AusPayNet Paper Register shall be conditioned according to AS 1301, P414m and samples taken according to AS 1301,P417s. This specification includes details of security features as described in section 6 of this Publication. 6.1 AusPayNet Paper Register The AusPayNet Paper Register lists paper grades that conform to this specification. Manufacturers and suppliers who wish to have their product(s) listed on the AusPayNet Paper Register should contact AusPayNet for the application form. The application form will request details of the paper’s properties in reference to the specifications and test methods outlined below. Details of the laboratory test results would need to be supplied showing the numeric values and normal range that is achieved in the manufacture of the paper grade specified. In addition, where the paper is watermarked, sensitised or special inclusions are used for security purposes, samples of the typical product shall be provided as required by the application form. The application shall be reviewed by AusPayNet and, if the paper meets the specifications, the paper shall be placed on the AusPayNet Paper Register. Once on the AusPayNet Paper Register, the paper shall be reviewed annually. AusPayNet shall contact the applicant to provide updated information. The information shall be reviewed in the same manner as a new application. If information is not provided within a reasonable time, the paper grade shall be removed from the AusPayNet Paper Register. 6.2 General properties 6.2.1 Surface The surface shall be smooth with no major irregularities and free of dust, lint or dirt. The paper shall be sized to facilitate rapid ink drying. 6.2.2 Constitution The fibre finish shall be 100% chemical bleached fibre. The filler shall be chemically neutral and non-abrasive. No magnetisable particles are permitted to be present, as MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 41 AusPayNet September 2017 these will interfere with the MICR readings. 6.2.3 Coatings Other than for carbonless coatings, where special conditions apply, any coatings should not adversely affect the writing and printing quality of the paper, and must be free of abrasive materials. Special coatings that, for example enhance drying of MICR ink or improve toner adhesion, are permitted as long as they conform to these specifications. 6.2.4 Permanent Paper Paper should conform to Standards for

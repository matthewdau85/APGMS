of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 19 4 Process PCI DSS specifically addresses physically securing all media. In the context of securing telephone payments in all telephone environments, processes should be implemented and managed to reduce opportunities for fraud of all personnel exposed to account data. PCI DSS also makes clear that even if encryption technologies are in place, an entity should not store sensitive authentication data after authorization. For all telephone environments, sensitive authentication data (SAD) includes the card security code/value that may be taken during a telephone call. The only entities that can store SAD after authorization or for other purposes are issuers and companies supporting issuing services with a business need to retain the data. These entities are required to protect the data in accordance with PCI DSS Requirement 3.2. If SAD is received and recorded, the entity MUST render all data unrecoverable upon completion of the authorization process. Implementing a process to prevent the recording of sensitive authentication data may be considered a best practice. This applies irrespective of the complexity of an entity’s telephone environment. If any part of the telephone environment is outsourced to a third-party service provider, both the entity and service provider should clearly understand their responsibilities for securing their respective systems, processes, and personnel, and document accordingly. PCI DSS Requirement 12.8 mandates policies and procedures to manage service providers. 4.1 Risks and Guidance in Simple Telephone Environments In simple telephone environments where technology is not deployed to prevent spoken account data from being listened to by personnel and calls are not intentionally recorded, restricting the recording of account data is essential to maintain a secure environment. This may mean implementing processes to restrict access to: notebooks and pens, mobile phones capable of taking notes, any device that enables voice recordings, andwhere account data is input into a systemany device capable of taking pictures. Processes should also be put in place to prevent the use of other transportable technology devices where account data is processed through systemse.g., memory sticks, Bluetooth recorders, and/or key loggers. These processes are not explicitly required by PCI DSS but can be implemented as part of the entity’s security policy to fulfil the requirement to protect payment card data. In all cases where calls may be intentionally recorded, entities should ensure that sensitive authentication data is not stored after authorization, as made clear in the foregoing paragraphs. 4.2 Additional Risks and Guidance in Complex Telephone Environments Without appropriate segmentation, the convergence of voice and data networks can have the effect of bringing entity’s wider infrastructure into PCI DSS scope. The implementation and monitoring of all the processes detailed within the PCI DSS will therefore apply and ideally be part of the entity’s security policy identified in Requirement 12.1. Mitigating the risks associated with spoken account data focuses on Information Supplement • Protecting Telephone-Based Payment Card Data • November 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 20 minimizing the opportunities of account data being recorded by personnel in written or electronic format, typically by denying access to materials and devices capable of recording account data. To prevent unauthorized access by individuals with any malicious intention, policies and procedures should be defined to ensure that all personnelincluding onsite employees, home workers, and remote agentsare aware that any unauthorized copying, moving, sharing, or storing of payment card data is prohibited. Additionally, the physical environment within which an office worker or home worker is taking card payments over the telephone should be effectively monitored and access controlled. Examples of required controls include:  Ensure that at-home/remote workers use a multi-factor authentication process when connecting to the telephone environment or to any systems that process account data.  Restrict physical access to media containing payment card data, such as call or screen recordings, as well as networking/communications hardware.  Ensure only authorized personnel are allowed in business areas where telephony equipment and agent desktops are located. For company premises, this includes implementing procedures to clearly identify visitors and make sure all visitors are escorted when in the telephone environment. Securing systems and data located in home-worker environments can be challenging and difficult to enforce. At a minimum, home workers should be required to ensure that any systems they use to process account data, and any account data to which they have access, is securely maintained and not accessible to any unauthorized individual.  Provide awareness training annually for all personnel to understand the importance of physical security and keeping the workspace secure—for example, not to write passwords on sticky notes attached to the desktop—and define clear responsibilities for remote agents regarding physical security of all telephone equipment in their homes or remote locations.  If account data is ever written or printed on paper, ensure it is securely stored, then shredded when no longer needed. If any part of the telephone environment is outsourced to a third-party service provider, both the entity and service provider should clearly understand their responsibilities for securing their respective systems, processes, and personnel, and document accordingly. Where account data is input into systems:  Ensure and verify that the PAN is masked when displayed (the first six and last four digits are the maximum number of

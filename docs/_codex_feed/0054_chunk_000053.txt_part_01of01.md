Pillar 1: Collaborate with the industry AusPayNet is collaborating with industry participants and regulators on their initiatives to facilitate the transition away from the BECS Framework. An update on these initiatives is provided in the table below: # Initiative Update 1 RBA’s Risk Assessment into the proposed decommissioning of BECS AusPayNet and AP+ continue to work collaboratively on addressing the 20 recommendations identified in the RBA’s Risk Assessment report into the proposed decommissioning of BECS released on 11 March 2025. Public account-to-account (A2A) payments vision consultation On 2 July 2025, AusPayNet and AP+ launched a joint public consultation , supported by the RBA and Treasury, to capture stakeholders’ views on the current and future payment needs and expectations of Australia’s A2A payments systems. The public consultation received 68 responses from a broad range of stakeholders. AusPayNet and AP+ are currently reviewing these submissions. The aggregated and anonymised consultation findings will be publicly shared in October 2025 and are an important input to the A2A Payments Roundtable (Roundtable) process that commenced on 5 September 2025. The Roundtable is a series of meetings being held between AusPayNet, AP+, the RBA and Commonwealth Treasury. These meetings will help shape a shared vision for the future of A2A payments in Australia and define high-level deliverables and milestones for achieving that vision, including clear prioritisation and sequencing. BECS options analysis In parallel to the development of the A2A payments vision, AusPayNet is progressing its assessment of a comprehensive set of options for BECS that might be relevant to achieving the A2A vision. This assessment considers the options for BECS against a set of dimensions that include end-user readiness, viability, resilience, contingency, economics, trust and sovereignty. 2 AP+'s Move to NPP Program For the latest updates on AP+'s program, please visit AP+'s Move to NPP Program updates . AusPayNet continues to attend AP+'s Move to NPP Steering Committee meetings as an Observer. 3 RBA's A2A Payment Pricing Study The RBA is continuing its study of account-to-account payments in Australia, following the initial data collection circulated in September 2024. AusPayNet will be submitting data to the RBA for the financial year 2024-2025. Pillar 2: Control the future of the framework AusPayNet continues to monitor industry’s progress on the transition to modern alternatives and the validity of the 2030 target end date. BECS Members views on the future of BECS, and Industry’s A2A payments vision development and assessment of options to support the future state of A2A payments are important considerations. AusPayNet is aiming to provide clarity to the industry on the 2030 target end date by the end of this year. Pillar 3: Coordinate the migration On 1 August 2025, the ACCC granted authorisation (with conditions) to collaborate about the future of A2A payments infrastructure in Australia. This authorisation paved the way for the A2A Payments Roundtable process to commence. The first Roundtable meeting was held on 5 September 2025, with subsequent meetings expected to follow every four to six weeks over the next six months. A summary of the discussions held at the first Roundtable meeting is provided in the Roundtable Update . The first meeting of the Payments Review Committee Sponsored Member Workshop (PSMW), comprising 13 entities representing Tier 1 and Tier 2 BECS Members and the RBA’s Payments Settlements Department, was held on 22 August 2025 to capture member views on the Roundtable agenda topics. The next PSMW will be held on 30 September, in preparation for the second Roundtable to be held on 16 October 2025. Pillar 4: Consider end-user perspectives The RBA’s Risk Assessment highlighted the importance of end-user engagement and AusPayNet’s Board continues to discuss AusPayNet’s role in this to ensure that end-user perspectives are appropriately considered throughout the BECS Transition. Although AusPayNet’s primary channel remains our BECS Members who engage with their customers, the public A2A payments vision consultation has enabled a broad range of stakeholders and users to input into the future of Australia’s A2A payments system. AusPayNet expects further opportunities for end-user perspectives to be captured and considered during the Roundtable process as the A2A payments vision is developed. AusPayNet continues to have direct engagement with AusPayNet’s Stakeholder Advisory Council (ASAC), which meets quarterly and has representatives from government and end-user interest groups. Pillar 5: Communicate with members and stakeholders AusPayNet is working with AP+ on the appropriate engagement approach for common members (i.e. BECS Members who are also participants of NPP) to avoid duplication in information gathering and communication. Any joint engagement will be subject to the ACCC authorisation conditions. AusPayNet continues to meet bilaterally with our members as part of our ongoing member engagement, and regularly engages with the RBA, Treasury and providers of modern alternatives to BECS. A post-Board BECS Member online briefing is held, approximately every two months, accompanied by updates to AusPayNet’s BECS Transition webpage . The next update on the BECS Transition Program will be published in November 2025.

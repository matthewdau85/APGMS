Contributions by “new joiners” to NPP initial build costs “New joiner” contributions will continue to apply for Participants, who want to directly connect to the NPP infrastructure. These new joiner costs, reducing each year until 2028, are directly referable to costs incurred by NPP Participants in building the NPP from 2013. These costs entitle eligible organisations to physical equipment, a set of governance rights and obligations for NPP and access to NPP wholesale pricing for ongoing operational costs.

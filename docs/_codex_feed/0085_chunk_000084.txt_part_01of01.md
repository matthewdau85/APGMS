CEO’s Corner A New Year; Consultation Season As I highlighted in the last Payments Monitor , the end of 2023 and start of 2024 was not so much a festive season as a consultation season, as we engaged with our Members on, and responded to, three major Government consultations: on payments licensing, cheques, and scams. The second consultation on payments licensing built on its predecessor by setting out proposals for: an updated list of payment functions that would require a licence, the regulatory oversight and licensing obligations that would apply to those functions a framework for the setting of mandatory technical industry standards. Our submission highlighted the following key points: The proposed regulatory framework broadly aligns with the principle of ‘similar activity, similar risks, same regulatory outcome’. Members continue to have concerns around the clarity and breadth of some of the proposed functions, which will need to be worked through during the legislative drafting process. We support the proposal to require all payment system participants (PSPs) to comply with relevant mandatory technical standards, subject to appropriate guardrails on the way such standards could be used and applied. The consultation on Mandatory Industry Scam Codes outlined the roles and responsibilities for Government, regulators and the private sector (banks, telcos and digital communication platforms) in addressing the growing prevalence of scams in Australia. Key points in our submission were: We support the introduction of a whole-of-ecosystem regulatory framework that will ensure all key sectors in the scams lifecycle take appropriate steps to prevent, detect, disrupt and respond to scams. The distinction between authorised and unauthorised fraud is a key concept in delineating scams from other types of fraudulent activity. Given the prevalence and impact of scam emails and websites, we strongly encourage the inclusion of internet service providers (ISPs) and email service providers within the scope of the framework. Some Members suggested that non-bank PSPs should also be designated, to ensure that customers are protected regardless of the payment method or service provider used, and to allow for better collaboration on disrupting scams across the entire payments ecosystem. The consultation on winding down Australia’s cheques system sought feedback on a proposed transition plan for closing down the cheques system by 2030, including the potential need for industry coordination and any challenges that need to be addressed to ensure an orderly transition. Our submission highlighted the following: Many Members are of the view that an orderly closure of the cheques system could be achieved earlier than 2030. The Government has a critical role in ensuring a smooth and timely transition and should make clear commitments on the process and timeframes for both reducing its own cheque usage and addressing any legislative and regulatory barriers to moving away from cheques. AusPayNet stands ready to play a leadership role in the transition, including through facilitating further discussions between Treasury and industry on finalising the transition plan, and working with industry on any coordination required among members to achieve the relevant milestones in the plan. Cash One topic which was not subject to a consultation but has received significant media coverage is cash, specifically on the economics of cash distribution and their implication for consumers’ access to cash. The RBA has convened roundtable discussions with industry participants to discuss what more could be done to promote the sustainability of cash distribution, and the ABA has received interim authorisation from the ACCC for authorisation to develop in-principle solutions to the challenges facing the cash distribution industry. In terms of the overall picture on cash, AusPayNet’s current role can best be described as operations support, while the RBA and the Government are responsible for the strategic direction and roadmap for continuing access to cash. The scope of AusPayNet’s current role in cash includes: Management of the Australian Cash Distribution & Exchange System (ACDES) Framework Management of the Decline of Cash Working Group including the commissioning of the annual cash usage trends survey performed by RFI Facilitation of the RBA’s Banknote Distribution Agreement Forum. We will continue to monitor developments in this space and consider changes to our role as necessary. top AusPayNet Summit 2023 AusPayNet held its annual Summit on 12 December at ICC Sydney, with the conference selling out for a second consecutive year. More than 500 delegates attended the event, themed ‘A Turning Point’, which comprised a dynamic mix of interviews and panel discussions, centred around the critical juncture at which payments finds itself, particularly following the release of the Government’s Strategic Plan for Australia’s Payments System . Headlining the event were RBA Governor, Michele Bullock, who made her first payments address since her appointment to the role, and the Hon Stephen Jones MP, who took part in a panel discussion on the role of regulation in the prevention of scams. We’ve prepared a highlights video to capture the essence of the day and would like to thank each of our speakers and valued event partners for making the Summit a resounding success. top Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) migration program update Following the AusPayNet Board’s approval to continue with Phase 1 (Initiation & Mobilisation) of this project, additional program-funded resources have been on-boarded to support delivery of this phase in 2024. Within the program: The Migration Planning Working Group (MPWG) met in February for the first time, focused on alignment of scope, objectives, and outcomes to deliver an AES Migration Strategy. The Standards & Requirements Working Group (SRWG)

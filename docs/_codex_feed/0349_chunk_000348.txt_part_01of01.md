What are specially printed cheques? Specially printed cheques are commonly used by companies and are usually printed with the company’s name and/or logo over a coloured background and other security features. The cheques must be pre-printed by commercial printers. While you can choose the colour and design of the cheque to suit your company image and/or computing requirements these must be compliant with the design requirements detailed in the “Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms” Security printers are best placed to advise you on design and security features that must be incorporated in the cheque stock. Companies seeking to print the MICR code line in-house should be aware that a different set of rules (outlined in “AusPayNet Guidelines for MICR Encoding Cheques”) apply. The key point to remember is that all specially printed cheque designs must be approved by your financial institution.

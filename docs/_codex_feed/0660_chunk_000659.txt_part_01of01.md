an active patch management process (to ensure that both the operating system and application environment is kept current and up to date to minimise exposure to any discovered flaws in those environments). The Terminal must, at a minimum, support 3DES encryption with full message encryption and authentication. Only unique key per Transaction or dynamic session keys are permitted for Terminal key management. Terminals with dynamic session key changes (application level) are required to change session keys every 256 Transactions or once per hour, whichever occurs first. Any remote support of merchant network and Terminals must be via a correctly configured and secured, remote access system.50 The Terminal application software must be secured against unauthorised changes or substitution. 3.2.5 Terminals Running Multiple Applications51 The following requirements apply to all Approved Devices running multiple applications including non-payment applications. The Terminal shall meet the requirements of clause 3.2.4(e) to 3.2.4(i). The Terminal payment application software must be secured against unauthorised changes or substitution using cryptographic mechanisms. The Terminal shall authenticate all applications using cryptographic mechanisms. 50 Amended effective 1/1/19, version 008 r&p 002.18 51 Amended effective 1/7/15, version 001 r&p 001.15 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE PART 3 –DEVICE SECURITY Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 16 The Payment application and its associated data (especially PINs and cryptographic keys) must be protected from any interference or corruption caused by any other data or other application(s).52 Payment and non-payment applications require individual evaluation and authorisation by the Acquirer, or a party explicitly trusted by the Acquirer, for each application to be deployed or updated. 53 3.3 Security Control Modules A Security Control Module (SCM) is a hardware device that provides an intentionally limited set of cryptographic services. 3.3.1 Function set [Deleted]54 3.3.2 43B43BDEA-1 From 1 January 2013 all symmetric encryption functionality weaker 55 than DEA-3 must have been disabled within every deployed SCM. 3.3.3 Security Control Module Management 56 SCMs must be managed in accordance with the requirements of AS 2805.14.2. The Sponsor must submit to the Management Committee an annual compliance statement confirming compliance with Annexes A.3, C.3, E.3 and either H.4 or H.5 in respect of any SCMs employed in the processing of Interchange Transactions. Annexure A of IAC Code Set Volume 1 (Introduction and Member Obligations), provides the required confirmation. Where the SCM provides support for ISO format 1 PIN blocks, such functionality must be disabled in all Acquiring and switching systems.57 3.3.4 Remote Management of Security Control Modules The requirements of this clause apply to systems which support remote access for the management of SCMs. SCM Access Requirements: (i) SCMs must be located in a secure, protected network, separate from generic internal or external access; (ii) there must be no uncontrolled connections between general internal and external networks; 52 Inserted effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 53 Inserted effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 54 Deleted effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 55 See ISO TR14742 for an understanding of which algorithms are weaker than DEA-3 56 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 57 Amended effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE PART 3 –DEVICE SECURITY Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 17 (iii) SCMs must be accessible only to authorised hosts and authorised applications; (iv) for TCP/IP implementations: (A) the SCM environment must be protected at a minimum by an IPS or IDS between the perimeter network firewall and the remote management device; (B) stateful firewalls must protect all external entry points to the SCM environment; and (C) such firewalls must log and monitor all inbound and outbound traffic to the SCMs; (v) there must be a procedure, which is audited on a regular basis, for the rapid disablement of known/suspected compromised remote management devices. Management of SCM Remote Management Solutions: (i) Remote Management Solutions may only be used with AusPayNet approved SCMs. (ii) All SCM Remote Management Solutions must have been approved as part of the Device Approval Process.58 (iii) Remote management devices may only be deployed in a minimally controlled environment, a controlled environment or a secure environment as per Annex H of AS 2805.14.2. At a minimum: (A) the storage of the Remote Management Solution must be under dual control; (B) the operation of the Remote Management Solution must be under dual control; and (C) while the Remote Management Solution is in operation access must be restricted to authorised personnel. 3.4 Key Loading and Transfer Devices Devices used in the initial cryptographic key loading of PEDs must be managed in accordance with the requirements of AS 2805.14.2. The Sponsor must submit to the Management Committee an annual compliance statement confirming compliance with Annexes A.3, E.3 and F.3 of AS 2805.14.2 in respect of any devices employed in the initial loading and 58 Amended effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE PART 3 –DEVICE SECURITY Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 18 transfer of PED cryptographic keys Annexure B of IAC Code Set Volume 1 (Introduction and Member Obligations), provides the required confirmation. 3.5 TCP/IP Host Requirements 59 The following requirements apply to host systems which support Terminals using the TCP/IP protocol for communications: stateful firewalls must protect all external entry points to the host environment; strong financial message protocol validation must be performed between Terminals and acquiring hosts; acquiring host must

CASE STUDY PCI Professional (PCIP) Training Real Experience. Real Benefits. No one tells our story better than our training participants themselves. Here’s what Randy had to say... Why did you choose to get training through the Council? I felt that getting PCIP training directly from the experts who created the standards would not only expand my current PA-DSS knowledge, but also help me attain a thorough knowledge and understanding of the PCI DSS. How does this training benefit you – and your company? The company launched a new program which was the driving factor for creating our Information Security Office - and for developing a plan for becoming PCI DSS compliant. The PCIP training has prepared me to define processes for performing internal security assessments and to work with QSAs to assess our corporate systems which must meet industry compliance requirements. The PCIP qualification along with demonstrating the applied knowledge gained from the training course, positions me for continued growth. As an early adopter of the PCIP qualification, it helps to set a standard and define baseline requirements for future team members as we develop and grow the Information Security Office. How have you applied what you learned in this course, in your job? In scoping our PCI DSS assessment, I’ve been able to apply what I learned in multiple ways, including: preparing a presentation for developers on PCI requirements and OWSAP, developing our Incident Response Plan, implementing daily review of IDS and log management systems, assessing our firewall and related systems configurations, and developing our security awareness program, to name a few. How do others view your new PCIP status? My PCIP qualification clearly identifies me as someone within the company who is knowledgeable in PCI requirements. My department is new to the organization and as a result, there was a significant change in my involvement with various teams. Being able to clearly and confidently communicate (and educate) the PCI Standards has enabled our internal teams to be more productive. If you had to pick one best thing about your training, what would it be? The Crazy Chicken Case Study was great! It really helped me to transition my thinking from a focused POS perspective to a broader enterprise perspective. THE COMPANY Excentus Corporation 14241 Dallas Parkway, Suite 1200 Dallas, TX 75254 Excentus Corporation is the leading provider of loyalty marketing programs and services that utilize cents per gallon fuel savings as the ultimate consumer reward - and holds nine patents on the associated technology for the Fuel Rewards Network.

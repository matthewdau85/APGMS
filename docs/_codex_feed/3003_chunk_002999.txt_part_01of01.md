All Rights Reserved. July 2021 Revision Types Table 2: Revision Types for PCI SSC Standards Type of Revision Potential Reasons for Revision Major (e.g., v1.0) • Restructure of standard such that reporting structure, portals, etc. need to change. • Significant updates to address technology changes or current threats to the payment ecosystem; may require investment by complying entities. Minor (e.g., v1.1) • Changes that do not meet threshold of a major revision. • Additions or modifications that change the intent of sub-requirements and/or testing procedures. • Changes that result in an update to implementation deadlines. • Examples include updates to address a new vulnerability or threat. Limited (e.g., v1.1.1) • Changes that do not meet the threshold of minor revision. • Changes to sub-requirements and/or testing procedures to clarify intent or address confusing language. Errata • Address format and clerical issues, such as typographical errors and misnumbering, or updates to amend future-dated requirements that have become mandatory. • Updates that consist only of errata are not subject to RFC. • Major, minor, or limited revisions that also include errata will be subject to RFC per this PCI SSC RFC Process Guide. PCI SSC RFC Process Guide, v1.1 Page 3 © 2021 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved. July 2021 RFC Process Table 3: PCI SSC RFC Process Steps Process Steps Details 1. PCI SSC provides community with notice prior to start of RFC. • PCI SSC updates the RFC page on the PCI SSC website with upcoming RFCs as soon as RFC timing is known. • A minimum of 14 days’ notice prior to commencement of the RFC via targeted e-mails. 2. PCI SSC prepares documents for the RFC. Documents in an RFC can include: • Standard or other subject document. • “Read Me First” document with RFC overview and instructions. • Summary of Changes document, if applicable. • Other documents related to the standard or subject document. • Other documents that aid the participants’ understanding of the RFC. 3. PCI SSC prepares the PCI SSC portal for the RFC. Each RFC has its own section in the PCI SSC portal with specific RFC materials, including: • A non-disclosure agreement covering the RFC documents. • Specifics of the standard or other subject document. • Type of feedback requested and structure for feedback submission: - Open or targeted feedback - Options for participants to categorize their feedback, which typically include: ⬧ Request for additional guidance ⬧ Request for clarification ⬧ Request for new/updated requirement. • Any unique information about the RFC or subject document that the RFC audience should be aware of.

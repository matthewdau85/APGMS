to those of its QSA Company clients with which QSA is then engaged to perform PCI SSC Assessments or other Services for which such revoked Qualification is required and, if applicable, of any conditions, restrictions or requirements of such Revocation that may impact its ability to perform such PCI SSC Assessments or other Services for such QSA Company clients going forward; and (vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the corresponding Addendum, PCI SSC may notify any of its Members and any acquirers, QSA Company clients or others of such Revocation and the reason(s) therefor. In the event QSA fails to submit a request for appeal within the allotted 30-day period or such request is denied, this Agreement or the Addendum corresponding to the Qualification that has been revoked (as applicable) shall automatically terminate and QSA’s right to such appeal shall be forfeited effective immediately as of the end of such period or such denial, as applicable. (c) All Revocation appeal proceedings will be conducted in accordance with such procedures as PCI SSC may establish from time to time for the applicable PCI SSC Program, PCI SSC will review all relevant evidence submitted by QSA and each complainant (if any) in connection with therewith, and PCI SSC shall determine whether termination of any Qualification provided to QSA by PCI SSC (including without limitation, Qualification as a QSA Company) is warranted or, in the alternative, no action, or specified remedial actions shall be required. All determinations of PCI SSC regarding Revocation and any related termination or appeals shall be final and binding upon QSA. If PCI SSC determines that termination is warranted, then effective immediately and automatically upon such determination, such Qualification and this Agreement and/or the applicable Addendum shall terminate. If PCI SSC determines that such termination is not warranted, the Revocation shall be lifted, the applicable Qualification shall be reinstated, and the listing of QSA that was removed from the QSA List as a result of such Revocation shall be reinstated. If PCI SSC determines that remedial action is required, PCI SSC shall notify QSA and may establish a date by which such remedial action must be completed; provided, however, that unless otherwise agreed by PCI SSC in writing the Revocation shall not be lifted, and QSA shall not be reinstated on the QSA List, unless and until such time as QSA has completed such remedial action; and provided, further, that if QSA fails to complete any required remedial actions by the date (if any) established by PCI SSC for completion thereof, PCI SSC may terminate the applicable Qualification and this Agreement and/or the applicable Addendum, effective immediately as of or any time after such date.

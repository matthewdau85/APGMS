to the organization’s PCI DSS compliance efforts. All impacted training and awareness materials should also be updated accordingly. 3.10.2 Organizational Changes Changes in an organization’s overall management and operational structure can alter the organization’s risk profile as well as the scope of their PCI DSS compliance efforts. For example, a merger, acquisition, or introduction of a new business line may introduce new payment channels that need to be considered. Similarly, when the organization insources or outsources operational processes, responsibility may shift for certain aspects of PCI DSS compliance activities (e.g., to a new internal team) that need to be understood and accounted for. Failure to determine how such changes impact the organization’s risk environment and PCI DSS scope could leave key business functions vulnerable to compromise or non-compliance. Other types of organizational changes that warrant consideration can include internal restructuring, corporate spin-offs, bankruptcies and liquidations, and loss of key IT or security personnel. Organizations should build in processes for detecting and responding to such changes in a timely manner and establish manual or automated triggers to alert key personnel so any associated risks can be analyzed with due diligence. This risk analysis should evaluate the potential impact that changes may have on an organization’s business objectives, PCI DSS scope, and overall compliance status. With each type of organizational change, there will be a unique set of issues to be considered when analyzing the scope and impact on PCI DSS compliance. Some examples of organizational changes that may impact how an entity manages their PCI DSS compliance include: ▪ Acquisition of an entity that is not PCI DSS compliant or that is subject to different compliance obligations. ▪ Detected shifts in corporate culture—either positive or negative—toward compliance or security.

After analyzing the impact organizational changes have to the risk environment and PCI DSS scope, security controls may need to be added, modified, or replaced to mitigate any additional risks or security gaps that have surfaced as a result. Policies and procedures may need to be updated; new security systems installed; key security responsibilities modified or shifted to new people; third-party agreements augmented, renewed, or terminated; and new payment channels may need to be included in assessment planning processes. Additionally, an organization may have different PCI DSS validation and reporting obligations (e.g., from a self-assessment and SAQ to a full onsite assessment with a ROC) as a result of organizational changes. Regardless of the results of the analysis, it is critical that adequate and appropriate responses to such changes are implemented. 3.10.3 Changes in the Operational Environment Any change to the network architecture or infrastructures directly related to or supporting the CDE should be reviewed prior to implementation. Examples of such changes include, but are not limited to, the deployment of new systems or applications, changes in system or network configurations, and changes in overall system topologies. Reviews of such changes related to the CDE are already required by PCI DSS Requirement 6.4. However, changes to system, network, or security architectures and configurations—even those that seem unrelated to the CDE—may also have a downstream impact. Organizations should therefore thoroughly evaluate how any changes to the operating environments might impact the scope or status of the organization’s PCI DSS compliance (see Appendix C: Applicability of PCI DSS Requirements to Assets Type,” for additional information). Prior to any modification to the environment, all the systems and networks affected by the change—including any new systems—should be identified. One question that should be considered is: “Do the changes introduce new connections between systems in the CDE and other systems that could bring additional systems or networks into scope for PCI DSS?” Consideration should also be given to how the proposed change may affect the technologies or underlying infrastructure that supports the security of the CDE. Examples of changes that may have such an impact include those made to network-traffic routing rules, firewall rules, DNS configurations, or other security-related functions. After the impacted system components and networks have been identified, all applicable PCI DSS requirements for those systems and networks must be evaluated. For example, any new system added to the CDE would need to be configured in accordance with defined system- configuration standards⎯including password-complexity settings, access-control configurations, Information Supplement • Best Practices for Maintaining PCI DSS Compliance • January 2019 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

The new system would also need to be included in quarterly vulnerability scanning schedules and integrated into other security and monitoring processes such as centralized logging, file-integrity monitoring, antivirus, etc. 3.10.4 End of Life Technology Reviews Organizations should also periodically review the technologies supporting the CDE to confirm that they continue to support the security

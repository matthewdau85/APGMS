identification number." A unique number known only to the user and a system to authenticate the user to the system. Typical PINs are used for automated teller machines for cash advance transactions, or for EMV chip cards to replace a cardholder’s signature. PINs help determine whether a cardholder is authorized to use the card and to prevent its unauthorized use if the card is stolen. Primary account number (PAN) * Unique number for credit and debit cards that identifies the cardholder account. 7 Glossary Data Security Essentials for Small Merchants: Glossary of Payment and Information Security Terms | August 2018 Copyright 2018 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved. TERM DEFINITION Privilege Abuse Using computer system access privileges in an abusive manner. Examples include a system administrator accessing card data for malicious purposes, or someone stealing and using an administrator’s elevated access privileges for malicious purposes. PTS * Acronym for the PCI Council’s PIN Transaction Security standard. PTS is a set of modular evaluation requirements for PIN acceptance point-of-interaction (POI) terminals. See details at www.pcisecuritystandards.org. QIR * Acronym for “Qualified Integrator or Reseller.” QIRs are integrators and resellers specially trained by the PCI Security Standards Council to address critical security controls when installing merchant payment systems. See details at www.pcisecuritystandards.org. Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) * A company approved by the PCI Security Standards Council to validate an entity’s adherence to PCI DSS requirements. Recurring Payment A billing method where merchants bill their customers repeatedly over time, such as for monthly memberships or subscriptions. A secure way to do this is for the acquirer/processor to tokenize the card data, which ensures its protection and relieves the merchant from this responsibility. Remote Access * Access to a computer network from a location outside of that network. Remote access connections can originate either from inside the company’s own network or from a remote location. An example of technology for remote access is a virtual private network (VPN). Remote access can be either internal (e.g. IT support) or external (e.g., service providers, third-party agents, integrators/resellers). Reseller / Integrator * An entity that sells and/or integrates payment applications but does not develop them. Router * Hardware or software that connects two or more internal or external computer networks to “route” or guide data through a network, and to ensure the data flows properly between those networks. The router can also create more security by permitting only approved traffic and denying unapproved traffic. Secure Card Reader (SCR) A PTS-approved device that attaches to a mobile phone or tablet for securely accepting payment cards. PCI PTS-approved SCRs protect and encrypt the card data via SRED. See also SRED. Security Code * A three- or four-digit value printed onto the front or back signature panel of a payment card. This code is uniquely associated with an individual card and is used as an additional check to ensure that the card is in possession of the legitimate cardholder, typically during a card-not-present transaction. Also referred to as card security code. 8 Glossary Data Security Essentials for Small Merchants: Glossary of Payment and Information Security Terms | August 2018 Copyright 2018 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved. TERM DEFINITION Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) * A questionnaire covering a set of PCI DSS requirements that is completed by the organization itself to confirm it is meeting those requirements. Sensitive Authentication Data * Security-related information used to authenticate cardholders and/or authorize payment card transactions, stored on the card’s magnetic stripe or chip. Service Provider * A business entity that provides various services to merchants. Typically, these entities store, process, or transmit card data on behalf of another entity (such as a merchant) OR are managed service providers that provide managed firewalls, intrusion detection, hosting, and other IT-related services. Also called a “vendor.” Skimming Stealing card data directly from the consumer’s payment card or from the payment infrastructure at a merchant location such as with an unauthorized hand-held card reader or via modifications made to the merchant’s payment terminal. Its purpose is to commit fraud, the threat is serious, and it can hit any merchant’s environment. Skimming Device A physical device, often attached to a card-reading device, designed to illegally capture and/or store the information from a payment card. Also called a “card skimmer.” Small Merchant A small merchant is typically an independently owned and operated business with a single location or a few locations, and with limited or no IT budget and often with no IT personnel. Whether a small merchant is required to validate PCI compliance is determined by the payment brand or acquirer (merchant bank). SRED An acronym for “Secure Reading and Exchange of Data.” A set of PCI PTS requirements designed to protect and encrypt card data in payment terminals. A PCI Council-listed Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE) solution must use a PTS-approved and listed payment terminal with SRED enabled and actively performing card data encryption. Stand-Alone Terminal A payment terminal that does not rely on connection to any other device within the merchant environment and performs no other functions. The only requirement for it to operate is a connection to the processor through either an Internet connection or a telephone line. If the terminal requires connection to a computerized electronic cash register or is multi-function (like a mobile device), it is not a stand-alone terminal. Strong Authentication Used to verify the identity of a user or device to ensure the

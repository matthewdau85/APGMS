PCI SSC, provide notice of such Revocation to those of its SSF Assessor Company clients with which SSF Assessor is then engaged to perform any SSF Assessment or other Services for which such revoked Qualification is required and, if applicable, of any conditions, restrictions or requirements of such Revocation that may impact its ability to perform such SSF Assessment or other Services for such SSF Assessor Company clients going forward; and (v) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, PCI SSC may notify any of its Members and any acquirers, SSF Assessor Company clients, or others of such Revocation and the reason(s) therefor. In the event SSF Assessor fails to submit a request for appeal within the allotted 30-day period or such request is denied, this Agreement shall automatically terminate and SSF Assessor’s right to such appeal shall be forfeited effective immediately as of the end of such period or such denial, as applicable. c. All Revocation appeal proceedings will be conducted in accordance with such procedures as PCI SSC may establish from time to time for the SSF, PCI SSC will review all relevant evidence submitted by SSF Assessor and each complainant (if any) in connection with therewith, and PCI SSC shall determine whether termination of SSF Assessor’s Qualification is warranted or, in the alternative, no action, or specified remedial actions shall be required. All determinations of PCI SSC regarding Revocation and any related termination or appeals shall be final and binding upon SSF Assessor. If PCI SSC determines that termination is warranted, then effective immediately and automatically upon such determination, such Qualification and this Agreement shall terminate. If PCI SSC determines that such termination is not warranted, the Revocation shall be lifted, such Qualification shall be reinstated, and the listing of SSF Assessor that was removed from the SSF Assessor List as a result of such Revocation shall be reinstated. If PCI SSC determines that remedial action is required, PCI SSC shall notify SSF Assessor and may establish a date by which such remedial action must be completed; provided, however, that unless otherwise agreed by PCI SSC in writing the Revocation shall not be lifted, and SSF Assessor shall not be reinstated on the SSF Assessor List, unless and until such time as SSF Assessor has completed such remedial action; and provided, further, that if SSF Assessor fails to complete any required remedial actions by the date (if any) established by PCI SSC for completion thereof, PCI SSC may terminate such Qualification and this Agreement, effective immediately as of or any time after such date.

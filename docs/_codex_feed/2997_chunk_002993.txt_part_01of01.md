automation pipeline, should be reviewed for strong authentication control and audit of activities (PCI DSS Requirements 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3). ▪ Consider including a vulnerability scan at the start of an instance, container API or service launch to provide a record of the artifact and a review of change impact. ▪ Penetration tests (PCI DSS Requirement 11.3) should include the provisioning and orchestration automation as well as the provisioned environment, including controls around the image templates and dynamic network creation. E.10 Data Encryption and Cryptographic Key Management In a public cloud environment, one Customer’s data is typically stored with data belonging to multiple other Customers. This makes a public cloud an attractive target for attackers, as the potential gain may be greater than that to be attained from attacking a number of organizations individually. Strong data-level encryption should be enforced on all sensitive or potentially sensitive data stored in a public cloud. Because compromise of a Provider could result in unauthorized access to multiple data stores, it is recommended that cryptographic keys used to encrypt/decrypt sensitive data be stored and managed independently from the cloud service where the data is located. At a minimum, key- management servers should be located in a separate network segment and protected with access credentials separate from the VMs that are using the keys and the data encrypted with them. Only defined, authorized key custodians should have access to cryptographic keys. Because access to both keys and encrypted data provides the ability to decrypt the data, Customers will need to verify who has access to cryptographic keys, who has access to the encrypted data and who has access to both. If a Customer shares encryption keys with the Provider, or engages the Provider as a key custodian, details of Provider access permissions and processes will also need to be reviewed and verified. This consideration is particularly critical if cryptographic keys are stored or hosted by a third-party Provider that also hosts the encrypted data. If Provider personnel have access to a Customer’s keys and the Customer’s encrypted data, the Customer may have unintentionally granted the Provider ability to decrypt its sensitive data. Any data that is decrypted in the cloud may be inadvertently captured in clear text in process memory or VMs via cloud maintenance functions (such as snapshots, backups, monitoring tools, etc.). To avoid this risk, Customers may choose to keep all encryption/decryption operations and key management on their own premises, and use a public cloud only for storage of the encrypted data. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 71 Applicable controls must be applied to the encryption, decryption, and key-management processes to ensure that data can only be retrieved (decrypted) by those who are authorized with a defined business need. Providers providing cryptographic-key management services for their Customers, such as Cloud HSM (see Section E.11, “Secure Cryptography Devices in the Cloud”) should ensure that secret or private keys are not shared among Customerseach Customer should be provided with a unique key or set of keys. Secure channels for access to the cloud environment also require proper key management. If the Provider uses images or cloning for protecting VMs, it is strongly recommended that keys not be cloned as part of the VM imageeach clone or VM instance should have its own key(s).29 Finally, the field of cryptography is continually evolving, and new cryptographic techniques and technologies (e.g., bit splitting and homomorphic encryption) are emerging to protect sensitive information. As these technologies are new, proper due diligence has to take place to weigh the pros and cons before deciding to acquire or build a solution utilizing these technologies. E.11 Secure Cryptography Devices in the Cloud The need for specialized cryptographic services to perform key management, random number generation, encryption, or decryption is applicable to cloud systems, microservices and other specialized workloads that must protect account data in the cloud or perform other security services. To accommodate this need, Providers may provide cryptographic functions that are accessible via API. Some such services may employ the use of actual PCI PTS- or FIPS-approved secure cryptography devices (SCDs), such as hardware security modules (HSM). Others may use specialized software-based services or non-certified hardware to perform these services. Due to the nature of cloud services, it may not be readily apparent whether the cryptography function is performed by an actual SCD, whether required certifications are in place or whether certain physical and logical controls are used by the Provider to protect the physical hardware. The roles and responsibilities for all key management functions when using a cloud SCD must be documented to assure coverage of all requirements, including generating keys of appropriate strength, secure distribution of keys from the SCD and operational policies. It is the responsibility of the Customer to confirm that any applicable hardware requirements are being met by the Provider performing cryptographic functions on its behalf. For instance, PCI DSS specifies an SCD as one way in which a key used for decryption of stored account data at rest should be stored (PCI DSS Requirement 3.5.3). A Customer may meet this requirement using a Provider’s cryptography service only if the Provider is using actual SCD hardware to deliver the service. Similarly, the Provider is also responsible for physical security controls,

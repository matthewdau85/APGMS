Customer’s responsibility to implement, manage and validate as part of its own PCI DSS compliance. The Customer should discuss its needs with the Provider to determine how the Provider can provide assurance that required controls are in place. Providers that have undergone PCI DSS assessment to validate their compliance will have the results summarized in an AOC and detailed in a Report on Compliance (ROC) or Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) D for Service Providers. The Executive Summary and Scope of Work sections of the ROC should detail the scope of the assessment including the specific components, facilities and services that were assessed. Evaluation and attestation by a PCI-qualified and trained assessor provide higher levels of assurance that PCI DSS requirements were understood and testing procedures were followed. If a Provider’s assessment was not performed by a PCI-qualified and trained assessor, the Customer may wish to ask additional questions about the rigor of the assessment, the qualification of the assessor and so on. 5.3 Verifying PCI DSS Controls Managed by the Cloud Service Provider As with all hosted services in scope for PCI DSS, the Customer should request sufficient evidence and assurance from its Provider that all in-scope processes and components under the Provider’s control are PCI DSS compliant. This verification may be completed by the Customer’s assessor (such as a QSA or ISA) as part of the Customer’s PCI DSS assessment. If the Provider has already undergone a PCI DSS assessment that was performed by another assessor, the Customer’s assessor will need to verify that the Provider’s validation is current, that the assessment covered all services provided to or used by the Customer and that all applicable requirements were found to be in place for the environments and systems in scope. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 29 Providers that have undergone PCI DSS compliance assessment and validation should be able to provide their Customers with the following: ▪ Proof of compliance documentation (such as the AOC and applicable sections from the ROC), including date of compliance assessment ▪ Documented evidence of system components and services that were included in the PCI DSS assessment (as applicable to the service) ▪ Documented evidence of system components and services that were excluded from the PCI DSS assessment (as applicable to the service) ▪ Documented evidence (such as the AOC and applicable sections from the ROC) of compensating controls that were used to meet any of the PCI DSS requirements ▪ Appropriate contract language (per PCI DSS Requirements 12.8.2 and 12.9) Providers that have not undergone PCI DSS compliance assessment will need to be included in their Customer’s assessment. The Provider will need to agree to provide the Customer’s assessor (i.e., an ISA or a QSA) with access to its environment or an environment managed by a third-party service provider (see Section 3.4, “Nested Service Provider Relationships,”) in order for the Customer to complete its assessment. The Customer’s assessor may require onsite access and detailed information from the Provider, including but not limited to: ▪ Access to systems, facilities and appropriate personnel for onsite reviews, interviews, physical walk- throughs, etc. ▪ Policies and procedures, process documentation, configuration standards, training records, incident response plans, etc. ▪ Evidence (such as configurations, screen shots, segmentation testing reports, process reviews, etc.) to show that all applicable PCI DSS requirements are being met for the in-scope system components ▪ Appropriate contract language (per PCI DSS Requirements 12.8.2 and 12.9) The Customer and Provider will need to agree upon which assessment activities can be performed by the Customer and which testing is the responsibility of the Provider. For example, in an IaaS/PaaS service, the Customer may wish to test within its own environment and whatever else it can access, such as the boundaries between itself and other Customers, or between itself and the Provider’s systems. However, if such testing is not permitted by the Provider, the Customer will have to rely on the Provider to perform and validate these requirements. In SaaS environments, the Customer will have limited or no visibility or permission to perform testing, and will generally be reliant on the Provider for all testing and validation. Defined testing activities and their associated controls and permissions should be detailed in the SLA. Ideally, the Provider should be able to provide Customers with specific details, as applicable to the ongoing maintenance of PCI DSS compliance. For example, depending on the service provided, the Provider could provide copies of log files, patch update records or firewall rule-sets that specifically apply to an individual Customer’s environment. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 30 Providers wishing to provide a PCI DSS compliant service may want to consider isolating the PCI DSS compliant services from their non-PCI DSS compliant services. This may help to simplify the compliance validation process for both the Provider and for its individual Customers. It may also help the Provider to standardize the PCI DSS compliant services being provided to its Customers.

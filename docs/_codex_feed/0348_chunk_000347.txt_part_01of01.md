cannot be revealed when held up to light.  Discuss with your financial institution alternative methods of remitting large amounts.  Paper Handling Other considerations associated with MICR encoding relate to maintaining the condition of paper used when laser printing MICR encoded documents, to optimise the efficiency of your printing system. Environmental conditions have a major impact on laser printing operations. Of equal importance is acclimatising (“pre-conditioning”) the paper before printing. The following guidelines can help you avoid problems with paper handling, and poor adhesion of the toner to the paper. These guidelines are based on commonly accepted practices within the printing industry. Adjusting Temperature and Humidity Temperature and humidity control are important factors in printing performance. High humidity can cause paper to develop wavy edges, while low humidity can cause paper to have tight edges. Both of these conditions can cause misfeeds, jams, or wrinkling during printing. The moisture content of the paper will affect how well toner adheres to the paper when the amount and payee details are printed on the cheque (“toner adhesion”) and thus “permanence” of the printing on the cheque. Optimum conditions for storage and printing are:  A temperature of 20-24 o C for paper storage and printing;  A relative humidity of 45-55% for paper storage; and  A moisture content of 4-6% in the forms going into the laser printer (a moisture content of 4-5% is recommended for optimum performance).  Maximum toner adhesion and permanence is achieved when the moisture content of the paper is maintained at 4.5% to 5.5%.  Printing on paper with moisture content above 5.5% will reduce toner adhesion which may mean that the printing does not have an acceptable level of permanence. When adjusting relative humidity to remedy signs of paper waviness, tight edges or excessive away-from-image curl, do so in increments of 5-10%, and allow sufficient time between adjustments to test the effectiveness of the new conditions. Guidelines for Companies Intending to Issue MICR Encoded Cheques P a g e | 7 AusPayNet September 2017 Acclimatising Paper Large, sudden changes in temperature and humidity can cause paper to distort, affecting printing performance. When moving stock from the storage to the printing area:  Avoid placing forms in front of air-conditioning or heating vents;  Place the forms in the printing area long enough for them to acclimatise to the new conditions;  Remove moisture proof wrappers only when the temperature has stabilised; and  Allow sufficient time after removal of wrappers for the moisture content of the paper to stabilise. The following table can be used as a guide for determining the time needed to pre-condition stacked, unopened cartons containing five reams of paper, moved as stacked pallets. The numbers of hours listed in the table indicate the minimum numbers of hours the cartons should be left unopened in the printing area prior to use, based on differences in storage and printing temperatures. Number of Cartons Temperature Difference between Storage and Printing Areas (Degrees Celsius) 5.5o 8.5o 11o 13o 17o 22o 28o 1 4 hrs 8 hrs 11 hrs 14 hrs 17 hrs 24 hrs 34 hrs 5 5 hrs 9 hrs 12 hrs 15 hrs 18 hrs 25 hrs 35 hrs 10 8 hrs 14 hrs 18 hrs 22 hrs 27 hrs 38 hrs 51 hrs 20 11 hrs 16 hrs 23 hrs 28 hrs 35 hrs 48 hrs 67 hrs 40 14 hrs 19 hrs 26 hrs 32 hrs 38 hrs 54 hrs 75 hrs Acclimatising can be accelerated by unstacking the cartons or reams of paper. Reams however, should only be unsealed when you are ready to load the paper into the printer.

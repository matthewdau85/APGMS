Hard cut-off time. Step 7 must be complete by this time. Step 9 RITS recovery continues. 6.5 hrs Where necessary, the RBA continue work to recover RITS ready for the overnight processing required before the next day. RBA Step 10 RITS reports and overnight processing occurs. RBA proceed with normal report production and overnight processing required to prepare RITS for the next day. Step 11 RITS connection to SWIFT Feeder restored. Once RITS is recovered and the system date has rolled forward, the SWIFT Feeder connection is restored. The backlog of settlement requests held in the CSI from T-Copy clearing the previous day will enter RITS and be rejected due to the back-dated value date. Senders can use the RITS UI to view the record of rejected T-Copy settlement requests (see Step 12). Checkpoint RITS available. 06:30 RITS to be available by this time to prepare contingency batch. Step 12 Participants perform optional reconciliation of HVCS Exchange Summary Forms to RITS. 30 min Using the RITS UI, Participants can export a record of payments sent in T-Copy the previous day (Step 4) and rejected by RITS (Step 11). Participants can also obtain a record of payments settled or rejected by RITS prior to the Disabling Event using statements produced in Step 10, or the RITS UI. Participants can elect to use these RITS records to reconcile the net obligations in their Exchange Summary Forms which may help to resolve a failure to match discrepancy identified in Step 7. Participants HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 137 Where required, Participants can submit a revised HVCS Exchange Summary Form to the RBA at any time between Step 8 and Step 12 (inclusive). Checkpoint HVCS Exchange Summary Form discrepancies rectified. 07:00 1. RBA applies Failure To Match (FTM) rules to all remaining discrepancies. Step 13 RBA produces and sends Final Exchange Figures Advice & Net Clearing System Obligations Advice to Participants. 30 min 2. The RBA apply FTM rules in accordance with Clause 9.32(a) of these Procedures to any remaining discrepancies in Participant’s HVCS Exchange Summary Form and sends a Final HVCS Exchange Figures Advice to Participants via encrypted email. 3. This will include a Net Clearing System Obligations Advice that shows a Participant’s multilateral net position in the contingency batch, including clearing interest RBA Checkpoint RITS Morning Settlement Session starts. 07:30 RBA enters the contingency batch in RITS at the commencement of the Morning Settlement Session (MSS). Step 14 Participants pre-fund ESAs. 25 min Where required, Participants pre-fund their ESA in preparation for settlement of the contingency batch. Participants Step 15 Contingency batch entered in RITS and settlement testing begins. 5 min Batch obligations could settle immediately if all Participants in the batch have sufficient ESA funds. RBA Step 16 Contingency batch settlement testing period. 30 min Participants with a shortfall of ESA funds must finalise funding within this 30 minute window. Settlement testing for the contingency batch times out after 30 minutes. Participants Checkpoint Contingency batch settled. 08:45 If the contingency batch has not settled by the end of this period the RBA may extend the MSS as necessary until the batch is settled. After 9.00am batch settlement occurs. 30 min Only processing associated with the 9.00am batch can be undertaken during this session. The contingency batch cannot settle in this session. RBA Checkpoint RITS Daily Settlement Session starts. 09:15 RITS Daily Settlement Session will not begin until the previous day’s HVCS obligations have settled. After Normal operations resume. - HVCS payments dispatched on the current day clear in Y-Copy mode. - HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 138 4 Participant Outage Runsheet This runsheet outlines the checkpoint times and sequence of events for a Participant Fallback Period. It is based on the following assumptions: 1) The priority is recovering the Affected Participant’s Disabling Event in order to resume normal operations. As such, a decision to declare a Participant Fallback Period is unlikely to be taken ahead of the checkpoint times outlined. However, if the Affected Participant has urgent payments to send and cannot estimate their recovery time; or is able to rule out a recovery ahead of the checkpoint times, then minimising the delay to payments becomes a priority and a Participant Fallback Period could be declared earlier. 2) Where the Affected Participant has not recovered by 15:00, a Participant Fallback Period could be declared, during which time the Participant Fallback Solution can be used to send payments from the Affected Participant to Receivers. Payments to the Affected Participant must continue to go through the SWIFT PDS and will be queued in the Affected Participant’s SWIFT systems until their inward processing is restored. These payments will continue to be tested and settled in RITS as per the normal operation of the SWIFT PDS Feeder. 3) The Participant Fallback Period checkpoints are linked to RITS session times and rules. This allows Receivers to effectively manage their end of day liquidity operations and ensure they have sufficient operational staff available. 4) Outgoing payments from the Affected Participant to Receivers should be complete by the end of the RITS Settlement Close Session at 17:15.

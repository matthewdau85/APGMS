are commonly handled by general purpose computers which are not approved devices and are therefore not suitable for handling of plaintext PIN material. A PIN may only be transmitted as an encrypted PIN block output from an approved device. Clause 2.2 (e) requires online PIN blocks to comply with ISO 9564-1, excluding Format 1 and 2 but there is no restriction on the mechanism for transfer of encrypted PIN blocks. A RESTful API may be used to transfer an encrypted PIN block but not a plaintext PIN block or plaintext PIN data. B. Issuer Audit FAQ B.1. Is PIN change within an Issuer owned environment in scope? Yes, PIN change within an Issuer’s environment is in scope as compliance with ISO 9564-1 is mandatory for all PIN related activities (see clause 2.1 of Volume 2). B.2. Are issuing PIN activities outside of Interchange in scope of the IAC annual audit? Yes, section A.3 of the annual audit applies to all issuing services associated with the management of PINs and the associated cryptographic practices. An example of these PIN activities is card personalisation for cardholder’s PIN performed by a card manufacturer. B.3. Is the use of Approved Devices required for issuing PIN activities outside of Interchange? Branch terminal does not require to be an Approved Device. However, it is recommended to follow the device guidelines outlined in the IAC Code Set Volume 2, clause 3.6.1. SCM used outside of Interchange functions, such as PIN change or PIN selection, must be an Approved Device as per requirement set out in IAC Code Set Volume 2, clause 2.2. The minimum Accepted Standards are NIST 140-2 or NIST 140-3 level 3 for these SCMs. B.4. Are on-us transactions and cash deposits via a cash/coin counting machine to the cardholder’s cheque or savings account in scope for the audit? All “on-us” non-PIN transactions which are not routed via Interchange Links are not in scope for the audit. Any cash/coin counting machines that have PIN entry functionality must be a secure cryptographic device in conformance with ISO 9564.1 but does not require AusPayNet/IAC approval. Note that the PIN must be encrypted when transmitted from the cash/coin counting machine. SCMs used for handling plaintext PIN values or PIN-related cryptographic keys must be approved as per Vol 2, Clause 2.2. B.5. Does the scope of an annual audit include PINs used as a form of customer identification? The IAC code set applies to all usage of PIN for both acquirer and issuer functions. The applicable questions in the AusPayNet Annual Security Audit should be applied for all usages of PIN, including those cases not directly associated with payment transactions, e.g. PIN Change. B.6. Does this Audit include internal PIN-related key management and PIN related activities? The IAC Code Set Volume 2, clause 2.1, requires Issuers to be compliant to ISO 9564.1. Unless specifically exempted by the Code Set, this includes all PIN related activities. ISO 9564.1 requires compliance to ISO 11568 all parts (key management). Therefore, key management in respect of the annual audit includes all PIN key related activities including establishment, issuance, verification, selection, replacement and change. B.7. Requirement A.3.1(f) states ‘All parties to the interchange…maintain procedures and practices to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of Cardholder Data...’. Does the reference to interchange indicate the requirement _only_ applies to activities directly involving interchange (payment processing, settlement, disputes, etc.)? No, the requirement applies to all cardholder security related activities for all parties connected to the interchange. B.8. The Code Set, Vol 1, Part 2.1.1, requires all Devices (including NSTs and payment acceptance solutions) used in Interchange to have been approved by the Company. Can non-approved Devices be used for non-interchange purposes? Yes, unless prohibited by a different requirement. As an example, IAC Code Set Vol 2, Clause 2.2, requires SCMs handling or managing plaintext PINs and/or related keys to be Approved. This includes SCMs not involved in interchange. Devices used for issuer functionality related to PIN over open networks (e.g. cardholder selected PIN change via a banking app) are not connected to interchange, and therefore do not require approved devices. Alternative requirements apply as detailed in IAC Code Set Vol 2, Part 3. B.9. Do mobile banking apps with PIN change functionality need to comply with requirements in A.3.4 – General Security Control for PIN Usage over Open Networks? Yes, PIN change via a mobile banking app is classified as Issuer functionality and the internet is a type of Open Network. The app, supporting backend systems and relevant procedures must comply with requirements in Annex A.3.4. C. Acquirer Audit FAQ C.1. Does the IAC Code Set Volume 3, clause 2.4.5 Privacy of Communications apply to ATM transactions? No, this requirement applies only to EFTPOS terminals. C.2. When a cardholder performs a ‘balance inquiry’ can the ATM store the PIN in secure memory, to be used for subsequent transactions? EMV transactions currently allow this, and more specific requirements of the Code Set Volume 6, Annexure G.4.11 & G.4.12 noting that this is in contravention of PCI requirements. C.3. Would on-us transactions that are not sent over an open network apply to AusPayNet Audit requirements? No audit requirements will apply, however, there are a general IAC requirement for Issuers to comply with ISO 9564-1 : Basic principles and requirements for PINs in card-based systems C.4. What is the scope of PAN security as required by the issuer audit? The Issuer audit must consider

in the risk level assigned to the TPSP until the next review cycle.  If PCI DSS validation requirements are documented in the contract or agreement with the TPSP, notify the TPSP that the agreement terms are being enforced. 6.2.3 Third-party Service Provider Validates PCI DSS Compliance via Inclusion within the Entity’s PCI DSS Assessment A TPSP’s service can be included within the scope of the entity’s CDE. The following are considerations for inclusion:  Confirm that this situation is acceptable to the acquirer and/or payment card brand. 14 Refers to revision 1.0 – April 2015 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

The difference in compliance status can create a situation where a PCI DSS compliant entity or TPSP is contracted to a non-compliant entity or TPSP that is actively working towards PCI DSS compliance. If there is a shared non-compliant process or service previously not addressed, it would be appropriate for the agreements between the entity and the TPSP to detail whether the entity or TPSP is responsible for the applicable PCI DSS requirements. However, there is the possibility in previous PCI DSS audits this non-compliant status was not known, unintentionally not disclosed, or not fully understood, which may lead to an existing or new service to be found to be non-compliant. If a requested service will cause the TPSP or entity to become non-PCI DSS compliant or if during provision of the service a situation arises that changes the attributes of the service, determination of the impact to PCI DSS compliance for both the entity and the TPSP may be appropriate. Examples of such scenarios could include an entity sending sensitive authentication data to its TPSP for storage, or a TPSP implementing an infrastructure change that impacts segmentation controls between its hosted entities’ environments. It is recommended the following actions be considered:  If an agreement is not currently in place between the entity and the TPSP—e.g., new service request, new TPSP relationship—it is recommended the entity and TPSP consider performing an additional risk assessment to determine whether and how to proceed.  If an agreement exists between the entity and the TPSP, the entity may consider an examination of the contract or agreement with the TPSP to determine which party is responsible for mitigating the non-compliant data or process.  Consider whether the non-compliant service or process is essential and the impact of stopping it as soon as possible until a solution can be developed.

Discuss with legal counsel to ensure the entity or the TPSP and any nested TPSP use appropriate agreement/contract change provisions or clauses to negotiate a fair and reasonable timeframe to remediate the non-compliance issue.  Discuss with the TPSP and agree on introducing compensating controls as soon as possible that mitigate the risk of continuing with the non-compliant process or data exchange—while work continues on its remediation.  Prepare a remediation plan that can be provided to the entity or the TPSP in a form that can be used as evidence (e.g., Compensating Controls Worksheet) to provide a QSA if a PCI DSS compliance review is due within the remediation timeframe.  Ensure any nested TPSPs meet the agreed obligations with regard to remediating the non- compliant issue and keeps the TPSPs informed of progress.

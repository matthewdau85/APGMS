expectations states that “Gateways should ensure that their proprietary tokens do not impede merchants switching payment service providers”. Expectation 4.iii states that ”Token-holding entities should provide, in a secure way, any reasonable data to any ‘authorised’ third-party required to support token migration, and token migration should be executed in a timely manner.” Supporting the industry to meet the RBA’s portability expectations, the Standard aims to reduce the friction that can impede a merchant switching PSPs. An incumbent PSP being unwilling to send or sending incomplete customer payment-related data to a merchant’s new PSP may result in the merchant needing to recollect sensitive card payment details from their customers, or an increase in payment declines. The Standard prescribes a set of requirements for the Porting of MPR Data that: • details the mandatory payment-related data to be Ported between the Sending and Receiving Parties; 2.

Expectations for Tokenisation of Payment Cards and Storage of PANs - May 2024 | RBA AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS NETWORK 4 APPLICATION Entities holding merchant data approaching end-of-life It is acknowledged that entities holding a merchant’s MPR Data approaching end-of-life may choose not to adopt the Standard. However, these entities are still encouraged to follow the practices outlined in the Standard for Porting MPR Data, to enable the merchant to port their data with minimal issues. SCOPE Sending and Receiving Parties can either agree to apply the Standard or will be required to do so where they are unable to reach mutual agreement on the parameters of the data to be Ported between them. OUT OF SCOPE In addition to the items listed in clause 2.4.1 it was determined that the Standard would not consider or address: • Pricing related to the porting of MPR Data. However, Applicable Entities subject to the Standard are expected to note the RBA’s tokenisation expectation 4.iv that ‘only the reasonable costs of processing a token migration should be passed on to merchants’. • Interoperability of Proprietary Tokens. For example, the Standard does not enable a Proprietary Token issued by the Sending Party to be processed by the Receiving Party. • Interoperability of Scheme Tokens. The Standard does not enable a Scheme Token from one Scheme (e.g. Scheme A) to be processed by a different Scheme (e.g. Scheme B). DEPARTING FROM THE STANDARD • establishes a common, repeatable process that addresses best practice data Porting security requirements that PSPs can adopt rather than having to build bespoke solutions to Port between different PSPs. The Standard accommodates both the current prevalence of non-tokenised FPAN in the merchant payment-related data to be Ported, but also tokenised data that may be held by a PSP as either a Scheme Token or Proprietary Token. Clauses 2.2.2 and 2.5.1 make clear that the Requirements of the Standard apply when the Sending Party and Receiving Party are unable to mutually agree on the parameters of the data to be ported by the Sending Party. To that end the Standard does not seek to address or supersede any commercial terms and conditions as agreed between those parties. AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS NETWORK 5 PART 3 COMMON REQUIREMENTS REQUIREMENT #1: MERCHANT PAYMENT-RELATED DATA Clause 3.1.1 outlines the MPR Data to be ported by the Sending Party, ensuring that the Receiving Party receives the necessary payment-related data to enable future transactions by the merchant’s cardholder, without requiring the cardholder to provide sensitive card data, such as the PAN, again. While the MPR Data indicated in Table 1: Data Elements, is payment-related, it is important to note that the Sending Party may also hold additional financial and non-financial customer data on behalf of a merchant (e.g. recurring payment schedules, token status, customer email, customer billing address etc.). In such cases, the Primary Parties are expected to mutually agree on the Porting of this additional information to prevent the cardholder from needing to resupply it. Implicit in the Standard is that both the Sending Party and Receiving Party be PCI DSS compliant, and that the merchant has obtained cardholder consent to store the customer’s payment-related data. Absence of the FPAN In some cases, the PAN may no longer be held by the Sending Party, having been purged and replaced with one or more Scheme Tokens. Clause 3.1.1 of the Standard addresses this by specifying data fields in the minimum data to be ported, which can be defined by the Schemes to support their Token Migration Services. These services are expected to facilitate the porting of TPANs when the FPAN is no longer held by a PSP. It is noted that the FPAN is only a mandatory field if it is held by the Sending Party. If it has been deleted and replaced by Scheme Tokens, those Tokens should be migrated using the processes defined by the relevant Scheme. How Scheme Tokens are considered by the Standard The Standard does not aim to define how Tokens are used within the broader payments ecosystem, nor does it impose a uniform approach to tokenisation across the different Scheme Token providers. Instead, its purpose is to support the transfer of Scheme Token-related information that may be required by the merchant’s new PSP. Such information becomes relevant where the original FPAN has been replaced by

at ACSC: Implementing Multi Factor Authentication . If you have not implemented MFA, you should consider implementing passphrase management, account lockout and resetting passphrase practices described in the Australian Government Guidelines for system hardening . Single sign on DSPs must seek advice from the DPO on the use of enterprise Single Sign On (SSO) to support their clients. When implementing enterprise SSO, you must ensure that: disablement of MFA is controlled by the DSP, not the client encryption in transit between the client’s system and software uses an approved protocol as per the Australian Government Guidelines for using cryptography remember me on this device is limited to 24 hours SSO tokens is limited to a maximum period of 24 hours tokens or temporary credentials are isolated to an individual device and expire once used - tokens or temporary credentials must expire within 24 hours brute force lockouts are applied after a maximum of five unsuccessful login attempts credentials are stored separately from the system that grants access confirmation passwords are hashed, salted, and stretched inactive session time-out occurs after a maximum 30 minutes, 15 minutes is preferred (This is a screen lock process where full MFA is not required to unlock). ACSC authentication hardening includes additional guidance to support DSPs implementation. Note: Short Message Service (SMS) are more susceptible to compromise by an adversary than others. We therefore recommend you use an alternative authentication factor when appropriate. Evidence required Advise DPO that SSO has been implemented and meets the advised standards. We treat these implementation statements from DSPs regarding their (or their clients) SSO implementations; that they meet the intended aim of MFA, securing authentication and authorisation processes as MFA does. Certification Independent Certification The independent certification requirement provides us with a level of assurance that DSPs have robust security practices in place across their organisation. This is done by attaining independent certification against the iRAP or ISO/IEC 27001 standards. As part of the independent certification exercise, you will need to determine which controls from the chosen standard applies to your organisation. Where you deem a control is not applicable, you should address this in the statement of applicability. We do not prescribe which standard you should apply or provide links to them. Your choice of standards should be made based on its suitability to your organisation. The scope of independent certification should cover relevant organisational policies, procedures and data repositories that hold or manage tax or superannuation related information. The DPO recognises you may not be fully compliant with the complete range of controls of your chosen standard. The controls you should be compliant with will depend on your organisation’s operating model and the architecture of the product. We also acknowledge there may be areas where you are unable to demonstrate compliance with controls. In this scenario you will be required to offer supporting commentary to substantiate the non-compliance or the manner and timeframe in which you expect to address the gap. Independent certification should be reviewed at prescribed intervals or when significant changes occur within your environment. To meet the requirement for independent certification, you must maintain ongoing independent certification, and you will need to supply us with evidence of this. If there is a significant change in the environment that affect the controls addressed as part of independent certification, you are required to submit a revised version to us as soon as possible. IRAP/ISM The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) information security Registered Assessors Program (iRAP) accredits ICT professionals to assess organisations against the Australian Government’s Information Security Manual (ISM). An iRAP assessment will typically cover the organisation as a whole, (governed by a defined scope), and it assesses 24 key security domains against the ISM. iRAP assessments may be mandated as a firm requirement for commercial entities seeking to offer ICT services to federal government agencies as part of a formal procurement or tendering process. ISO/IEC 27001 ISO 27001 is generally completed at the organisational level. However, large organisations with diverse service or product offerings may limit the scope of the independent certification to relevant policies, procedures, and systems of the business unit responsible for the primary products or services which hold or transact Taxation, Accounting, Payroll, Business Registry or Superannuation data. To obtain independent certification, you will be required to engage a qualified, independent assessor annually to conduct an audit of your business in relation to the standard. Evidence required Completed documentation demonstrating conformance to one of the approved security standards outlined above Statement of applicability Letter of compliance Copy of certificate upon completion of independent certification. Self-Assessment The self-assessment requirement provides us with a level of assurance that DSPs have robust security practices in place across their organisation. This is done by self-assessing against one of the following standards: ISO/IEC 27001 ISO/IEC 27002 SOC2 OWASP ASVS 3.0 or latest version NIST As part of the self-assessment, you will need to determine which controls from the chosen standard apply to your organisation. Where you deems a control is not applicable, you should provide a short description as to why. The scope of certification should cover relevant organisational policies, procedures and data repositories that hold or manage Taxation, Accounting, Payroll, Business Registry or Superannuation related information. The DPO will accept this as evidence across multiple products when you can attest that each product or service is covered under the certification. You can request to use an alternative security standard

A customer complaint of unauthorised transaction which is, in the Issuer’s reasonable opinion, a Counterfeit ATM Transaction, is to be resolved in terms of this clause 4.6 if the Issuer claims against the Acquirer within 12 months after the transaction date. An Issuer cannot make a claim against an Acquirer under the clause 4.5(c) liability shift indemnity more than 12 months after the date of the Counterfeit ATM Transaction. The timeframes in this clause 4.6 for the resolution of a claim made within the 12 month period are intended to be consistent with the timeframes for resolution of customer complaints under the ePayments Code. They are also broadly consistent with those for resolution of Disputed Transactions as set out in Part 4 of the ATM System Code. This process utilises the Disputed Transaction File (Annexure M) but is simplified to reflect the fact that extended investigation by the Acquirer is unnecessary in the case of Counterfeit ATM Transactions claims.14 14 Last amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 15 Last amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 16 Amended effective 3/7/17, version 005 r&p 001.17 17 Amended effective 21/11/17, version 006 r&p 002.17 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 6 – ATM SYSTEM CODE PART 4.

IAC CODE SET VOLUME 4 - DEVICE REQUIREMENTS AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT ANNEXURE F. INTRODUCTION TO DEVICE SUPPORT AND SCM FUNCTIONALITY Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 26 ANNEXURE F. INTRODUCTION TO DEVICE SUPPORT AND SCM FUNCTIONALITY [Informative] F.1 Introduction This annexure illustrates how the functionality provided by the AusPayNet SCM may be used to provide device driving support for ATMs and POS Terminals including remote initialisation. It is based on the use of the approved triple-DES SCM specification referred to as AusPayNet SCM specification which is at revision V5.0 at the time of writing (January 2015) This annexure illustrates a method of implementing both ATM and POS device support using AusPayNet specification Security Control Modules. Only a limited subset of the possible key management schemes and associated SCM functions are described, in particular, transaction based key management schemes are not addressed. Description of transactions and messages is confined to cryptographic items such as keys, PIN blocks, and MACs, and excludes financial and other items. F.2 References and Related Documentation 1.

F.3 Overview Section F.4 describes the key specifiers which the AusPayNet SCMs use to manage keys with different lengths and attributes. It also describes the key variants that are used. Section F.5 shows how AusPayNet SCM functions can be used to perform 3DES ATM key management with double-length keys, MACing, and remote initialisation. The AusPayNet SCM functions currently only provide support for NCR’s NDC+ 3DES ATMs. Details of other ATM manufacturer’s

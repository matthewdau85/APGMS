compliance Copy of certificate upon completion of independent certification. Self-Assessment The self-assessment requirement provides us with a level of assurance that DSPs have robust security practices in place across their organisation. This is done by self-assessing against one of the following standards: ISO/IEC 27001 ISO/IEC 27002 SOC2 OWASP ASVS 3.0 or latest version NIST As part of the self-assessment, you will need to determine which controls from the chosen standard apply to your organisation. Where you deems a control is not applicable, you should provide a short description as to why. The scope of certification should cover relevant organisational policies, procedures and data repositories that hold or manage Taxation, Accounting, Payroll, Business Registry or Superannuation related information. The DPO will accept this as evidence across multiple products when you can attest that each product or service is covered under the certification. You can request to use an alternative security standard if you consider it more suitable given your circumstances. These requests will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Your choice of what standard to self-certify against should be made based on its suitability to your organisation. We do not prescribe which standard you should use. The DPO recognises you may not be fully compliant with the complete range of controls of your chosen standard. The controls you should be compliant with depends on your organisation’s operating model and the architecture of your product or service. We also acknowledge there may be areas where you are unable to demonstrate compliance with controls. In these scenarios you will be required to offer supporting commentary to substantiate the non-compliance or the manner and timeframe in which you expect to address the gap. Your self-assessment should be reviewed at prescribed intervals or when significant changes occur within your environment. However, you must review your self-assessment annually and resubmit an updated version every 2 years. If there has been a significant change in your environment which affects the controls you addressed as part of your self-assessment, you will be required to submit a revised version to us as soon as possible. ISO/IEC 27001 ISO/IEC 27001 is generally completed at the organisational level, however large organisations with diverse product or service offerings may limit the scope of the self-assessment to relevant policies, procedures, and systems of the business unity response for the primary products or services which hold or transact Taxation, Accounting, Payroll, Business Registry or Superannuation data. All controls need to be answered, with notes next to each control as to how you achieved compliance or why the control does not apply. We do not expect you to be compliant with all controls, as this will depend on your organisation’s operating model and the architecture of your product or service. ISO/IEC 27002 ISO/IEC 27002 provides guidance for organisational information security standards and information security management practices. It includes the selection, implementation and management of controls taking into consideration the organisation's information security risk environment. It is designed to be used by organisations intending to: select controls within the process of implementing an Information Security Management System based on ISO/IEC 27001 implement commonly accepted information security controls develop their own information security management guidelines. ISO/IEC 27017 ISO/IEC 27017 provides guidelines for information security controls that apply to the use of cloud services by providing an additional implementation guidance for 37 controls specified in ISO/IEC 27002 and 7 additional controls related to cloud services. OWASP ASVS 3.0 OWASP ASVS 3.0 is completed at the product or application level. The controls need to be completed to Standard 2 as a minimum, with notes next to each control detailing what you need to do to manage the control, and if it does not apply, why. We do not expect you to be compliant with all Standard 2 controls, as this will depend on the architecture of your product or service. SOC2 SOC2 (System and Organizational Controls) is generally completed at the product or application level. It refers to a collection of control criteria related to how an organization regulates their information. The controls relate to risk management, change management, system operations, logical and physical access controls, and monitoring of controls. SOC2 is the most comprehensive in the SOC family and it is most suited to IT service providers. NIST The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a policy framework of computer security guidance to assess and approve an organisations’ ability to prevent, detect and respond to cyber-attacks. The framework is devised into five main functions of identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. These functions support an organisation in expressing a level of cyber security risk by addressing threats and developing learnings. NIST is to be completed via a maturity assessment and can only be applied to Category B (medium to high-risk APIs) and Category C (low to no risk APIs) DSPs. Evidence required Documentation demonstrating compliance to one of the approved security standards must include notes on how controls are applied in your organisation and if applicable, why certain controls may not be applied. Data hosting DSPs must provide details of their hosting provider to us. This requirement seeks to limit the risk of access to Taxation, Accounting, Payroll, Business Registry or Superannuation related information by individuals with no authority, including foreign actors. By default, a DSP should host data onshore. Offshore hosting arrangements will be managed by exception on a case-by-case basis. Where a DSP is planning to

fraud. RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA BULLETIN – SEPTEMBER 2018 7 3. The payer institution then sends a message with all the relevant payment details, subject to any overlay service requirements, to the payee's institution using its payment gateway. The payee's institution clears the payment by checking the payment details and sends a response back to the payer's institution via its payment gateway, confirming it is able to credit the payee. 4. With clearing of the payment complete, the payer institution's payment gateway automatically initiates settlement by sending a settlement request to the FSS, which tests that the payer institution has sufficient credit funds, and then transfers value between the two institutions' ESAs in real time by simultaneously debiting the ESA of the payer institution and crediting the ESA of the payee institution. 5. The FSS then returns a settlement confirmation to both institutions indicating that settlement has occurred. 6. Once the settlement confirmation has been received, the payee ADI makes the funds available to its payee customer. How are NPP payments settled by the FSS? Individual NPP payments are settled with finality by simultaneously crediting and debiting ESAs held at the Reserve Bank. Although the FSS uses some of the existing RITS infrastructure (such as the user interface), NPP payments are settled by the FSS independent of other types of payments submitted to RITS (which are settled by the RITS System Queue). While RITS members use a single ESA to settle payments, institutions divide their ESA funds between an FSS Allocation and a RITS Allocation. NPP payments are settled using funds available in the FSS Allocation only. Each settlement request relating to an NPP payment is validated and tested by the FSS against technical criteria and for the availability of sufficient funds in the payer institution's FSS Allocation: • If testing is successful, settlement occurs. The payee institution's FSS Allocation is credited simultaneously with the debiting of the payer institution's FSS Allocation and a settlement confirmation is sent to both institutions. • If a settlement request fails, due to insufficient funds or any other validation error, the NPP payment is rejected, settlement is not completed and a rejection message is returned to the institutions. In order to process and settle payments quickly, it is also not possible to recall NPP payments, since the FSS settles or rejects payments very quickly. RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA BULLETIN – SEPTEMBER 2018 8 Institutions are encouraged to ensure that they always maintain sufficient funds in the FSS for the settlement of NPP payments. The Reserve Bank assists institutions with their liquidity management through the automated system liquidity management tools in RITS (including the FSS) and eligible institutions are able to access funding through the Reserve Bank's Standing Facilities. With the introduction of the FSS, a new liquidity management tool was built into RITS. Through this tool, institutions are able to adjust the amount of funds available in the FSS and RITS Allocations of their ESA by setting upper and lower ‘trigger points’ on their FSS Allocation (Figure 2). When a trigger point is reached, funds are automatically reallocated between the two Allocations of the ESA to a ‘reset point’ set by the institution. Institutions are also able to manually request that their FSS Allocation is returned to their nominated reset point. Figure 2: Movement of ESA Funds The use of upper and lower trigger points to automatically top up or withdraw funds in the FSS Allocation helps ensure that funds are available for both NPP and RITS transactions. However, RITS settlement hours are between 7.30 am and 10 pm on business days, while the FSS settles NPP transactions 24/7, so all ESA funds are transferred to the FSS Allocation when RITS is not operating. The Reserve Bank's existing Standing Facilities, which are available to eligible institutions, can also be used to assist with liquidity management, by making additional ESA funds available on pre- specified terms. The Bank offers intraday repurchase agreements (repos), which carry no interest RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA BULLETIN – SEPTEMBER 2018 9 charge but must be reversed later that day, to help institutions manage their outgoing and incoming payment flows through their ESA. The Bank also provides ‘open’ repos to institutions that would otherwise regularly require intraday repos and institutions that settle DE or FSS payments at times when the cash market is closed (that is, overnight or on weekends). These open repos do not have a fixed maturity date.[3] Participation and connectivity The NPP has been designed to provide a number of ways for entities to leverage the NPP's functionality. ADIs can participate in the NPP by becoming either an ‘NPP participant’ to directly clear and/or settle NPP payments or an ‘identified institution’ by forming an agency arrangement with a ‘sponsor participant’, who clears and/or settles the NPP payments on their behalf. There are already more than 55 banks, credit unions and building societies that are able to offer fast payments to their customers via agency arrangements through ADIs specialising in providing such services. These organisations or NPP participants who provide institutional banking services can also provide access to third parties other than ADIs, such as fintechs or corporates. NPP participants can choose to connect to the NPP Basic Infrastructure by either installing their own payment gateway, arranging to use another NPP participant's payment gateway, or using a third-party payment gateway provider. In future, other classes of organisations without ADI licences called

Introduction and scope These Cyber Fraud Instructions are applied under PART 11 of the HVCS Procedures and it provides instructions and guidance for High Value Clearing System Framework Participants in the event that a Framework Participant experiences or is affected by a Cyber Fraud Event. It is intended to adopt a principles-based approach rather than a prescriptive approach in respect of Cyber Fraud Events. The intention is to set a baseline of operational requirements and expectations to enhance the framework’s ability to deal with suspected and confirmed fraudulent payments. Under Regulation 4.12 of the HVCS Regulations, Framework Participants must provide all reasonable assistance to each other Framework Participant and to the Management Committee to investigate any actual or suspected fraudulent activity involving or possibly involving HVCS and identify the source of any fraudulent activity involving HVCS. These Cyber Fraud Instructions are intended to provide guidance on how Framework Participants can provide such assistance to each other. Framework Participants processing high-value transactions on behalf of a third party should inform users of their services of the obligation to comply with the Procedures and these Cyber Fraud Instructions. There are three classifications of instructions: Rating Definition Must Framework Participants are required to implement all ‘must’ items. These requirements: • refer to the Regulations and other HVCS or SWIFT requirements; • enable Framework Participants to meet their obligations and minimise risk to other members. Should Participants are expected to implement ‘should’ items. These expectations: • provide instructions and guidance on aspects of the Cyber Fraud Event that may vary based on the specifics of a Framework Participant’s systems or operations. Could Participants are encouraged to consider ‘could’ items but are not required to implement them. These considerations: • provide indications of recommended best practice. 2. Relationship with other documents Nothing in these Cyber Fraud Instructions affect a Framework Participant’s obligations to comply with the Procedures or the Framework Participant’s regulatory and framework requirements. 475 Inserted effective 14/11/22, version 041 r&p 001.22 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE K: CYBER FRAUD INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 156 If a provision of these Cyber Fraud Instructions is inconsistent with a provision of the Procedures, the provisions of the Procedures prevail.

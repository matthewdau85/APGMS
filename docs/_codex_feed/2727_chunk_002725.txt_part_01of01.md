Page 1 1 Introduction In response to requests from members of the payment card industry (“PCI”) for a unified set of payment account data security requirements, PCI Security Standards Council, LLC (“PCI SSC”) adopted and maintains the PCI Data Security Standard or “PCI DSS,” a set of requirements for cardholder data protection across the industry. When implemented properly, PCI DSS requirements provide a well-aimed defense for merchants and service providers against data exposure and compromise. As a result, assessment of merchants and service providers for compliance with PCI DSS requirements has become increasingly critical in today’s environment and is key to the success of the PCI DSS. Independent security organizations qualified by PCI SSC to validate an entity’s adherence to PCI DSS requirements are referred to as “Qualified Security Assessor Companies” or “QSA Companies.” Validation of PCI DSS requirements by QSA Companies is important to the effectiveness of the PCI DSS; and the quality, reliability, and consistency of a QSA Company’s work provides confidence that cardholder data is adequately protected. The proficiency with which a QSA Company conducts a PCI DSS Assessment can therefore have a tremendous impact on data protection and the consistent and proper application of PCI DSS measures and controls. This document—the QSA Qualification Requirements—describes the necessary qualifications for security companies and their employees to be qualified by PCI SSC to perform PCI DSS Assessments. In addition to the qualifications offered under the PCI SSC Qualified Security Assessor Program described in this document and related PCI SSC publications (the “QSA Program”), PCI SSC offers the following related assessor qualifications under its corresponding PCI SSC programs: Payment Application – Qualified Security Assessor (PA-QSA), PCI Forensics Investigator (PFI), Qualified Security Assessor for Point-to-Point Encryption (QSA (P2PE)), and Payment Application – Qualified Security Assessor for Point-to-Point Encryption (PA-QSA (P2PE)). Qualification under each of these Programs requires QSA Company qualification and satisfaction of applicable PCI SSC Program-specific requirements. 1.1 Terminology Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this document have the meanings set forth in this Section 1.1, or in the QSA Agreement, as applicable. Term Definition Assessor-Employee A QSA Employee or Associate QSA Employee. Associate QSA Employee An individual who is employed by a QSA Company and has satisfied and continues

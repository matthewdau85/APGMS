legitimate. The SSL certificate demonstrates to your customers that your site is a safe place to conduct e- commerce transactions. In effect, easily verifiable certificates show that your site is to be trustworthy.

Hence self-certification in e-commerce is not recommended.  —Are “SSL Certificates” still OK to use? All the technology, marketing, and instructional literature I see references “SSL Certificates”. What is the difference between an SSL 3.0 certificate and a digital certificate? Most digital certificates are advertised as “SSL Certificates” even if they are not using the SSL protocol. These may be acceptable to use only if they are actually using TLS 1.1 or higher as the security protocol. Also, most offers for “free SSL certificates” refer to domain-validated (DV) certificates, which were covered in Section 4.1, “Certificate Types (DV, OV, EV) and Associated Risks.” DV certs are not recommended for e-commerce transactions. For e-commerce transactions, use OV or EV authenticated SSL/TLS certificates.

It is recommended that a merchant determine roles and responsibilities—for both itself and any third party it chooses to engage for services—for meeting for PCI DSS requirements, as well as due diligence to confirm the third party’s status regarding PCI DSS compliance. The following sections provide more detail on these guidelines. 5.1 E-commerce Solution Validation Merchants should be prepared to ask a number of questions of any prospective e-commerce SP, about how the SP may or may not be compliant against the various PCI standards (PCI DSS, PA-DSS). 5.1.1 PA-DSS Validated Software and Services A PA-DSS validated shopping cart may be one of the tools used for e-commerce. This may include situations where the SP is responsible for the installation, maintenance, and development of the e- commerce platform, including the shopping-cart functionality. In this case, the question should be asked whether the shopping cart has been validated per and can be verified by looking for the software on the PA-DSS Validated Applications listing. Additional questions/assurance should be obtained to ensure the PA-DSS application was installed as per the implementation guide (IG). Expiration dates of the PA-DSS application should be recorded, and updated documentation should be obtained to ensure the PA-DSS application remains on the List of Validated Payment Applications. 5.1.2 Service Provider Validation As per PCI DSS Requirement 12.8.3, the merchant should develop a process to engage service providers. This engagement process should consider validation level of the service provider. While the DSS itself does not set validation levels, the card brands may set guidance on the level of validation required for compliance, for both merchants and service providers. Merchants should look at whether any SP should meet the same level of validation as the merchant must, which may require inquiries to the card brands or acquiring banks. If additional requirements must be met, this may influence the selection of a SP. Additional factors that may influence this decision include the merchant’s appetite for risk, additional internal pressures driving the level of acceptable assurance, and any needs of the merchant’s customers. Ultimately, the merchant is responsible for its PCI DSS compliance, which may be impacted by the SP PCI DSS compliance status, and must therefore exercise careful due diligence. Where service providers have not undertaken their own PCI DSS assessment, the merchant should make sufficient enquiries to understand the security controls the service provider has in place and perform a Note: The PCI SSC Information Supplement, Third-Party Security Assurance, provides much more in- depth information on validation than is outlined below. These guidelines and questions are meant as a companion to that publication. The publication Payment Protection Resources for Small Merchants: Questions to Ask Your Vendors can also provide clarification and additional questions a merchant should ask its e-commerce solution provider.

The outcome of these inquiries should be taken into account before signing any contracts. 5.1.3 Other Validation or Assessments PCI DSS is not the only set of standards that exist for e-commerce and security purposes. If your industry or business requires additional guidelines for a solution, care should be taken to ensure that any provider chosen meets these requirements as well. However, it is important to keep in mind that meeting other security compliance guidelines and security certifications does not guarantee PCI DSS guidelines are met. PCI DSS does not require service providers to undergo a self-assessment or QSA-led PCI DSS assessment. This is an acquirer or payment brand determination. There are multiple

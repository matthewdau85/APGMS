Senate Committee Inquiry into the AML/CTF Amendment Bill Also in October, AusPayNet made a submission to the Senate Committee inquiry into the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) Amendment Bill 2024 . The Bill broadly aligned with the proposals in the Government’s preceding two consultations on reforms to the AML/CTF regime, as well as the key feedback provided in AusPayNet’s submissions to those consultations. Our submission to the inquiry therefore reiterated the feedback that AusPayNet, in consultation with our Policy Experts Group and other Members, provided to the Government on this topic in mid-2023 and mid-2024 . This included highlighting the industry’s strong support for amending the tipping-off offence to enable appropriate private-to-private information sharing across the ecosystem, and the importance of ensuring that the obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 do not impede the implementation of such information sharing arrangements. Consultation on mandatory guardrails for AI in high-risk settings AusPayNet had also made a Management submission to the Government’s proposals paper for introducing mandatory guardrails for AI in high-risk settings. This built on the feedback AusPayNet provided in response to the Department of Industry, Science and Resources’ earlier consultation on safe and responsible AI in Australia in August 2023. Our submission expressed general support for the proposed framework, and particularly its risk-based and principles-driven approach to AI regulation that seeks to balance the need for both consistency and proportionality in regulating the various potential AI use cases across different industries. We also welcomed the Government’s broad alignment with emerging international standards and best practice. The submission provided some further insights and considerations about the proposed guardrails from the perspective of the Australian payments industry, to help inform any further refinements to the governance framework. Tokenisation In June, AusPayNet convened the industry Tokenisation Standards Development Working Group (TSDWG) to support AusPayNet in the drafting of a standard to address some of the potential frictions encountered by merchants wishing to switch payment service providers (PSPs), and to assist the industry in meeting the RBA’s Tokenisation Expectations . The development of this standard is a test case for AusPayNet on its journey to becoming an authorised standards-setting body. The TSDWG has held five meetings and a draft version of the Standard for PSP Porting of Merchant Payment Related Data (Standard) will be issued for wider consultation later this month. Parties invited to participate in the consultation include all entities that are, or potentially could be, involved in the provision or support of services that port/transfer merchant payment-related data either to or from a PSP. Consultation will run until the end of January 2025. Subject to the consultation feedback, AusPayNet is aiming to present the final Standard for approval by the AusPayNet Board in Q2 2025. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) migration program The technical blueprint, migration strategy and industry testing strategy are progressing well and due to be finalised this month. The focus will turn to further developing the plans for an industry pilot and supporting participants with their respective programs in 2025. Australia continues to be a leading jurisdiction in migrating to AES, with the mandate supported by government, regulators, and industry bodies. Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS) The setting of a conditional target end-date of 2030 for the BECS Framework has generated positive and constructive discussions and initiatives in the industry. These discussions and initiatives will assist AusPayNet to assess the validity of the target end-date against the agreed industry readiness criteria: Viability of BECS alternatives Member readiness to transition End-use adoption BECS membership and volume changes. Some of these initiatives, such as Treasury's targeted consultation on bulk payments and the RBA's Account-to-Account Pricing Study, aim to further explore the challenges associated with a transition off BECS, particularly for end-users; other initiatives, by BECS members and providers of modern BECS alternatives, aim to facilitate BECS members' increased adoption of BECS alternative payment rails. As the custodian of the BECS Framework, AusPayNet is closely monitoring these initiatives, in addition to performing our own: Control the future of the framework We will continually test the validity of the target end-date based on industry’s progress to transition BECS use cases off the BECS Framework. To support AusPayNet in this activity, an industry working group has been convened, with representatives of BECS Tier 1 and Tier 2 Members. The first output of this working group is a member information request that was issued to all BECS members this month, requesting data on our Members' readiness to transition off BECS. The aggregated findings from this information request and data obtained from BECS-related Payment System Market Share (PSMS) and other BECS-related industry initiatives, will inform AusPayNet's updates on the target end-date for the Framework to its Members and key stakeholders. Collaborate with industry We continue to collaborate with regulators and industry participants on the BECS transition-related initiatives. In September, the RBA hosted a webinar with financial institutions (attended by AusPayNet) to provide the initial observations of the RBA’s BECS Transition Risk Assessment and next steps. Coordinate the migration The process for transitioning away from BECS presents complex challenges for the industry, challenges that cannot be effectively or efficiently addressed by any one industry participant working alone. Recognising this, we have consulted with industry participants and regulators in relation to potential industry-wide coordination to work towards a desired end state for account-to-account payments in Australia. Subject to regulatory approvals, the scope of potential coordination and desired end state will be

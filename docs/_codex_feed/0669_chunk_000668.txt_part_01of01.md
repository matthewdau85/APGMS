same key should not be derived for multiple devices, except by chance. 8 B.3.8 Controls are in place to detect the unauthorized replacement of a Terminal or PED previously removed from a facility.81 31 B.3.9 Upon inspection of a device, where there is any evidence of tampering or doubt about tampering, the acquirer shall be notified immediately. B.4 Key Loading (KLD) / Key Transport Devices (KTD) A KLD is an SCD used to load plain text keys into an SCD outside of the KIF, i.e., load keys into a PED in the field. A KTD is an SCD used to transfer keys between an SCD in the KIF and an external SCD. The keys may be moved in either direction. KIF Requirements Ref B.4.1 Keys shall not be installed in any KLD/KTD until it has been inspected by qualified staff and a reasonable degree of assurance has been reached that the SCD is an authentic device and has not been subject to any unauthorised physical or logical modifications or substitution. This assurance may take the form of, but not limited to, one or more of the following methods using approved guidelines from the supplier on how this is to be done: Physical inspection and/or testing of the equipment immediately prior to key loading; and Physical protection of the equipment. (e.g., bonded carrier, device authentication code injected by Terminal vendor and verified on receipt, tamper evident packaging, etc.). 2 81 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 38 KIF Requirements Ref B.4.2 A KLD/KTD shall be an approved SCD designed for the purpose of transporting keys outside the KIF. 47 B.4.3 The KLD/KTD shall not retain a key or, information that may disclose that key, that it has successfully transferred. 47 B.4.4 The KLD will not output any key except when under dual control. Such dual control is enforced by means such as the following: the device requires that at least two passwords be correctly entered within a period of no more than five minutes, before the device will output a key; the device requires that at least two different, non-reproducible physical keys be concurrently inserted into the unit before it will output a key. 49 B.4.5 Controls are in place to ensure the destruction of any old keys from a KLD/KTD returned to the KIF prior to the injection of new keys. B.4.6 No person with existing or prior access to any mechanism used to enforce dual control on the KLD/KTD (e.g., password or physical key) has existing, prior, or future access to any other mechanism used to enforce dual control on that device. 23 & 51 B.4.7 If the KLD/KTD only requires tamper evidence then, when the device is not in active use, undetected access to its internal circuitry is prevented by means such as the following: the facility where the KLD/KTD operates has sufficient supervision and controls to detect any such unauthorized access to the KLD/KTD before the device is subsequently put into active use; the KLD/KTD is stored under dual control, in a tamper-evident cabinet for which each incident of opening and closing is controlled and recorded, under dual control; the tamper-evident cabinet, if used, is regularly monitored by at least two trusted people who are qualified to detect and able to observe any unauthorised access. 52 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 39 KIF Requirements Ref B.4.8 If the KLD/KTD only requires tamper evidence then, when the KLD is in or ready for active use, undetected access to its internal circuitry is prevented by means such as the following: the facility where the KLD/KTD operates has sufficient supervision and controls to detect any such unauthorized access to the KLD/KTD before the KLD/KTD is subsequently used for any cryptographic function; the KLD/KTD is under the continuous supervision of at least two trusted people who are qualified to detect and able to observe any such access. 53 B.4.9 The KLD/KTD is loaded with a plaintext key only under the direct supervision of at least two authorized people, both of whom ensure that there is no “bug” or other disclosing mechanism in the path that the key traverses from the key generation device to the KLD/KTD. 58 B.4.10 The KLD is used to inject a plaintext key into a cryptographic device only under the direct supervision of at least two authorized people, both of whom ensure that there is no “bug” or other disclosing mechanism on the path that the key traverses from the KLD to the target device. 50 B.4.11 Use of any KLD/KTD shall be monitored and a log of all key-loading activities maintained for audit purposes. 59 B.5 General Key Management KIF Requirements Ref B.5.1 Keys shall exist only in those forms permitted by these requirements. 6 B.5.2 Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure secret or private keys shall be generated using a process such that it is not possible to predict any secret value or to determine that certain values are more probable than others from the total set of all the possible values. 10 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B.

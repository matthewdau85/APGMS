Make sure your payment terminals are secure before you close your shop for the day, including any devices that read your customers’ payment cards or accept their personal identific tion numbers (PINs). CONTROL REPAIRS. Only allow payment terminal repairs from authorized repair personnel, and only if you are expecting them. Tell your staff too.

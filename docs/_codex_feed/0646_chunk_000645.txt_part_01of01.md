See 3.1 (a) IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 3 PIN USAGE OVER OPEN NETWORKS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 18 the PIN distribution system should perform no other function than PIN distribution and any sessions established during the distribution should be terminated once the PIN has been sent; the association of the PIN to a specific account or card number should not be possible with the authorising information available on the PIN distribution system; where required, the PIN distribution system should decrypt the PIN immediately prior to transmission to the Cardholder; it should not be possible to identify the type of Cardholder payment device, account or card number from the SMS message containing the PIN. PIN advice by internet (Issuer assigned PIN) In addition to the recommendations set out in clause 3.4.1, the recommendations set out below should be followed where the PIN is communicated to the Cardholder using the internet:45 Issuers should provide the Cardholder with security advice for the management of the end-user device (e.g., PC, Smartphone, etc.) used for PIN advice. This should include advice about the dangers of malware and of storing account data e.g., Cardholder statements and/or PINs on the end-user device or any additional copies made of the data e.g., backups; the PIN should be cryptographically protected whilst in storage or transmission using strong encryption46. PIN transmission should be in accordance with the recommendations in clause 3.7 ;47 the encrypted PIN should be decrypted for display on the end-user device's display by the Issuer-provided application; initiation of the PIN advice should require that the Cardholder enter pre- established credentials such as a control number and authentication value; as the security of the PIN advice implementation is based on the premise that no individual, other than the Cardholder, can associate the control number with a specific account or card number, it is essential that the pre- established credentials should not disclose the card or account numbers; if control numbers and authentication values are used then the control number and authentication values should be communicated using an out- of-band mechanism i.e., through the use of two separate networks working simultaneously to authenticate a user; any key used to generate a control number should not be used for any other purpose and shall be managed in accordance with AS 2805.6.1; 45 Last amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 46 See 3.1(a) 47 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 3 PIN USAGE OVER OPEN NETWORKS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 19 the PIN, and if control numbers and authentication values are used, then the authentication values as well, should not be logged and should be deleted immediately after use; if control numbers and authentication values are used then issuers should ensure that the association of Cardholder authentication credentials with a control number does not weaken the principle that the control number cannot be used to determine a specific account or card number; if control numbers and authentication are used then Cardholder authentication should not be performed by the Internet server but rather by the back end Issuer host system and only after the control number has been re-associated with a specific account; web servers should be configured to disable client side caching of web pages that display PIN and associated data during the Internet session. if control numbers and authentication values are used then the control number should be generated and delivered to the Cardholder in such a way, e.g., by using a tamper evident mailer, such that no-one, other than Cardholder, can associate that control number with that Cardholder without detection; if control numbers and authentication values are used then the control number should be communicated to the Cardholder in such a way that no- one, other than the Cardholder, can access it without detection; if control numbers and authentication values are used then the PIN distribution system should have no way of associating a control number with a specific Cardholder’s name, address, account, card or phone numbers; if control numbers and authentication values are used then the PIN advice function should exchange only strings of numbers (a control number and authentication values) with the Issuer PIN distribution system i.e., there should be no other Cardholder identifying information, other than the control number, exchanged during the PIN delivery function; if control numbers and authentication values are used then the PIN management system should re-associate the control number with a specific account number, validate the Cardholder using the authentication values and retrieve the Cardholder PIN for that account number; if control numbers and authentication values are used then the PIN distribution system should be designed and operated under strictly enforced conditions such that no individual, other than the Cardholder, is able to associate a control number, PIN or authentication values with any specific card or account number; if control numbers and authentication values are used then PIN delivery to the end-user equipment (e.g., PC or smart-phone) should not be associated with any Cardholder account data or card number; IAC CODE SET VOLUME 2 - ISSUERS CODE PART 3 PIN USAGE OVER OPEN NETWORKS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 20 internet PIN advice should be protected using a secure channel established between the client application and the PIN distribution system according to the principles

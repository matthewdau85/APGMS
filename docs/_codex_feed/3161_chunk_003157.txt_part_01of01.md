UNDERSTANDING YOUR RISK Understanding your risk As a small business, you are a prime target for data thieves. When your payment card data is breached, the fallout can strike quickly. Your customers lose trust in your ability to protect their personal information. They take their business elsewhere. There are potential financial penalties and damages from lawsuits, and your business may lose the ability to accept payment cards. A survey of 1,015 small and medium businesses found 60% of those breached close in six months.

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of security requirements that can help small merchants to protect customer card data located on payment cards. Small merchants may be familiar with validating their PCI DSS compliance via a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ). For more information on PCI DSS, see the Resources at the end of this guide. TYPES OF DATA ON A PAYMENT CARD Chip PAN Cardholder name Expiration date Magnetic stripe (Data on tracks 1 and 2) Card security code (American Express) Card security code (All other payment brands) YOUR CUSTOMERS’ CARD DATA IS A GOLD MINE FOR CRIMINALS. DON’T LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU! Follow the actions in this guide to protect against data theft. Examples of payment card data are the primary account number (PAN) and three or four-digit card security code. The red arrows below point to types of data that require protection. 5 A PAYMENT SYSTEM includes the entire process for accepting card payments. Also called the cardholder data environment (CDE), your payment system may include a payment terminal, an electronic cash register, other devices or systems connected to a payment terminal (for example, Wi-Fi for connectivity or a PC used for inventory), and the connections out to a merchant bank. It is important to use only secure payment terminals and solutions to support your payment system. See page 22 for more information.

Point-of-sale (or POS) terminal, credit card machine, PDQ terminal, or EMV/chip- enabled terminal are also names used to describe these devices. ENCRYPTION (or cryptography) makes card data unreadable to people without special information (called a key). Cryptography can be used on stored data and data transmitted over a network. Payment terminals that are part of a PCI-listed P2PE solution provide merchants the best assurance about the quality of the encryption. With a PCI-listed P2PE solution, card data is always entered directly into a PCI-approved payment terminal with something called “secure reading and exchange of data (SRED)” enabled. This approach minimizes risk to clear-text card data and protects merchants against payment-terminal exploits such as “memory scraping” malware. Any encryption that is not done within a PCI-listed P2PE should be discussed with your vendor. Accepting face-to-face card payments from your customers requires special equipment. Depending on where in the world you are located, equipment used to take payments is called by different names. Here are the types we reference in this document and what they are commonly called. A MERCHANT BANK is a bank or financial institution th t processes credit and/or debit card payments on behalf of merchants. Acquirer, acquiring bank, and card or payment processor are also terms for this entity. An INTEGRATED PAYMENT TERMINAL is a payment terminal and electronic cash register in one, meaning it takes payments, registers and calculates transactions, and prints receipts. An ELECTRONIC CASH REGISTER (or till) registers and calculates transactions, and may print out receipts, but it does not accept customer card payments. 6 Data Security Essentials for Small Merchants: Guide to Safe Payments Copyright 2024 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

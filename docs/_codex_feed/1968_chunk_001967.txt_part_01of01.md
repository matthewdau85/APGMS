A business or organisation will set up a PayTo agreement with you. This could be for a one-off, ad hoc or recurring payment. You can choose to use your PayID (mobile number or email address) or BSB and account number. Some businesses may only accept certain PayID types, like a mobile PayID. Next, the agreement will be sent to your online banking for you to review and authorise. The agreement will include all relevant payment terms such as amount, purpose, and frequency. You should check that the information in the agreement matches what you have agreed with, then authorise the agreement. Once a PayTo agreement has been authorised, the business or organisation can only debit your account in accordance with the agreed payment terms. That means you're in control of how much money can be debited.

any PCI SSC Standard. 40 6.6 Additional Considerations Entities may also be subject to rules from regional regulatory bodies or legal requirements that impact how they manage telephone payments. A few examples: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the European Union data-protection and privacy regulation; the U.S. Federal Act, Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), also known as the "Digital Telephony Act"; the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK regulates banks, mutual societies, and financial advisers to protect customers and promote fair competition. An example of impact on merchants is that those using DTMF masking/suppression for their telephone payments may also be required to accept some telephone payments verbally to support customers with disabilities or who are otherwise unable to pay by pressing their telephone keypad. Entities with these obligations will need to implement appropriate processes and technologies to secure all account data that is received verbally by call agents and systems during processing and remove all SAD upon completion of the transaction. Entities need to understand how different technology deployments impact the data captured in call and screen recordings, and the controls that will be consequently needed to protect CHD and remove SAD from the recordings. For example:  Recordings will capture clear-text CHD and SAD if spoken by the cardholder or captured through DTMF tones, and where the entire conversation is recorded.  Recordings will not capture CHD or SAD if DTMF masking/suppression is implemented prior to the data reaching recording systems (when DTMF is the only acceptance channel).  Recordings may capture CHD or SAD if pause-and-resume is used, depending on the accuracy of the pause-and-resume process. In order to meet PCI DSS, controls should be in place to ensure that SAD is either not recorded or, if it is recorded, that it is securely deleted immediately upon authorization of the transaction. Where an entity has failed to prevent the storage of SAD after authorization, the business MUST take all possible steps to immediately delete SAD. Additionally, analysis of the failure should be performed, and corrective measures identified and implemented to prevent the failure reoccurring. If SAD contained within audio recordings can be digitally queriedif SAD is easily accessibleit must not be stored. If these recordings cannot be data mined, storage of SAD after authorization may be permissible as long as appropriate validation has been performed. This includes the physical and logical protections defined in PCI DSS that must still be applied to these call-recording formats. For further information on call recording, see Appendix D, “Call Recording Decision-making Process.” Consideration should also be given to the organization’s backup, failover, and disaster-recovery (DR) processes—for example, how is account data handled if the DTMF-masking or pause-and-resume technology fails? What are the alternative processes if payments cannot be taken via the primary telephone channels? Is the DR approach PCI DSS compliant? In all cases, the business needs to ensure that appropriate PCI DSS processes and controls are in place to secure the CDE and any other in-scope systems.

The deployment of data-discovery tools can be useful in determining where CHD and potentially SAD exists. Further considerations should be given to monitoring the effectiveness of the controls with, in particular, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), including leak detection and protection. A system adapted to the environment that can be considered as DLP may involve a multitude of technologies from basic firewall access control to specialized systems using data fingerprinting.

In the context of telephone-based payment card data, third- party relationships often include IVR providers, call-handling companies, call centers, hosting providers, technical support and maintenance providers, contact centers, and/or customer service providers. The definition of service providers is available in Section 2.4. An important consideration is that a telecommunications company providing just the communication link would not be considered a service provider for that service. This means that a carrier providing only ISDN lines and SIP trunks, with no additional services, may not have any PCI DSS responsibilities. In this scenario, the entity or service provider would consider the carrier network a public or untrusted network, and applicable PCI DSS controls would need to be in place to protect account data transmitted over such networks. Carriers or other entities providing services such as call center services, call-recording technologies, call-recording storage, hosting of call-recording technologies, or other functionality that impacts account data would be considered service providers for PCI DSS purposes. When looking at a telecommunication company’s services, organizations should have a clear understanding of the details of the services being provided—including where scope begins and ends and the demarcation points of those services. For example, two telecommunications companies might provide what appears to be the same service (telephone connectivity), with

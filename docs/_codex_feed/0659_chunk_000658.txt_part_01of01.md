here described, may also be used where required:42 (i) A format 8 PIN block may be used where a PIN Block is required but no PIN is available. The PIN block is constructed by the modulo 2 addition of two 64-bit fields formatted as follows:43 1. a plain text field44 Bit 1 5 9 13 17 21 25 29 33 37 41 45 49 53 57 61 64 C N R R R R R R R R R R R R F F and; 2. the account number field45 Bit 1 5 9 13 17 21 25 29 33 37 41 45 49 53 57 61 64 0 0 0 0 A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 A9 A10 A11 A12 Where:46 C = Control Field • 1000 (binary) N = PIN length • 0000 (binary) R = Random digit • 4-bit binary field with each occurrence being randomly chosen form the range 0000 (zero) to 1111 (fifteen). • The resultant 48-bit random number shall be unique (except by chance) for each occurrence of a format 8 PIN block. • The random number shall not be transmitted in the clear. F = Fill digit • 1111 (binary) 0 = Pad digit • 0000 (binary) A1 to A12 = Account number • Content is the 12 right-most digits of the primary account number (PAN) in 4-bit binary representation, excluding the check digit. • A12 is the digit immediately preceding the PAN’s check digit. • If the PAN excluding the check digit is less than 12 digits, the digits are right justified and padded to the left with 0000 (zero). 42 Amended effective 21/11/16, version 004 r&p 002.16 43 Inserted effective 21/11/16, version 004 r&p 002.16 44 Inserted effective 21/11/16, version 004 r&p 002.16 45 Inserted effective 21/11/16, version 004 r&p 002.16 46 Inserted effective 21/11/16, version 004 r&p 002.16 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE PART 3 –DEVICE SECURITY Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 14 • Permissible values are 0000 (zero) to 1001 (nine) and; use only those hash algorithms specified in ISO TR-14742 Recommendations on Cryptographic Algorithms and their Use – Technical Report. Those algorithms must be implemented in accordance with the guidelines given in that technical report. 3.2.2 PIN Entry Devices PIN entry devices must be managed in accordance with the requirements of AS 2805.14 series. The Sponsor will submit to the Management Committee an annual compliance statement confirming compliance with Annexes A.3 and B.3 of AS 2805.14.2 in respect of any PEDs employed in generating Interchange Transactions, Annexure B of IAC Code Set Volume 1 (Introduction and Member Obligations), provides the required confirmation. 3.2.3 Privacy Shielding47 Where the device is designed and to be installed such that the device can be picked up and shielded from monitoring by the user's own body, or where the device, in itself, does not provide sufficient shielding and reliance is placed on the external physical environment, the Acquirer must ensure that the device is installed and managed in conformance with any vendor supplies rules and guidance as to how the visual observation is to be deterred. 3.2.4 TCP/IP Terminal connectivity48 The following requirements apply to all Terminals where TCP/IP protocols are used for communications. Terminal identification is mandatory and may be implemented in part (at the financial message protocol level) by using a (Terminal resident) MAC address as a (Terminal) serial number or the PIN Pad Identification Definition (PPID). Mutual authentication is mandatory and may be implemented at the network / transport layer (e.g., SSL, IPSec, et al) or at financial message layer (e.g., AS2805.6.5 series). Transport level message encipherment must be applied to the entire datagram encapsulating the financial message unless the Terminal is located on an Acquirer controlled private network.49 47 Amended effective 16/12/21, version 013 r&p 001.21 48 Amended effective 1/1/19, version 008 r&p 002.18 49 Amended effective 21/11/16, version 004 r&p 002.16 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE PART 3 –DEVICE SECURITY Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 15 End-to-end financial message encipherment must be provided using a method conformant to AS 2805.9. All operating systems must be hardened. The Terminal must contain a firewall if it is based on a ‘general purpose computer’. The Terminal must support a malware scanning application if it is based on a general purpose computer. No software on the Terminal will listen on any network service port, i.e., Terminal software may initiate “connect out” sessions only. The Terminal must support an active patch management process (to ensure that both the operating system and application environment is kept current and up to date to minimise exposure to any discovered flaws in those environments). The Terminal must, at a minimum, support 3DES encryption with full message encryption and authentication. Only unique key per Transaction or dynamic session keys are permitted for Terminal key management. Terminals with dynamic session key changes (application level) are required to change session keys every 256 Transactions or once per hour, whichever occurs first. Any remote support of merchant network and Terminals must be via a correctly configured and secured, remote access system.50 The Terminal application software must be secured against unauthorised changes or substitution. 3.2.5 Terminals Running Multiple Applications51 The following requirements apply to all Approved Devices running multiple applications including non-payment applications. The Terminal shall meet the requirements of clause 3.2.4(e) to 3.2.4(i). The Terminal payment

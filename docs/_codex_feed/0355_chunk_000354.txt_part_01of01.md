GUIDELINES FOR DESIGNING AND PROCURING ACCESSIBLE PIN ENTRY ON TOUCHSCREEN TERMINALS Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals 12 ➜ Key Recommendations When designing for accessibility, and to enhance the ability of users to independently enter their PINs on touchscreen terminals, it is strongly recommended that the following factors should be included in the design and procurement process. In general, best practice is that multiple or alternate means of achieving any given outcome should be provided and should deliver equality and/or equivalence of user experience. The keypad • Where reasonable, include a tactile keypad as an alternative method for entering the PIN. • If a virtual keypad is used (a keypad that is displayed on the screen), it is recommended that it be placed with the ‘5’ in the centre of the screen, and adopts the layout of ‘1,2,3 / 4,5,6 / 7,8,9 / Cancel, 0, OK’. The keypad should stay static (not move around) and centralised. • Provide haptic and audio feedback to provide a virtual indication that the ‘5’ has been selected, to simulate the functionality of the raised button on tactile keypads, while ensuring that the PIN selection is not disclosed in the process. • Provide non-visual haptic and audio feedback to indicate that different numbers have been selected and, where appropriate, entered as the user moves across the keypad to select their PIN. The feedback should indicate how many digits have been entered so users can keep track of where they are up to with completing the entry of their PIN. • None of these indicators should have variations in tone that could be used to identify any particular digit of the PIN. Accessibility mode • Accessibility mode should be able to be turned on in a variety of ways, which could include, but are not limited to: o a physical button with a tactile means of location and identification so it can be turned on easily and independently by the user, so as not to rely solely on the merchant. o a distinct gesture, such as a single-finger (or stylus) double-tap on any part of the touchscreen. o tapping a recognisable symbol for accessibility displayed on the device screen. o insertion of headphones into the audio jack. o reading and activating an individual user’s preferences e.g. for accessibility mode, from the payment token presented if such a feature is available. • A headphone jack should be provided, with a tactile means of location. Plugging in a headphone should automatically activate accessibility mode. • All terminals should be capable of using speech output to provide instructions, feedback as the transaction progresses, status information, error messages, and helpful prompts. Speech output should be automatically established when either accessibility mode is activated or headphones are inserted. • Feedback to the user in this mode should be either audible, haptic, or preferably both. • Once accessibility mode is activated, the first step is to get to the PIN entry quickly and simply, however it should also provide easy-to-access menu options for either help or further personalisation to individual preferences of e.g. audio volume, font size, screen lighting and contrast, choice of different colour palettes, haptic strength etc. 2. GUIDELINES FOR DESIGNING AND PROCURING ACCESSIBLE PIN ENTRY ON TOUCHSCREEN TERMINALS Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals 13 • The ability to zoom the screen in and out should be provided. This may be achieved through numerous ways, including but not limited to: o a ‘pinch to zoom’ gesture. o an accessibility mode menu to control the font and button size. o tapping a ‘zoom in’ and ‘zoom out’ button on the screen. • The ability to move the screen around should be provided when the screen is zoomed in. • In accessibility mode, the device should read out all information on the screen to the user that a fully sighted person would be able to see, including payment amount and payment progress status (except for the PIN number), as well as when any buttons are selected and tapped by the user. • The ability to repeat the audio feedback at any stage of the payment flow, if required, should be provided. • Once accessibility mode is activated, it should stay on for the duration of the transaction. On completion, accessibility mode should automatically deactivate, resetting to standard mode for the next customer. • Rollout of all devices should be accompanied by a user guide and training for merchants, including regular reminders about educating any new staff, particularly in retail environments where team members may turn-over regularly. PIN Security • To meet the security standards relating to PIN entry, under no circumstances should any digit of the PIN, or the completed PIN, be displayed or announced. However, audible and/or haptic confirmation of the successful entry of each digit of a PIN (but not the number itself) may be provided. Refer to the AusPayNet Issuers & Acquirers Regulations and Code Set for further details regarding PIN security requirements.

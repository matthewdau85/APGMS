the direct supervision of at least two authorized people, both of whom ensure that there is no “bug” or other disclosing mechanism on the path that the key traverses from the KLD to the target device. 50 B.4.11 Use of any KLD/KTD shall be monitored and a log of all key-loading activities maintained for audit purposes. 59 B.5 General Key Management KIF Requirements Ref B.5.1 Keys shall exist only in those forms permitted by these requirements. 6 B.5.2 Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure secret or private keys shall be generated using a process such that it is not possible to predict any secret value or to determine that certain values are more probable than others from the total set of all the possible values. 10 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 40 KIF Requirements Ref B.5.3 A person with access to one component of a key, or to the media conveying this component, shall not have access to any other component of this key or to any other medium conveying any other component of this key. 9 & 63 B.5.4 Functionality needed to import, export, or transfer cryptographic keys from external sources ensures that the keys are in one or more of the following forms: enciphered under the proper variant of a symmetric key encipherment key; enciphered under the asymmetric public key of the recipient; enciphered with an import key being specifically enabled for a limited time and limited number of function calls; as key components managed under dual control, such that two operators are required to perform any key operation; input under dual or multiple control through the secure operator interface, in components such that full knowledge of all but one component gives no usable information on any bit of the cryptographic key; public keys are entered under dual control or enciphered under the a KLD or a target device as per these requirements; Output as clear text keys under dual or multiple control for injection into a KLD or a target device as per these requirements; Output as clear text keys under dual or multiple control for injection into a KLD or a target device as per these requirements. 15 & 62 B.5.5 The transfer of a key to another SCD: uses a secure communications path; or uses a key transfer device; or uses a secure cryptographic path; or is carried out in a secure environment. 4 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 41 KIF Requirements Ref B.5.6 Storage of the private key requires that secrecy and integrity are ensured. Storage of the public key requires that authenticity and integrity are ensured. 77 B.5.7 Plaintext private and secret key(s) whose compromise would affect only one party shall exist only within a SCD or a physically secure environment operated by, or on behalf of, that party under dual control and split knowledge. 60 B.5.8 Plaintext private and secret key(s) whose compromise would affect multiple parties shall exist only within a SCD. 61 B.5.9 Transport of public keys shall be conveyed in a manner that protects their integrity and authenticity and provides the ability to validate that the correct key was received. The mechanism used to validate that the correct public key was received shall be independent of the actual conveyance method. 62 B.5.10 Key confirmation is often provided by subsequent use of an established key, and if something is wrong with its use then it is immediately detected. This is called implicit key confirmation. Explicit key confirmation in this case may be unnecessary. 80 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 3 - ACQUIRERS CODE ANNEXURE B. KEY INJECTION REQUIREMENTS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 42 KIF Requirements Ref B.5.11 One or more of the following techniques shall be used to ensure public key integrity: sign the public key and associated data using a digital signature system, thereby creating a public key certificate. Key certificates, and the management of the keys used to create and verify the certificates, are described in Reference 10, Clauses 5.3 and 6 (see KIF Audit Guide); create a MAC for the public key and associated data, using an algorithm defined by ISO 16609 and a key used only for this purpose; store the public key in an SCD; distribute the public key over an unprotected channel, and distribute a key verification code of the public key and associated data over an integrity assured channel such as an authenticated channel with dual controls (key verification is described in Reference 10, Clause 5.5 - see KIF Audit Guide); using authenticated encryption; when entering the public key into an SCD it shall be managed under dual control. 78 B.5.12 The devices (SCDs) involved in using public key schemes shall check the validity of other such devices involved in the communication prior to any key transport, exchange or establishment. Validation of authentication credentials shall occur immediately prior to any key establishment. 87 B.5.13 Any single clear text key component is, at all times during its transmission, conveyance, or movement between any two organizational entities: under the continuous supervision of a person with authorized access to this component; or locked in a security container (including tamper evident packaging) in such a way that it can

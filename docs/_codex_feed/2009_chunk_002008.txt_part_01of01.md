PURPOSE AND SCOPE We are committed to fostering a culture where you feel safe to speak up about things that concern you. We take your concerns seriously and you are encouraged to confidentially make a report knowing that you have rights to protection from reprisal in accordance with this policy. The purpose of this policy is to: 1. Encourage speaking up – encourage reporting of behaviour that does not feel quite right whether that is illegal conduct or behaviour that is not in line with our values or code of conduct; 2. Reporting a concern – explain how to report a concern and how the concern will be investigated; 3. Protection and support – explain when a report is a protected disclosure and how we will support you; and 4. Governance – ensure AP+ Group meet its legal and regulatory obligations in relation to whistleblower protections. 2. WHO DOES THIS POLICY APPLY TO? This policy applies to current or former: • employees (full time, part time or casual employees); • directors, company secretary or other company officers; • contractors, consultants, supplier and service providers (including their employees, directors and company officers); • associates, trustees, custodians and investment managers; and • relatives, spouses or dependents of any of the people referred to above; of the Australian Payments Plus Limited ACN 649 744 203 and any of its subsidiaries (referred to as AP+ Group or we).

Each person referred to above is considered an Eligible Person under this policy. 3. DISCLOSURES COVERED UNDER THIS POLICY What types of concerns you can report? You can report the following types of conduct: • misconduct or an improper state of affairs: o fraud or theft (e.g. falsifying documentation, misappropriating funds); o corrupt or unethical behaviour (e.g. dishonestly taking advantage of an employment position or breach of the code of conduct); o illegal activity (e.g. laundering money, sexual assault, misreporting financial information, selling and use of illicit drugs, violent behaviour); o a serious or systemic breach of internal policies or code of conduct (e.g. sexual harassment, failure to disclosure conflicts of interest); o a breach of duty or negligent acts; Australian Payments Plus Limited ABN 19 649 744 203 Confidential | 4 • conduct which indicates a significant risk to the stability or confidence in the financial system or to public safety; • conduct which constitutes an offence or breach of the following laws or an instrument made under these laws: o the Corporations Act 2001; o the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001; o the Banking Act 1959; o the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001; o the Insurance Act 1973; o the Life Insurance Act 1995; o the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009; o the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993; or • conduct which constitutes an offence against any other law of the Commonwealth that is punishable by imprisonment for a period of 12 months or more; • indicates an attempt to cover up any of the above conduct; Each type of conduct referred to above is considered Reportable Conduct under this policy. If the Reportable Conduct meets the criteria set out in section 5, you will have protections under this policy and also under specific legislation. 4. DISCLOSURE NOT COVERED BY THIS POLICY Disclosures that relate solely to personal work-related grievances are not usually Whistleblower Disclosures1 under this policy. A personal work-related grievance: • relates to your current or former employment with AP+ Group; • does not have significant implications for the AP+ Group; and • does not concern conduct, or alleged contravention of a Reportable Conduct. However, there may be times when a disclosure of a work-related grievance can still be treated as a Reportable Conduct. This is where: • the disclosure is about detrimental treatment, or the threat of detrimental treatment, you have suffered as a consequence of making, or proposing to make, a disclosure of a Reportable Conduct; • the disclosure has significant implications for the AP+ Group and the information suggests misconduct beyond your personal circumstances; • the disclosure also includes information of Reportable Conduct (a mixed disclosure); or • the disclosure is made to a legal practitioner for the purposes of seeking legal advice or representation about the operation of the whistleblower laws. 1 As defined in section 5.a of this policy.

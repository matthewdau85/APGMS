MICR quality assurance procedures are intended to ensure that the information printed on a document is correct, in the proper positions and meets the requirements for print quality as detailed in this Publication. It is also important to note that the specifications are based on optical and magnetic characteristics. Whilst a Financial Institution may track its performance using the reject rate from its reader/sorters this is not, in isolation, an appropriate method to quality check MICR encoded documents. As outlined earlier, there are a number of technologies employed to manufacture reader/sorters, and no one of these can be considered characteristic of all reader/sorters. The specifications thus apply equally to the documents and the reader/sorters. 7.1 Accreditation of MICR Printing Technology An accreditation process for evaluating MICR Printing Technology was introduced in January 1998 and is set out in Appendix 3 of this publication. The purpose of this accreditation is to protect the clearing system from being presented with large numbers of poor quality MICR documents. Accreditation indicates that a Printing System, when operated in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications, is capable of producing acceptable MICR encoding and has passed the tests outlined in Appendix 3 of this publication. Because of operating and manufacturing variances, accreditation is not a guarantee that a Printing System will produce acceptable results. Hence the quality assurance procedures detailed in this section must be followed to ensure continuing conformance. 7.2 Evaluation Samples For commercial cut sheet and continuous MICR printing, evaluation samples must be supplied to the issuing Financial Institution for every print run of MICR encoded documents unless a contractual arrangement is in place between a Financial Institution and a Printer. The following sampling plan must be followed for printing cheques and deposit forms, and regardless of the printing technology used.  One sample form at the start of the run  One sample every 5,000 to 6,000 forms  One sample at the completion of the run When printing is in a continuous form, this plan can be modified to submit the intermediate samples at reel or pack changes, or other natural break in production. For jobs in excess of 100, 000 forms, Printers should consult the issuing Financial Institution for their requirements that may vary from those outlined above. Where numbering boxes are used, the sample plan relates to the number of boxes used. One sample is to be taken from each box at the sample point. One set is taken at the start and finish of the run. For in-house users of desk-top MICR printers an initial set of about 20 MICR documents must be submitted to the relevant Financial Institution. Ongoing sampling requirements will depend on the volume printed and arrangements should be agreed with the Financial Institution.

This is the simplest, most valuable tool for visual quality control. 7.3.2 Optical Comparator Low powered (12 x magnification), hand held loupes that have a built in reticule containing various optical overlays. The names of suppliers are available from AusPayNet. A linear scale, skew scale, tolerance bands for character alignment, the grid of 0.010 inch squares, and various sized squares are included on the reticule. The comparator can be placed over

With the upcoming retirement of PCI DSS v3.2.1 on 31 March 2024 , organizations will be transitioning to new validation documents for their PCI DSS v4 assessments. In this Q&A with PCI Security Standards Council’s Director of Data Security Standards Lauren Holloway, we look at some of the key changes in the PCI DSS Self-Assessment Questionnaires (SAQs) for version 4 and what organizations using SAQs need to know. How have the SAQs changed for PCI DSS v4? The SAQs have been updated to reflect the PCI DSS v4 requirements updates, so that the requirement wording in the SAQs now mirrors that which is used in the standard, and the SAQ reporting responses are aligned with the PCI DSS v4 Report on Compliance template. Additionally, each SAQ contains new guidance to support organizations completing the self-assessment process. For more details about general changes made to all SAQs, see SAQ Instructions and Guidelines - Appendix A: How SAQs Changed for PCI DSS v4.0 . Have requirements been added to the SAQs? Yes, all SAQs include additional requirements for PCI DSS v4 to ensure the SAQ continues to address the evolving threat landscape. Some of the additional requirements are noted as being best practices until 31 March 2025, after which they must be fully considered as part of a PCI DSS v4 assessment. Before 31 March 2025, future-dated requirements that are not yet implemented can be marked as "Not Applicable" and documented in Appendix C: Explanation of Requirements Noted as Not Applicable in the SAQ. Many of the additional requirements are effective immediately for PCI DSS v4 assessments. Examples of requirements added to each SAQ are summarized below. Note: This is not an all-inclusive list of new requirements. The following provides an overview of the control areas addressed by the additional requirements. Please review the relevant SAQ(s) documents to see details of all updates.

Requirement 8 - Secure passwords/passphrases if passwords/passphrases are used, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all access into the CDE (cardholder data environment), and manage application and system accounts. Requirement 10 - Perform audit log reviews with automated mechanisms for specified events and system components and perform audit log reviews for all other system components at the frequency defined in a targeted risk analysis (TRA). Requirement 12 – Assign responsibility for information security, document any required targeted risk analyses, include phishing and social engineering in security awareness training, and designate specific personnel to be available on a 24/7 basis to respond to suspected or confirmed security breaches. SAQ B – Summary of new requirements: Requirement 3 – Policies and procedures for data retention and protection of stored account data if merchant has paper records that include account data (receipts, paper reports, etc.).

SAQ C – Summary of new requirements: Requirements 3 and 9 – Policies and procedures for data retention and protection of stored account data if merchant has paper records that include account data (receipts, paper reports, etc.). Requirement 5 – Malware protections for performing periodic evaluations at frequencies defined in targeted risk analyses (TRAs), for removable media, and to

may not be a cost-effective e-commerce payment route due to the associated level of security responsibly. The API method is generally used by larger organizations with specific processing needs, or organizations that wish to retain cardholder data. The applicable controls to secure all systems, people, and processes within an organization for PCI DSS compliance should not be underestimated. Merchants are advised not to store, process, or transmit cardholder within their own systems unless the nature of their payment acceptance is not compatible with any of the other models described previously. 2.6 Wholly Outsourced E-commerce Solutions Many e-commerce solutions exist that provide most or the entire merchant’s online shopping functionality and experience. These solutions provide more than just transaction processing capability, often including customer-facing features such as product search, cart capability, checkout, and account management; and back-office features such as product management, customer relationship management, order management, and appearance customizations. A hosted shopping cart is an e-commerce system that is hosted entirely on the service provider’s technological infrastructure. The e-commerce is not seamlessly integrated into the merchant’s website and the consumer is often directed off-site to select product and complete checkout. The use of such a solution can alleviate many but not all of the merchant’s PCI DSS responsibilities. All merchants have a responsibility to implement policies and procedures that govern safe handling of cardholder data even if they never expect to encounter credit cards. Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the merchant to vet the service provider and monitor its compliance to PCI DSS. See SAQ A for more information on assessing compliance for merchants who use these solutions. Note: Some merchants may reduce the number of applicable requirements by leveraging tokenization to eliminate payment card data storage. See Section 2.11.3, “Tokenization” for more information.

For example, the acquirer or payment brands determine whether the merchant:  May be required to complete an onsite assessment documented via a PCI DSS Report on Compliance (ROC) or  Is eligible to complete a self-assessment documented via one of the PCI DSS Self-Assessment Questionnaires (SAQs). Merchants eligible to self-assess their PCI DSS compliance should work with their acquirers or payment brands to determine which SAQ type is appropriate, based on the e-commerce implementation method used. The table below summarizes the relevant PCI DSS documentation for merchants that may be required to submit a ROC, as well as for those that may be eligible to self-assess via an SAQ. The corresponding number of PCI DSS requirements is included for each reporting method.

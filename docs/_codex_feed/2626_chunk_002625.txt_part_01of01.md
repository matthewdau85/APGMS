other consumer information only when necessary. Any cardholder data not deemed critical to business functions should be removed from the environment in accordance with the organization’s data-retention policies. This helps reduce the complexity and costs associated with protecting this data. In addition, organizations should evaluate business and operating procedures for alternatives to retaining cardholder data. 3.2 Develop Program, Policy, and Procedures A compliance program is a formalized set of policies, processes, and procedures with assigned accountability within an organization intended to ensure the organization's sustainable compliance with applicable and necessary standards and requirements. A formal compliance program allows an organization to monitor the health of its security controls, be proactive in the event that a control fails, and effectively communicate activities and compliance status throughout the organization. When designing a compliance program, it is important to understand the differences between these terms and concepts: ▪ A program typically includes strategic objectives, roles and responsibilities, and a plan to achieve business objectives. For example, a vendor-management program defines the roles and strategy to properly procure, on-board, manage, and off-board third-party service providers. ▪ A policy typically includes a statement of management intent or rules that must be followed⎯e.g., a password policy defining strong passwords and the frequency with which they must be changed. ▪ A process/procedure typically outlines the step-by-step tasks that responsible personnel must follow to properly complete tasks that align with the program and supporting policies⎯e.g., listing the steps needed to encrypt sensitive information before e-mailing it to a service provider. 5 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report (Verizon, yearly). Information Supplement • Best Practices for Maintaining PCI DSS Compliance • January 2019 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 10 To facilitate ongoing and sustainable compliance with PCI DSS, implementation of a compliance program should be supported with policies and defined procedures. Once completed and approved, policies and procedures should be disseminated to all appropriate individuals and business partners to ensure consistent understanding of strategic objectives and implemented processes. 3.3 Develop Performance Metrics to Measure Success Organizations should have the capability to quantify their ability to sustain security practices and PCI DSS compliance by developing a set of metrics that summarize the performance of the implemented security controls and compliance program. Risk reduction is a key metric for illustrating overall security-program effectiveness (see 3.5.3, “Using Risk to Balance Business Priorities with Security Needs”)—but metrics can provide meaningful indicators of security status at other levels within the program as well. Metrics may be used by compliance managers to prove the effectiveness of security initiatives, allocate resources appropriately, and demonstrate the efficiency and return on security investment to stakeholders. Metrics can be calculated from a combination of security-status monitoring, security- control assessment data, and data collected from one or more security controls or technologies. The collection of metrics alone does not directly result in the ability to maintain PCI DSS compliance. However, when these metrics are analyzed properly, they may provide mechanisms for determining whether sufficient controls are in place and whether they are operating effectively. 3.3.1 Types of Security Metrics There are a range of frameworks and options for selecting metrics, however, it is essential that they adequately serve their intended purpose. The maturity of an organization’s information security program largely determines which types of metrics can be gathered. For example, NIST has proposed three types of security metrics: implementation measures, efficiency and effectiveness measures, and impact measures.6 3.3.1.1 Implementation Measures Implementation measures are used to demonstrate progress in information security programs, specific security controls, and associated policies and procedures. Implementation metrics are usually described in percentages and may include such examples as: ▪ Percentage of information systems with password policies configured in accordance with policy (PCI DSS Requirements 8.1 and 8.2) ▪ Percentage of web servers configured in accordance with system configuration standards (PCI DSS Requirements 2.2, 2.3 and 10.4) 6 Elizabeth Chew, Marianne Swanson, Kevin Stine, Nadya Bartol, Anthony Brown, and Will Robinson, NIST Performance Measurement Guide for Information Security; SP 800-55 (revision 1) (NIST, 2008). Information Supplement • Best Practices for Maintaining PCI DSS Compliance • January 2019 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 11 ▪ Percentage of organizational personnel that have received security training (PCI DSS Requirements 6.5, 9.9.3, 12.6, and 12.10.4) ▪ Percentage of system-level changes documented and approved by management (PCI DSS Requirement 6.4.5) Upon initial implementation of a particular control, implementation measures will likely be less than 100%. As security controls mature and results begin to approach 100%, the compliance manager may conclude that systems have fully implemented the security controls addressed by this metric. At that point, any change to the measure (i.e., less than 100%) can be used as a trigger to indicate a failure in security controls. 3.3.1.2 Efficiency and Effectiveness Measures Efficiency and effectiveness measures are used to determine whether systematic program- level and individual security controls are designed and implemented correctly, operating as intended, and meeting the desired outcome. Control efficiency is a qualitative evaluation of a control environment or individual control to fully address the risk, including control complexity, segregation of duties, and the knowledge and competency of the personnel operating the control. Operating effectiveness, by contrast, evaluates and measures whether the control is

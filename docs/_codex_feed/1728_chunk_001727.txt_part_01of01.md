The industry standard for these arrangements is bilaterally agreed alternate electronic communications.555 Periodic Testing Tier 1 Framework Participants must establish, and periodically test, contingency arrangements to ensure that File Settlement Instructions and, if necessary, File Recall Instructions can be manually submitted during any loss of connectivity to the RITS Low Value Settlement Service. The industry standard for testing such contingency arrangements is set out in the LVSS BCP Arrangements which may be accessed via a link on the Company’s extranet.556 552 Deleted effective 23/9/02, version 004 r&p 007.02 554 Inserted effective 23/9/02, version 004 r&p 007.02 555 Last amended effective 4/3/08, version 037 r&p 002.08 556 Inserted effective 21/5/12, version 047 r&p 001.12 BULK ELECTRONIC CLEARING SYSTEM (CS2) PROCEDURES PART 10: CONTINGENCY PROCEDURES Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 103 10.10 Bilateral Testing of Contingency Exchange Arrangements557 A Tier 1 Framework Participant must bilaterally test its contingency exchange arrangements, which may be alternate electronic communications or a secondary method of contingency exchange arrangements, with a minimum of one other Tier 1 Framework Participants at least once each calendar half year and in accordance with the Contingency Exchange Testing Schedule. Compliance with the Contingency Exchange Testing Schedule can also be satisfied if a Tier 1 Framework Participant has used its contingency exchange arrangements with the relevant scheduled Tier 1 counterparty whilst managing a Disabling Event or other production issue in the 12 months before the final date of the scheduled testing period. In those circumstances, the use of the contingency exchange arrangements must still meet the testing requirements set out in this clause 10.10, including the use of live data and manual entry of File Settlement Instructions. 558 The Contingency Exchange Testing Schedule specifies the Tier 1 Framework Participants with which to conduct testing on a rotating regular basis to ensure that the contingency exchange arrangements with all Tier 1 Framework Participants are tested over a period of time that is no more than four calendar years apart. The Contingency Exchange Testing Schedule will be revised in the event of the admission or resignation of a Tier 1 Framework Participant or a change in the capacity in which a Tier 1 Framework Participant participates in the Bulk Electronic Clearing System Framework (CS2).559 A Tier 1 Framework Participant must send live data (DE transaction data and the associated DE summary file) using the contingency exchange arrangement and the data received must be used to process actual live transactions. Transmitting duplicate data during the test using primary exchange arrangements is not permitted. 560 To test members’ ability to use the RITS facility that provides for the manual entry of File Settlement Instructions, each Tier 1 Framework Participant must manually input some or all of the File Settlement Instructions corresponding to the Files exchanged in bilateral testing of contingency exchange arrangements.561 In addition, Tier 1 Framework Participants using physical medium for contingency exchange arrangements must complete a successful test of each bilateral arrangement at least once each calendar half year until replaced with alternate

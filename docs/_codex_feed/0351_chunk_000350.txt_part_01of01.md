Something you have –e.g. a card, token or device Something you know –e.g. a PIN, password or pattern Something you are –e.g. biometrics –a fingerprint, voice print or facial recognitionRisk Based Analysis and SCA are commonly used in an integrated approach, however the Framework only has obligations mandating the use of SCA, not Risk Based Analysis.Some low risk transaction types, including recurring payments, trusted customers and wallet transactions, are exempt from authentication. OBLIGATIONSThe Framework will be enforced through AusPayNet’s Issuers and Acquirers Community Code Set. It will work by defining fraudulent transaction value and volume thresholds that all Merchants and Issuers must remain below. Breaches of these thresholds will trigger obligations for Merchants or Issuers to take action. Repeated breaches over a period of time could ultimately result in financial penalties for Issuers or Merchants’ Acquirers.The initial Merchant Fraud Threshold is set to 20bps and $50,000 in fraud losses, per quarter The Merchant Fraud Rate is calculated using the value of fraudulent, settled, online CNP transactions, each quarter. To trigger a breach of the threshold, in addition to exceeding the 20bps Fraud Threshold, a Merchant must also have more than $50,000 in fraud losses for the reporting quarterThe initial Issuer Fraud Threshold is set to 15bps The Issuer Fraud Rate is calculated using the value of fraudulent, settled, online CNP transactions that were sent to an Issuer for authentication, each quarter.

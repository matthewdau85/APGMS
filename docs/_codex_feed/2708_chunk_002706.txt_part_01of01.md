designed to categorize and locate specific types of data, their use in environments where account data is present needs to be carefully controlled and monitored. Information Supplement • Protecting Telephone-Based Payment Card Data • November 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 44 7.2.6 Call Recording The example provided in Section 6.5.1 (Diagram 9, Pause- and-resume) only considers an implementation of call recording WITHIN the entity. Diagram 11 below represents a number of entities that outsource call recording using the same Level 1 Service Provider. Note: Storing SAD after authorization is not allowedrefer to Appendix D, “Call Recording Decision-making Process.” Diagram 11: Outsourced call recording The data from the entities may be merged at the level of the service provider and the cloud storage provider. Beyond the service-provider-specific PCI DSS requirements, the assessor assessing the entities and the entities themselves may verify that the provider complies with the requirements in PCI DSS Appendix A1, “Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Shared Hosting Providers.” Assessors assessing the service provider should consider whether the service provider or the cloud- storage provider should comply with the requirements in PCI DSS Appendix A1, “Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Shared Hosting Providers,” by considering how they are servicing the entities, and protecting each entities data, where shared services are at play. Information Supplement • Protecting Telephone-Based Payment Card Data • November 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 45 7.2.6.1 Selecting a call-recording service PCI DSS Requirement 12 states that the entity must maintain and implement policies and procedures to manage service providers with whom cardholder data is shared, or that could affect the security of cardholder data. This includes a written agreement by service providers acknowledging that they are responsible for the security of cardholder data they possess or otherwise store, process, or transmit on behalf of the customer. If the entity chooses to suppress or mask the payment card data before it is recorded, these requirements may not apply and a non-PCI DSS recording service may suffice. However, if payment card data is not suppressed or masked, or if it is possible that payment card data may be accidentally recorded, the entity should choose a PCI DSS compliant call-recording solution including the protection and secure deletion of the data in line with the entity’s data-retention policy.

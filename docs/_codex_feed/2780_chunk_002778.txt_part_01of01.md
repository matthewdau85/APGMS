A.6.6 Remedies In the event of a breach of Section A.6.2 by the Receiving Party, the Receiving Party acknowledges that the Disclosing Party will likely suffer irreparable damage that cannot be fully remedied by monetary damages. Therefore, in addition to any remedy that the Disclosing Party may possess pursuant to applicable law, the Disclosing Party retains the right to seek and obtain injunctive relief against any such breach in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event any such breach results in a claim by any third party, the Receiving Party shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Disclosing Party from any claims, damages, interest, attorney's fees, penalties, costs and expenses arising out of such third- party claim(s).

Page 46 related costs) that arise or result from any claim by any third party with respect to SSF Assessor’s (i) breach of its agreements, representations or warranties contained in this Agreement; (ii) participation in the SSF or use of any PCI Materials or SSF-related information (a) in violation of this Agreement or (b) in violation of any applicable law, rule, or regulation; (iii) non-performance of Services for any SSF Assessor Company client that has engaged SSF Assessor to perform Services, including without limitation claims asserted by SSF Assessor Company clients or Members; (iv) negligence or willful misconduct in connection with the SSF, this Agreement, or SSF Assessor’s performance of Services, except to the extent arising out of negligence or willful misconduct of an Indemnified Party; or (v) breach, violation, infringement, or misappropriation of any third-party Intellectual Property Right. All indemnities provided for under this Agreement shall be paid by SSF Assessor as incurred by the Indemnified Party. This indemnification shall be binding upon SSF Assessor and its executors, heirs, successors, and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to impose any indemnification obligation on SSF Assessor to the extent the corresponding claim or liability arises solely from a defect in the PCI Materials provided by an Indemnified Party and such PCI Materials are used by SSF Assessor without modification and in accordance with all then applicable publicly available updates, guidance, and best practices provided by PCI SSC. A.7.2 Indemnification Procedure SSF Assessor’s indemnity obligations are contingent on the Indemnified Party's providing notice of the claim or liability to SSF Assessor, provided that the failure to provide any such notice shall not relieve SSF Assessor of such indemnity obligations except and to the extent such failure has materially and adversely affected SSF Assessor’s ability to defend against such claim or liability. Upon receipt of such notice, SSF Assessor will be entitled to control, and will assume full responsibility for, the defense of such matter. PCI SSC will cooperate in all reasonable respects with SSF Assessor, at SSF Assessor’s expense, in the investigation, trial and defense of such claim or liability and any appeal arising there from; provided, however, that PCI SSC and/or its Members may, at their own cost and expense, participate in such investigation, trial and defense, and any appeal arising therefrom or assume the defense of any Indemnified Party. In any event, PCI SSC and/or its Members will each have the right to approve counsel engaged by SSF Assessor to represent any Indemnified Party affiliated therewith, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. SSF Assessor will not enter into any settlement of a claim that imposes any obligation or liability on PCI SSC or any other Indemnified Party without the express prior written consent of PCI SSC or such Indemnified Party, as applicable.

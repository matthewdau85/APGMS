genetic predisposition to that disability); or (k) is imputed to a person. To avoid doubt, a disability that is otherwise covered by this definition includes behaviour that is a symptom or manifestation of the disability. According to the Australian Network on Disability, “disability is any condition that restricts a person’s mental, sensory or mobility functions. It may be caused by accident, trauma, genetics or disease. A disability may be temporary or permanent, total or partial, lifelong or acquired, visible or invisible”. What creates barriers for people with disability? An alternate perspective on viewing the way people with disability interact with the world, is through the social model of disability. Moving away from a focus on medical definitions, the social model views disability “as the result of the interaction between people living with impairments and an environment filled with physical, attitudinal, communication and social barriers”. As a practical example to illustrate this, when someone using a wheelchair wants to enter a building and there are only stairs, it’s not their inability to walk that prevents them from entering the building - it’s the physical barrier caused by not having an alternative method of entry, such as a ramp, that creates a disability in the sense that the entry is inaccessible. The social model of disability carries the implication that the physical, attitudinal, communication and social environment must adapt so that people living with impairments can participate in society on an equal, barrier-free basis with others. Key disability statistics Over 4 million people in Australia have some form of disability. 1.8 million or 50.7% of Australians aged 65 and over have a disability, compared to 1 in 8 (12.5 %) aged under 65. That’s 1 in 5 people. Vision Australia estimates there are currently 357,000 people in Australia who are blind or have low vision. They project that the number of Australians who are blind or have low vision will grow to 564,000 by 2030. The likelihood of living with disability increases with age. 2 in 5 people with disability are 65 years or older. 35.9% of Australia’s 8.9 million households include a person with disability. 639,000 people with disability use mobility aids (14.9% of those with disability). Disability discrimination accounts for the highest volume of complaints made to the Australian Human Rights Commission. ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ ➜ Guidelines for Accessibility in PIN Entry on Touchscreen Terminals 22 4. SUPPORTING MATERIAL AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION What is discrimination? The definition of disability discrimination as outlined in the Disability Discrimination Act: “When a person with a disability is treated less favourably than a person without the disability in the same or similar circumstances.” For example, it would be ‘direct disability discrimination’ if a nightclub or restaurant refused a person entry because they are blind and have a guide dog. There is also indirect discrimination, “when there is a rule or policy that is the same for everyone but has an unfair effect on people with a particular disability.” For those involved in creating the infrastructure for making payments, it’s important to understand the interaction between disability barriers, and work to avoid discrimination by enhancing accessibility through inclusive design for people who may experience and access the world in different ways. ➜ People with disability as customers The disability community is much broader than the 4 million plus Australians who live with a wide range of visible and invisible impairments. It also includes their family, carers, friends, co-workers and the community organisations who support them. Under the Australian Government’s National Disability Insurance Scheme, which provides care and support to people with disability, more people are able to access social and recreational activities such as going to the movies or visiting a local coffee shop. Designing for inclusion is critical in ensuring that people with vision and / or motor impairments have equal access to making payments. The principles of inclusion and accessibility don’t just impact those living with disability – they lead to better outcomes for all users. Independent and equitable access to financial services and making payments in retail environments is highly important to the community that was surveyed by AusPayNet. Survey respondents ranked the following as being of high significance: • Not relying on other people to make or complete the payment, so they retain control of their financial decisions. • Having their security protected when making a payment and not having to disclose personal information to strangers. • Meeting their contractual obligation with their bank regarding not sharing their card PIN at any time. • Having the same level of equality as people who don’t have disability in making payments. • Not being personally impacted by lack of accessibility e.g. maintaining their self-worth, dignity, pride and independence.

SUPPORTING MATERIAL AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION ➜ The growing prevalence of touchscreens The first touchscreen was believed to be developed in the 1960s and the technology continued evolving rapidly as screens became more receptive to touch and gestures. Today, this market is continuing to grow and offers opportunities for innovation as the touchscreens increase in quality and decrease in cost. To this end, touchscreen

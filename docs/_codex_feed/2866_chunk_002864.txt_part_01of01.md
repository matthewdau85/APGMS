Environment.” The CDE is comprised of: The system components, people, and processes that store, process, or transmit cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data, and, System components that may not store, process, or transmit CHD/SAD but have unrestricted connectivity to system components that store, process, or transmit CHD/SAD. CERT Acronym for “Computer Emergency Response Team.” Change Control Processes and procedures to review, test, and approve changes to systems and software for impact before implementation. CIS Acronym for “Center for Internet Security.” Cleartext Data Column-Level Database Encryption Technique or technology (either software or hardware) for encrypting contents of a specific column in a database versus the full contents of the entire database. Alternatively, see Disk Encryption and File-Level Encryption. Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Description of products that are stock items not specifically customized or designed for a specific customer or user and are readily available for use. Compensating Controls See PCI DSS Appendices B and C. Compromise Also referred to as “data compromise” or “data breach.” Intrusion into a computer system where unauthorized disclosure/theft, modification, or destruction of cardholder data is suspected. Console Directly connected screen and/or keyboard which permits access and control of a server, mainframe computer, or other system type. See Non-Console Access. Consumer Individual cardholder purchasing goods, services, or both. Critical systems A system or technology that is deemed by the entity to be of particular importance. For example, a critical system may be essential for the performance of a business operation or for a security function to be maintained. Examples of critical systems often include security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data. Cryptographic Algorithm Also referred to as “encryption algorithm.” A clearly specified reversible mathematical process used for transforming cleartext data to encrypted data, and vice versa. See Strong Cryptography. Cryptographic Key A parameter used in conjunction with a cryptographic algorithm that is used for operations such as: Transforming cleartext data into ciphertext data, Transforming ciphertext data into cleartext data, A digital signature computed from data, Verifying a digital signature computed from data, An authentication code computed from data, or An exchange agreement of a shared secret. See Strong Cryptography. Cryptographic Key Generation Key generation is one of the functions within key management. The following documents provide recognized guidance on proper key generation: NIST Special Publication 800-133: Recommendation for Cryptographic Key Generation ISO 11568-2 Financial services — Key management (retail) — Part 2: Symmetric ciphers, their key management and life cycle ISO 11568-4 Financial services — Key management (retail) — Part 4: Asymmetric cryptosystems — Key management and life cycle 6.2 Key life cycle stages — Generation European Payments Council EPC 342-08 Guidelines on Algorithms Usage and Key Management 6.1.1 Key generation [for symmetric algorithms] 6.2.1 Key generation [for asymmetric algorithms] Cryptographic Key Management The set of processes and mechanisms which support cryptographic key establishment and maintenance, including replacing older keys with new keys as necessary. Cryptoperiod The time span during which a cryptographic key can be used for its defined purpose. Often defined in terms of the period for which the key is active and/or the amount of ciphertext that has been produced by the key, and according to industry best practices and guidelines (for example, NIST Special Publication 800-57 ). Customized Approach See PCI DSS section: 8 Approaches for Implementing and Validating PCI DSS. CVSS Acronym for “Common Vulnerability Scoring System.” Refer to ASV Program Guide for more information. d Data-Flow Diagram A diagram showing how and where data flows through an entity’s applications, systems, networks, and to/from external parties. Default Account Login account predefined in a system, application, or device to permit initial access when system is first put into service. Additional default accounts may also be generated by the system as part of the installation process. Default Password Password on system administration, user, or service accounts predefined in a system, application, or device; usually associated with default account. Default accounts and passwords are published and well known, and therefore easily guessed. Defined Approach See PCI DSS section: 8 Approaches for Implementing and Validating PCI DSS. Disk Encryption Technique or technology (either software or hardware) for encrypting all stored data on a device (for example, a hard disk or flash drive). Alternatively, File-Level Encryption or Column-Level Database Encryption is used to encrypt contents of specific files or columns. DMZ Abbreviation for “demilitarized zone.” Physical or logical sub-network that provides an additional layer of security to an organization’s internal private network. DNS Acronym for “Domain Name System.” DORA Acronym for “Digital Operational Resilience Act.” Dual Control Process of using two or more separate entities (usually persons) operating in concert to protect sensitive functions or information. Both entities are equally responsible for the physical protection of materials involved in vulnerable transactions. No single person is permitted to access or use the materials (for example, the cryptographic key). For manual key generation, conveyance, loading, storage, and retrieval, dual control requires dividing knowledge of the key among the entities. See Split Knowledge. e E-commerce (web) Redirection Server A server that redirects a customer browser from a merchant’s website to a different location for payment processing during an ecommerce transaction. ECC Acronym for “Elliptic Curve Cryptography.” See Strong Cryptography . Encryption The (reversible) transformation of data by a cryptographic algorithm to produce cipher text, i.e., to hide the information content of the data. See Strong Cryptography . Encryption Algorithm See Cryptographic Algorithm . Entity

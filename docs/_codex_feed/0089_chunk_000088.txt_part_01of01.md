CEO’s corner What to expect in 2025 2025 is an election year, with the election needing to be held on or before 17 May 2025. This may have an impact on the progress of payments-related legislation, such as the implementation of the Scams Prevention Framework (which passed the Senate on 12 February 2025 and the House of Representatives the following day), the changes to the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act (PSRA) , and the Exposure Draft for the first tranche of payments licensing legislation. It may also impact the timing of the next iteration of the Strategic Plan for Payments. Outside of the policy domain, and as part of our strategic role in ensuring the effective modernisation and rationalisation of Australia’s payment systems, AusPayNet is leading the coordination of industry transformation programs on cheques, BECS and AES, subject to regulatory approvals. Cheques In June 2023, the Australian Government released its Strategic Plan for Australia's Payments System , which outlined the key priorities and supporting initiatives for Australia’s payments system. One of the key priorities was modernising payments infrastructure, including by phasing out cheques. In November 2024, following a consultation process, the Government released its Cheques Transition Plan , which outlined next steps to ensure that the transition away from cheques is smooth and Australians who use cheques are well supported through the transition. The Transition Plan is to be delivered in two phases: By 30 June 2028, cease issuance of cheques On 30 September 2029, cease acceptance of cheques, and close the cheques system. In the Cheques Transition Plan , the Government noted AusPayNet’s leadership of an industry program of work to coordinate the transition away from cheques, subject to seeking and receiving ACCC authorisation to enable collaboration among industry participants and other key stakeholders on the coordination program. AusPayNet’s program of work to coordinate the transition will include workstreams on overall migration management, migration of use cases, and clear and consistent industry communications. On 18 December 2024, AusPayNet was granted interim authorisation by the ACCC on the Cheques Transition Program. Final Determination by the ACCC is expected in April 2025. If granted, it would enable collaboration among industry participants and other key stakeholders on the coordination program. The Interim Authorisation enables AusPayNet to start the preparatory work needed for a coordinated wind-down of the cheques system. AusPayNet has accordingly established a program of work to achieve this outcome, and updates will be regularly provided to APCS Members and key stakeholders.

BECS Government’s Strategic Plan also expressed support for an industry-led transition away from the legacy BECS Framework, in favour of more modern account-to-account payments alternatives. In November 2023, after an extensive three-year consultation with the payments industry and key stakeholders, AusPayNet announced June 2030 as the conditional target end-date for the BECS Framework. The aim of the conditional target end-date was to enable greater focus on and acceleration of the transition to more modern alternatives that better meet the new and emerging needs of the end-users and the Australian payments ecosystem. The conditional target end-date is subject to the industry making progress in a number of areas, including but not limited to: account reachability use case capabilities (particularly for bulk payments made by businesses and government) access to and resilience of modern alternatives cost of change and ongoing cost of modern alternatives an industry level scope, timeline and roadmap for the transition. As the custodians of the BECS Framework, AusPayNet is committed to ensuring the transition will be managed responsibly, with no disruption to the efficient and secure flow of essential payments. AusPayNet has established a program of work to achieve this outcome, with activities across three dimensions: collaborate with industry, coordinate the migration, and control the future of the framework. For more information, you can access our BECS Transition Program website page . AES Another priority in Government’s Strategic Plan is promoting a safe and resilient payments system that protects end-users and safeguards their ability to transact safely and securely. This includes ensuring the payments industry is well-placed to protect against cyber-attacks and requiring the industry to continually uplift system-wide security standards and practices, including encryption methods for card payments systems. The Plan called for the cards payment industry to begin migration to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in 2025. This process requires the design, development, and delivery of an industry-wide program to migrate the Australian card payments system from Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES) to AES cryptography standards. The scope of this program includes: 55 issuers 25 acquirers domestic and international card schemes 970,000 payment terminals 25,200 ATMs. Neither physical cards nor digital wallets are impacted directly by this change. AusPayNet is leading an industry-wide program to migrate the Australian card payments system to the AES. Australia is a leading jurisdiction in the global migration to the AES. The program is planned for completion in 2030/31, subject to any necessary regulatory approvals. For more information, you can access our AES Migration Program website page . Payments reforms AusPayNet continues to engage with regulators and Government stakeholders on the broad range of regulatory reforms affecting the payments industry, including the following consultations. RBA Review of Merchant Card Payment Costs and Surcharging In November, AusPayNet responded to the Issues Paper for the RBA's Review of Merchant Card Payment Costs and Surcharging – the first phase of the RBA's planned

All Rights Reserved. Page 1 A QSA Company is a data security firm certified by the PCI SSC to perform on-site assessments of a company’s PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance to ensure that robust policies and procedures are in place to protect cardholder data. The QSA Program plays a critical role in the adoption of PCI Security Standards. The PCI SSC has introduced a new Associate QSA Program for 2018, with the goal of attracting new cyber talent to the QSA Program and easing the resource constraints felt by QSA Companies. The Associate QSA certification will provide a professional path for new entrants to join the payment card industry and gain experience to qualify as a QSA. This project is part of a broader initiative to evolve the QSA Program to ensure its sustainability and quality in a changing payment environment. Additional changes to the QSA Program will focus on supporting future standards and technologies and attracting new cyber talent to develop the next generation of QSAs. Q 1 Why did the PCI SSC create the Associate QSA Program? A An overall shortage of cyber security talent is making it difficult for QSA Companies to find suitable new assessors. As a result, assessors are increasingly expensive to hire and retain, driving assessment costs up for merchants that rely on their services. The Associate QSA certification program is designed to bring new cyber talent to the QSA Program, easing the resource constraints for QSA Companies, and ensuring high quality QSA services are available for merchants and service providers into the future. Q 2 How is the Associate QSA certification different than the QSA certification? A The Associate QSA certification is designed for employees of QSA Companies that do not yet have enough experience to be a QSA but who are interested in achieving QSA certification in the future. It provides a professional path to gain the necessary experience to become a QSA. Q 3 What is an Associate QSA eligible to do? A Associate QSAs can assist in conducting PCI DSS assessments with the oversight of a QSA Mentor at their QSA Company. They are not qualified to confirm PCI DSS compliance or sign off on Attestations of Compliance (AOC) or Reports on Compliance (ROC). This is further detailed in the QSA Qualification Requirements and Program Guide. Q 4 What are the pre-requisites to become an Associate QSA? A Associate QSAs must be employed by an eligible QSA Company. Pre-requisites also include a college or university degree in an IT or security-related field or two years’ experience in IT or security.

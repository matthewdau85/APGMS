force, red means it is no longer in force and orange means that it is in force but has unincorporated commenced amendments. You can see from the effective date of the current version, when a new version is due to commence. A new compilation will usually be registered within a month of the amendments commencing .

On the text view page, you will see the words Latest Version in orange, along with an orange icon that provides more details.

This entry includes the amending title(s) and the effective date for the amendments. To access more information, click the link in the entry to navigate to the amending title. What is a Replacement vs a Rectification? There are two types of document replacement on the Register: Rectification and Replacement . A rectification is made when the text of a document is incorrect. This includes cases where an amendment has been incorrectly incorporated or where a conversion error has caused images or symbols to display incorrectly. Rectifications have previously been known as corrections. A replacement occurs when there is an error in presentation or incorrect supporting information. Examples include updating or correcting endnotes, fixing a table of contents, correcting headers or page numbers, splitting documents into volumes, removing blank pages, updating commencement dates, correcting text wrapping issues, or fixing an error in a gazette notice. The information in the footer of a rectified or replaced document will tell you that the document is a rectification or replacement and the date of the rectification or replacement. For example the words in the footer might be Replaced Authorised Version registered (date of replacement) (Register ID) . The original document footer before replacement would have the words Authorised Version registered (date of replacement) (Register ID) . Details of the rectification or replacement are found at the bottom of the downloads page and are accessed by clicking the icon next to the replacement date. What does effective mean? For a compilation, the effective date refers to either the date from which the amended version of the law applies or, if it is a superseded version, the period during which that first version was in effect. For an As made version of an Act or instrument the effective date is the date that the Act received royal assent or the instrument was registered. The effective date is not the commencement date for an Act or instrument. The commencement details for an Act or instrument are usually set out in the text of that Act or instrument. How do I use the What's New function? The What's New function displays new and amended titles recently published on the Federal Register of Legislation within the last 7 days. Recently published titles are grouped by the relevant collection: Acts, legislative instruments, notifiable instruments, gazettes, administrative arrangements orders and prerogative instruments. Clicking on a What's New Collection link will launch a search for all titles within that collection registered within the relevant period and take you to a search results page. The results on this page are sorted by registration date, with the most recently published items appearing at the top of the list. As with any set of searched results, you can use the filters above the list to further refine your results. To view recently published As made versions, use the Type filter on the search results page and select As Made from the options and then click Search to see the relevant hits. To view recently published compilations, use the Type filter on the search results page and select Compilation from the options and then click Search to see the relevant hits. Where no items were published within a collection during the last 7 days, clicking on the link will inform you that "Your search returned no results." If you are looking for titles across collections, we recommend using the Advanced search , leaving the Search for field blank and changing the Date option from Effective Latest to Registered > On or Between and entering either a specific date or a date range of interest. These results can then be further sorted and filtered, including between As made versions

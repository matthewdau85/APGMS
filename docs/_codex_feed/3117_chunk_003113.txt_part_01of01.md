Case Study PCI Awareness Training Real Experience. Real Benefits. No one tells our story better than our training participants themselves. Here’s what Norma had to say... How does this training benefit you and your company? The instructor-led training provided a background in PCI and gave me a better understanding of the various requirements. This helps me daily – in writing policies, standards, and guidelines to make our company’s network more secure. What was the highlight of your training experience? The personal instruction and lively classroom dynamic with the ability to learn from others’ questions. The instructor was knowledgeable and shared interesting stories from his professional experience that would be pertinent for me – and the class – on our PCI journey. Through this classroom experience, I gained insights as to what the 12 requirements mean and how best to apply them to my situation. What aspects of the training are you most likely to use in your job? I was happy to be able to apply the knowledge gained in my training immediately. As part of completing our SAQ-D, I am involved in coordinating a network re-design plan to segregate sensitive data per the applicable PCI DSS requirements. So I would say the section on requirement 1 and network segmentation was most useful for me. Did you learn anything that surprised you? I was amazed to learn the simple things a company can do to prevent a breach – covering the top three reasons a breach occurs was an eye-opener. Would you recommend this training to others? Absolutely yes! I appreciated getting PCI training directly from the experts that actually created the standards – and learning from instructors who have been QSAs and have tons of in-depth experience to share.

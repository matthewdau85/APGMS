CASE STUDY Internal Security Assessor (ISA) Training Real Experience. Real Beneﬁ ts. No one tells our story better than our training participants themselves. Here’s what Tippy had to say... Why did you choose to get training through the Council? As the industry experts, I felt that getting ISA training directly from the Council was the obvious, best option for both the company and me. Additionally, Rational Group is a Participating Organization of the PCI SSC, and the advance insights POs receive on guidance and clariﬁ cation on the Standards along with availability of focused training classes were certainly an added beneﬁ t. How does this training beneﬁ t you – and your company? Our customers care deeply about the security of their transactions with our brands, and as a dynamic, fast-paced company our aim is always to remain as up to date as possible on security requirements and security- related technologies which beneﬁ t both our brands and our customers. The knowledge gained in the course speciﬁ cally helps me in preparing to complete the Report on Compliance (RoC) for the Pokerstars brand, as well as preparing our Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) for some of the other brands. Plus our acquirers/payment processors recognize the beneﬁ ts of the in-house ISA qualiﬁ cation – it reduces potential risk for both the merchant and the acquirer. How are you using what you learned in this course, in your job? With credit cards accounting for almost 60% of our payments through our online poker games and tournaments, we always want to ensure our customers (players) and our business is well protected. I use the knowledge from the training daily. In fact, my ISA training prompted us to proactively look at our data security policies and procedures and map them to incorporate the current PCI Standards, as appropriate – and to integrate them into our “Business As Usual” (BAU) daily activities and upcoming business projects. THE COMPANY Rational Group Douglas Bay Complex, King Edward Road Onchan, Isle of Man IM3 1DZ The Rational Group is a leader in online gaming and also produces live poker events around the world. Rational Group’s businesses (Pokerstars, Full Tilt, European Poker Tour, Pokerstars Caribbean Adventure, Latin American Poker Tour, and Asia-Paciﬁ c Poker Tour) are among the most respected in the industry for delivering high-quality player experiences, unrivalled customer service, and innovative software. Holding more online poker licenses than any other e-gaming company, Rational Group employs industry-leading practices in payment security, game integrity, and player fund protection. THE PRACTITIONER Tippy Ahluwalia Information Security Auditor 3 years in current position A former QSA with more than 14 years of information security, technical support and compliance auditing experience, Tippy has focused most recently on regulatory security and compliance auditing for Rational Group. THE OUTCOME The training covering network conﬁ guration and monitoring requirements provided a direct advantage in assisting to implement new SIEM, IPS, HIDS/FIM monitoring and alerting systems appropriately. How would you compare your QSA experience with your ISA experience? My previous external QSA work focused on conducting assessments for merchants in various industries and at various levels – and required a lot of travel to various sites. The change from QSA to ISA allows me to focus my eﬀ orts squarely on Rational Group, where I can apply my QSA assessment experience and make a positive impact on the organization’s PCI compliance eﬀ orts. In my current role as an internal ISA, I’m working on preparation (gap analysis) for Pokerstars’ upcoming annual PCI DSS assessment and RoC submission. I am also working on Full Tilt Poker’s annual PCI compliance initiatives which involve SAQ-D completion, veriﬁ cation and submission. Did anything surprise you about the ISA training? I found some of my classmate’s (merchant) scenarios surprising during the open discussions. An example included a merchant who felt CHD scanning was not necessarily applicable to their merchant level. I was surprised by this, as CHD scanning is vitally important to prove that there is no unintentional storage of legacy PANs and to ensure the PCI scope is correctly identiﬁ ed. The instructor reinforced the importance of CHD scanning and it was great to see that there was a uniﬁ ed agreement within the class as well. Do you feel the training was worthwhile? Yes. I enjoyed attending the ISA training class. I found the instructor to be fun, interesting and knowledgeable. I would strongly recommend this training because by incorporating concepts from the class, we have strengthened our compliance posture, saved on external audit hours, and my ISA qualiﬁ cation is viewed very positively by our acquirers.

or online, may include name, email address, company name, and company type. This information is used to comply with our contractual obligations to the event or initiative organizers or operators and other parties in connection with those events and initiatives, including to operate such events and facilitate your participation, and may be used and shared with our contractors or other event participants for such purpose and as described under “Restricted Web Sites and Portals” above. Additionally, at the time you provide us with such information, we will where appropriate request your consent to our storing, processing, distributing, and use of such data for the purposes for which it is being provided. In connection with such events, we may also request additional information such as address, company affiliate, number of company employees, and other company information, which may be used for marketing purposes, and may be distributed to event sponsors. Consent to such use of such additional information is requested at the time the information is collected. All information collected in connection with such events is retained in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Privacy Policy. 7. Company Information Company information is information that is associated with the name and address of our participant, member and other stakeholder or user organizations and may include data about usage and service operation. The primary representative of any such organization may request limited usage reports to gauge the extent of their employees’ involvement in our activities. You should be aware that information regarding your participation in technical committees, working groups, and online discussions and events, for example, may be made available to your company’s primary representative and to PCI SSC staff members. 8. How We Use Your Information We may use non-personal data that is aggregated for reporting about the Web site activity, usability, performance, effectiveness, or participation. It may be used to improve the experience, usability, and content of the Web site or future activities. We may use personal information to offer or provide services that support our activities or those of our participants, members, stakeholders or other users, and their collaboration with us, or to provide you with electronic newsletters, announcements, surveys or other information. When accessing restricted PCI SSC Web pages, portals or activities, your personal user information may be used or tracked in order to support collaboration, ensure authorized access, and enable communication among participants or members. 9. Information Sharing We do not sell, rent, or lease any individual’s personal information or lists of email addresses to any third parties for marketing purposes, and we take commercially reasonable steps to maintain the security of this information. We will not do any of the foregoing in the future without providing you with notice and an opportunity to opt-out or opt-in, as required by law. Similarly, we do not offer financial incentives associated with our collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information. However, we reserve the right to supply any such information to any organization into which PCI SSC may merge in the future or to which it may make any transfer in order to enable a third party to continue part or all of our mission or activities. We also reserve the right to release personal information to protect our systems or business, if we reasonably believe you to be in violation of applicable terms of use, or if we reasonably believe you to have initiated or participated in any illegal activity. In addition, please be aware that in certain circumstances, we may be obligated to release your personal information pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or other orders. In keeping with our open process, we may maintain publicly accessible archives for the vast majority of our activities. For example, posting an email message to any PCI SSC-hosted mail list or discussion forum, providing request for comment feedback, or registering for one of our public or other meetings may result in your personal information becoming part of corresponding publicly accessible archives. If you are a PCI Security Standards Council participant or member, you should be aware that some items of your personal information may be visible to other such participants and members, and to the public. Our participant and member databases may retain information about your name, email address, company affiliation and such other personal address, identifying data, and any previously-supplied such data, as you choose to supply. That data may be generally visible to other such participants or members, and to the public. Your name, email address, and other information you may supply also may be included in publicly accessible records of our various committees, working groups, online events and discussions, and similar activities that you join, in various places, including: (i) the permanently-posted attendance and other records of those activities; (ii) documents generated by the activity, which may be permanently archived; and, (iii) along with message content, in the permanent archives of our email lists, which also may be public. Please remember that any information (including personal information) that you disclose in public areas of the Web site or in connection with public or broad participation activities, such as forums (in person or online), message boards, news groups, and other activities, may become publicly or broadly available information that others may collect, circulate, and use. Because we cannot and do not control the acts of others, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose information about yourself

automated asset-management technologies. Features to look for in an asset-management tool include:  Automated device scanning  Device categorization  Installed OS and software detection  License tracking  Update or patch status  Installation date  Location At a minimum, a detailed spreadsheet could be used, although the maintenance of a manual list will likely be impractical. There are many commercial and open-source asset management software tools that could be considered. If distinct groups within an organization manage different populations of systems or asset management tools, a standardized format for the inventory and schedule for publishing updates should be established across the entire organization. PCI DSS offers guidance about selecting each type or combination and function to ensure that the assessor is confident that the sample represents the whole. The best way to achieve this with the fewest number of samples is through automation and standardization, where systems have similar or identical configurations for as many characteristics as possible. This can either reduce the number of sampled items or potentially reduce the amount of review effort per sample. The assessor can rely on the standardized operating system Information Supplement • PCI DSS for Large Organizations • February 2020 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

Organizations with highly standardized builds and the tools to demonstrate this may not need to produce sample data for hundreds of systems. Conversely, organizations with different technologies, legacy systems, manual processes, or systems that support legacy components may have to produce sample data for a large number of systems. 9.2 System Hardening Defining and maintaining secure default configurations for a diverse set of hardware, operating systems, and software can also pose a challenge. For system hardening organizations need to determine:  Whether there is current documentation and implementation guidance for each configuration?  How is it confirmed that systems match the appropriate configuration standard?  For systems that cannot adhere to hardening standards how are these justified, documented, and managed? To address these questions, understanding the various configurations used by the organization and having a centralized configuration management policy (or policies) are crucial. Identifying the various system configurations maintained by the organization is tightly connected with the asset-management process. Large organizations must determine what assets they have in order to define how to configure those systems securely. While an inventory of system configurations could be constructed manually, to be most effective, an automated tool or set of tools should be used to collect this information. After the unique combination of assets and systems has been identified, define a policy or set of policies for how these systems should be configured securely. Ideally, these policies or hardening standards should be based on hardening best practices for the various assets or components that make up a specific type of system. Simply adopting a configuration standard (such as the CIS framework) for each system component is not appropriate. Each hardened configuration standard should be customized to address the unique security needs of that particular system type, the combination of components that make up that system, and the system’s overall function and risk profile. After the system hardening standards are defined, existing systems should be monitored to ensure they remain configured in a manner consistent with the hardening standards. Again, it is possible (albeit likely arduous) to monitor configurations manually. For this reason, it is recommended that automated solutions be used to maintain an updated inventory in as close to real-time as possible and provide alerts about any systems that fall out of compliance with the hardening standards. If automation is not implemented, manual reviews must be performed and documentation for each system maintained. Whenever changes to systems occur, follow up reviews will be necessary. If systems fall out of compliance, they will need to be brought back into compliance with hardening standards, or justification will have to be defined and documented to explain why systems deviate from defined hardening standards. 9.3 Access Control Maintaining effective access control practices across a diverse set of individuals, roles, and systems is another aspect of PCI DSS compliance that can be difficult for large, complex organizations to adopt due to the frequency of changes. Ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the resources requires robust communication channels within and between business units. Due to the volume of individuals, systems, sites, and privileges that large or complex organizations have to manage, using a centralized access control system is highly recommended. However, substantial thought and planning should go into designing and maintaining the architecture, processes, and components of the access-control system. One way to simplify the architecture of a centralized access control system is to separate the access-control system for the CDE from the rest of the company network (for example, into its own “domain”).

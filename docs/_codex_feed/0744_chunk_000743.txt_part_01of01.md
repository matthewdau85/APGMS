The first value in the array must be an identifier for the Scheme, from the following list: “VISA”, “Mastercard”, “AMEX”, “UPI”, “eftpos” The specific JSON Schema for the provision of the data points described above is provided in Annexure A: JSON Schema. Where the data format field above indicates “String”, the supported character set shall be ISO/IEC 8859-1.3 3 ISO/IEC 8859-1:1998, Information technology—8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets—Part 1: Latin alphabet No. 1, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings which includes the standard English alphabet, extended characters from Latin languages (such as ç, é, and ñ) and common symbols.

(b) Deprecated algorithms and techniques in the OpenPGP standard must not be used. (c) SHA-16, and any features which use SHA-1, should not be used, even if allowed under RFC 9580. 3.2.2 The Sending Party and Receiving Party must either verify Public Keys used for encryption before use, or ensure that these have been received through a trusted communications mechanism. 3.3 Requirement #3: Data Transfer Mechanism – Data Medium 3.3.1 The Sending Party must Port the MPR Data using a plain text file encoded in the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON7) format which follows the JSON Schema provided in Annexure A. 3.4 Requirement #4: Data Transfer Mechanism – Data Delivery 3.4.1 The Sending Party must transfer the MPR Data via Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)8. 3.5 Requirement #5: Third Party Authorisation and Access 3.5.1 The Primary Parties are accountable for the generation, sending and receipt of the MPR Data to be Ported. 3.5.2 Where the Primary Party is reliant on a third party to complete the generation and/or Porting of the MPR Data, the Primary Party that has the direct relationship with the third party is responsible for: (a) obtaining the information required to complete the generation of the MPR Data from the third party; and/or (b) authorising that third party to directly transfer the MPR Data held by the third party to the Receiving Party. 3.6 Requirement #6: Timeliness of Data Transfer 3.6.1 The Sending Party must Port the MPR Data in a timely manner. The Sending Party is responsible for ensuring that any relevant third parties supporting the Sending Party to Port the MPR Data also meet this requirement. 4 OpenPGP is a freely available standard used to encrypt and/or sign messages and documents. 5 IETF RFC 9580 is the name of the document containing details of the OpenPGP format and requirements. 6 Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) is a cryptographic hash function defined in NIST FIPS 180-4. 7 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is an open standard, lightweight data-interchange format that uses human-readable text. 8 SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is a Secure File Transfer Protocol.

(c) After collecting all relevant information from AE1 and AE2, AusPayNet will review the matter to determine whether any non-compliance has occurred. (d) Where AusPayNet determines that there has not been non-compliance with the Standard, AusPayNet will notify AE1 and AE2 and no further action will be taken. (e) Where AusPayNet determines that non-compliance with the Standard has occurred, AusPayNet may elect to do any or a combination of the following Rectification Steps: (i) assist AE2 to resolve the issue within a reasonable timeframe, taking into account the nature and severity of the non-compliance; (ii) facilitate resolution between AE1 and AE2; (iii) obtain from AE2 a written confirmation of intended actions to rectify the non-compliance; and/or (iv) obtain from AE2 a written confirmation of future compliance with Requirements of the Standard. 4.3 Consequences of Non-Compliance 4.3.1 Where an Applicable Entity fails to comply with any determined Rectification Steps, AusPayNet may use its discretion to remove the Applicable Entity from the Compliance List. 4.4 Annual Reporting Requirements 4.4.1 All Applicable Entities must complete and submit to AusPayNet by email to standardsdevelopment@auspaynet.com.au an Annual Compliance and Monitoring Survey, in the form set out in Annexure D: Annual Compliance and Monitoring Survey Response by 31 January each year.

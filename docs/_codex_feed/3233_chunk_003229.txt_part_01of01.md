PCI Security Standards Council Bulletin: Updated PCI 3DS Core Technical FAQs 29 September 2023 The PCI 3DS Core Technical FAQs for use with Version 1.0 document has been updated in the PCI SSC Document Library. This update is in response to stakeholder feedback and is provided through the technical FAQ process to expeditiously address this feedback. Technical FAQ Q3 has been revised to no longer exclusively require the evaluation of non-console HSM access solutions by an independent laboratory to verify compliance with ISO 13491, provided an alternative set of criteria is met. The update includes a set of alternative requirements, that if met in their entirety, can be used to satisfy the currently published requirements P2-6.2.1 through P2-6.2.5. The Technical FAQs are an integral part of PCI 3DS Core Security Requirements and shall be fully considered during the PCI 3DS Core Security Standard evaluation process. The updated Technical FAQ for PCI 3DS Core can be found in the Document Library. ###

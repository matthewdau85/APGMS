7. Real-time payments (NPP) Real-time payments in Australia occur over the New Payments Platform (NPP). The NPP is operated by NPP Australia (NPPA). As a platform for innovation, the NPP plays an increasingly important role in Australia’s digital economy. The main features of the NPP are: • Speed - payments are processed in real-time and funds are available immediately • Accessibility - payments are available 24/7, 365 days a year • Data-richness - payments messaging is based on the ISO20022 standard • Convenience - PayID, the platform’s addressing service, allows users to link accounts to a mobile number or email address, for simple addressing of payments. Governance of real-time payments NPP Australia owns, operates and governs the NPP. It sets the operational rules and compliance requirements for participating organisations and for processing payments on the platform. The RBA manages the RITS system and provides the Fast Settlement Service (FSS) which supports real-time settlement of NPP payments. Real-time payments operations The NPP has a distributed architecture model. Participating organisations, who choose to directly connect, host a payment gateway (PAG) containing automated rules for processing and routing transactions between other directly connected participants and the RBA. The NPP PAGs and infrastructure were custom built by SWIFT. The platform uses the data-rich ISO messaging standard ISO20022, which allows additional data to accompany payments. NPP payment messages support 280 characters of unstructured data. New Payments Platform 2 ------------ 2 This diagram is used with permission from the NPPA.

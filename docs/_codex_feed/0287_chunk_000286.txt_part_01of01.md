Further, AusPayNet does not operate the underlying infrastructure relied upon to make payments. We do not initiate, clear, settle, oversee or otherwise have involvement in payment transactions conducted by members. How does AusPayNet support APRA regulated members with their obligations under APRA’s CPS230? AusPayNet maintains systems and processes to facilitate members’ communication with each other during any major disruption to payments clearing or settlement system(s). It also enables members to react quickly to disruptions and mitigate adverse impact on payments clearing and settlement. Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC) Is AusPayNet regulated by the ACCC? AusPayNet is established to create confidence in payments including by setting enforceable industry standards for a safe, reliable and effective payments system; leading transformation in payments to drive efficiency, innovation and choice; and being the home for ecosystem collaboration and strategic insight. To achieve these corporate objectives and as the industry self-regulator, we manage the inherent risks which arise under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (CCA) through various measures including competition protocols to support our member’s communications and interactions with one another and seeking authorisation from the ACCC when considered appropriate.

of risk, depending upon various factors such as:  The magnitude and type of the TPSP services provided (e.g., single contractor, cloud provider, etc.)  The volume of exposure to a CHD or CDE compromise  The probability and frequency of threats to the organization or its assets  Whether the TPSP has ever been involved in a compromise of cardholder data The PCI DSS Risk Assessment Guidelines provide further information for conducting a risk assessment and can be referenced by entities looking for more detailed guidance in this process. Below is a high-level list of some of the questions and topics that may be appropriate to consider as part of the risk assessment. The list is not exhaustive and is meant as a starting point for an organization to use when creating its own risk-assessment process: Security Governance and Risk Management  Does the TPSP have an information security program in place that includes documented policies and procedures?  What types of internal or external audits, if any, are performed at the TPSP’s location(s)?  Are there other PCI or other industry standards that are applicable to the environment or TPSP?  Does the TPSP conduct periodic vulnerability scans and penetration tests on assets, applications, and systems containing customer data?  Does the TPSP formally reassess and re-evaluate its information security threats and risks at regular intervals, based on the frequency of emerging threats to its systems and processes? Is the assessment process based on a standardized risk-assessment methodology (referenced in PCI DSS Requirement 12.27)?  Has the TPSP ever had a data breach? 7 This reference is to PCI DSS v3.1 – April 2015 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 14 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 Human Resources Practices  How are background checks performed on resources that may have access to TPSP customer information? Are the background checks repeated at predetermined intervals?  How are terminations handled?  Are non-disclosure policies in place to protect both the TPSP and its customer information from disclosure?  Does the TPSP have policies concerning transmitting, storing, and processing of sensitive data, as well as customer data? Physical Security  Is there a physical security program in place at the TPSP locations where applicable systems or services are provided? Third-Party External Entities  Do any external entities engaged by the TPSP have access to the TPSP’s data processing facilities, systems, or applications?  Does the TPSP perform due diligence on external entities with which it engages?  Does the TPSP monitor the compliance and risk of external entities with which it engages? Configuration Management  Is there a formal change control and configuration management process in place at the TPSP?  Does the TPSP update critical patches within a specified timeframe? Does it have a policy concerning patch management?  Does the TPSP have any hardware or software that is no longer supported by the manufacturer (beyond its end-of-life)?  Are systems and applications hardened according to a documented standard?  Does the TPSP have secure configuration baselines for all of the platforms comprising its common service infrastructure? Access Authorization  How is logical and physical access to customer data and assets authorized?  If systems-access processes are shared, are the roles and responsibilities clearly documented?  How are rights for physical and logical access reviewed?  Does the TPSP always use a unique authentication credential (such as a password/phrase) for each customer? The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 15 Information Supplement • Third-Party Security Assurance • March 2016 Incident Response  Does the TPSP have an incident response plan?  Does the TPSP have procedures for reporting logical and physical security, and privacy incidents to customers?  Do the TPSP procedures include contact information for authorities or forensic investigators? Malware Controls  What controls does the TPSP have in place to detect, contain, and eradicate viruses, worms, spyware, and malicious code?  Are these controls implemented on all TPSP assets that transmit, store, or process the entity’s cardholder data?  What types of change-detection mechanisms are present on the TPSP’s systems?  Has the TPSP invested in any security products or services other than those required by PCI (anti- virus, FIM) that improve its ability to detect malware? Segregation and Security Controls  What controls are in place to keep customer systems, applications, and data segregated from other customer assets and inaccessible to other customers or the TPSP’s internal network? 3.4 Documenting Results An organization should also consider fully documenting the results of its research regarding the TPSP and review of the TPSP’s compliance status. In addition to any other information and materials deemed necessary or appropriate through the due diligence process, each entity should strongly consider capturing and including the following pieces of critical data, as each will be invaluable in the future:  Anniversary date – What is the date on which compliance documentation expires, requiring revalidation to have taken place?  Compliance validation vendors – With what security and compliance vendors and assessors does the TPSP work? This may include QSAs, ASVs performing scans, etc.  Acquiring bank – If applicable, with what acquiring bank does the TPSP work?

PCI Security Standards Council Bulletin: Card Production Errata, AOCs, ROCs, and FAQ Published 30 June 2022 The PCI SSC has published documents supporting the Card Production and Provisioning Security Requirements. With significant changes made to version 3.0 of the requirements, the documents will help payment card vendors understand and implement the Security Requirements and assist with performing and reporting results of their Card Production assessment. The following documents are now available in the PCI SSC Document Library: Card Production and Provisioning Security Requirements (Physical and Logical) v3.0.1 • Errata update to v3.0. Changes consist primarily of grammar and formatting, along with incorporation of FAQ text. Card Production and Provisioning Report on Compliance (ROCs) and Attestations of Compliance (AOCs) • AOCs and ROCs are validation tools intended to assist performing and reporting the results of Card Production assessments. In addition to updated ROCs and AOCs for Physical and Logical Security Requirements, there is a new ROC and AOC dedicated to use of a Security Operations Center (SOC). The new SOC ROC and AOC are based on an Appendix in the Physical Security Requirements. • From 1 October through 31 December, ROCs and AOCs for version v2.0 and v3.0.1 are supported. As of 1 January 2023, version 2 of the standards and validation documents will be retired. Card Production and Provisioning Technical FAQs • These technical FAQs provide answers to questions regarding both the PCI Card Production and Provisioning Logical Security Requirements and the PCI Card Production and Provisioning Physical Security Requirements. This is the initial release of v3 Technical FAQs and includes the addition of two new FAQs regarding Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) or PCI-approved Hardware Security Modules where their approvals have lapsed. While the Card Production and Provisioning Security Requirements are maintained by the PCI SSC, compliance is directly managed by the payment brands. Card vendors are encouraged to work with the individual payment brands to confirm timing for performance of security reviews against the PCI Card Production and Provisioning Security Requirements v3.0.1.

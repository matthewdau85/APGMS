cloud enables scalability, cost efficiency, and improved resilience, in particular helping Participants manage peak processing periods such as Christmas and Easter. AP+ is working closely with its vendor SWIFT and Participants to deliver a cloud-based solution for the relevant components of the NPP infrastructure, whilst ensuring the NPP remains robust and adaptable as transaction volumes grow. The target date for this capability to be ready for adoption by Participants is May 2026. 5. Connecting all relevant accounts to send and receive NPP payments Over 114 million accounts - about 87% of BECS-reachable accounts held by NPP participating organisations – can now receive NPP payments (as at 30 September 2024), an increase of 12% year on year 1 . NPP Participants have plans to enable another ~ 13 million accounts over the next 2-3 years and aim to connect nearly all the remaining BECS-reachable accounts before BECS is retired. Most currently unreachable accounts are low-transaction interest-bearing accounts like loans, term deposits, and grandfathered accounts. Participants have reported that in most cases where an account is not NPP-reachable, it is linked to a transaction account that is available - making it easy to transfer funds to the non-reachable account at a customer level. AP+ continues to work with industry on resolving outstanding account reach gaps, as well as individual financial institutions’ strategies to manage the customer experience. Approximately 30 BECS members are not currently participating in the NPP. Many are foreign bank subsidiaries focused on trade finance and institutional banking with low transaction volumes. AP+ is exploring a modified access model to facilitate their NPP connection in consultation with industry. NPP reachable accounts Source: Participant provided data. As at 30 September 2024. 6. Establishing a contingency framework for NPP The NPP is a secure, resilient, and highly available payment system that provides critical infrastructure for the Australian economy. It operates within an established Incident Management Framework, which includes response and recovery measures in the event of an incident. Currently, BECS serves as the de facto contingency for the NPP in case of an outage. However, with BECS set to be decommissioned, AP+ will work with industry during 2025 on a contingency strategy and framework to ensure the NPP can manage and recover from prolonged systemic outages, particularly as it takes on greater volumes. This strategy may involve a suite of solutions to cover different scenarios and use cases as well as enhanced incident reporting measures Since its launch in 2018, there has been no failure of central NPP infrastructure. From time to time however, individual organisations connected to the NPP do experience planned and unplanned outages to their services. In 2024, 50% of the Participant reported outage incidents were resolved within 2 hours and 75% were resolved in under 6 hours. NPP Participants must meet availability targets of no more than two minutes outage per month. Consequences for failure to meet these availability targets include non-compliance charges. AP+ continues to work closely with NPP Participants to drive improvements in resilience. Unlocking the potential of modern payments now For businesses and government, the transition to modern payments doesn’t have to wait. While there are some key milestones for AP+ and our industry partners as we approach 2030 and the winding-down of Australia’s legacy payments infrastructure, the benefits of faster, data-rich payments are available now – and it’s time for businesses to start planning for this transition. A phased approach can make the transition more manageable and is an approach being adopted by many businesses today. How businesses consider a phased approach will depend on where individual businesses see the greatest benefits. Businesses may start by focusing on outbound payments, then inbound payments with the adoption of PayTo. Alternatively, they may decide to start by offering PayTo for payments from new customers and then move onto migrating existing direct debit payments. Or, with the impending introduction of Payday super, businesses may choose to start by focusing on their super and payroll payments. Whichever approach businesses take, the capability to modernise payments is available now. The first step for businesses is to start the conversation with their bank or payment service provider/s. How can businesses benefit from the move to NPP? Working closely with industry and end users We’ll continue to work closely with industry, our members and end users and provide updates on key milestones and developments as this transformation progresses. Stay tuned for updates on how business are already experiencing the opportunities and benefits of modern payments.

AP+ and Participants provide reporting to the RBA on progress made to enable these accounts on a 6 monthly basis for Participants and annually for all Identified Institutions.

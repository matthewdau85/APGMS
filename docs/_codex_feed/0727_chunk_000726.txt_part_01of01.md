These include minimum security standards, interoperability standards and value added services that support how payment cards are used throughout Australia. These standards and requirements are contained within the IAC Code Set which is structured as follows: The Card Not Present Fraud Mitigation Framework (CNP Framework) was created in 2019 in consultation with relevant stakeholders in the payments industry. The CNP Framework sets out an approach to mitigating the impact of card-not-present payments fraud for merchants, consumers, Issuers, Acquirers, card schemes, payment gateways, payment system providers, and regulators. It is designed to reduce fraud in CNP online channels, while ensuring that online transactions continue to grow. Volume 7 implements the CNP Framework into the IAC Code Set. Volume 7 contains additional mandatory obligations for Issuers and Acquirers to those found in Volumes 2 and 3 of the IAC Code Set. 1.2 Application This Volume 7 applies to Australian acquired CNP Transactions conducted using Australian issued cards which are not Out of Scope Transactions. Volume 7 codifies and gives effect to the matters the subject of the CNP Framework and as such operates to the exclusion of, and take precedence over, the CNP Framework. Notes in this Volume 7 are included for guidance only and are not operative provisions of the IAC Code Set. 1.3 Out of Scope This Volume 7 does NOT apply to the following: 27BCNP Transactions conducted by MOTO and manual entry; and1 1 Last amended effective 29/8/22, version 014 r&p 001.22 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 7 – CARD NOT PRESENT CODE PART 1 PURPOSE, APPLICATION AND DEFINITIONS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 4 28BCNP Transactions in which the card used is a corporate card, gift card or Prepaid Card. 2 (i) A corporate card is a card issued to a company and at the company’s request to certain employees that enables the cardholder to undertake transactions and is intended to be used for commercial purposes, commonly travel and entertainment expenses. (ii) A gift card is a debit card that is loaded with an amount of money and may be used to purchase goods or services up to the value of the loaded amount. Note: The following, by definition and application of this Code in clause 1.2 are also Out of Scope Transactions:3 (a) transactions in which the cardholder is physically present, including POS payments and ATM withdrawals or transfers. (b) non-card remote commerce transactions; and (c) CNP transactions acquired outside of Australia, and cards issued outside of Australia. (d) Future iterations of this Volume may consider transaction types currently deemed out of scope. In the meantime, however, IAC Participants are strongly encouraged to take a “best effort” approach to apply SCA principles and mitigate fraud for transactions acquired outside of Australia. 1.4 Definitions Definitions are located in a separate document entitled ‘Interpretation & Definitions’.

PCI Security Standards Council Bulletin: New PCI DSS v4.x Worksheet and Guidelines Published to Support Security as a Continuous Process 28 June 2023 PCI SSC has published the PCI DSS v4.x Items Noted for Improvement (INFI) Instructions and Worksheet to support security as a continuous process. Developed with feedback from PCI SSC’s global payments community, this worksheet is designed to provide a consistent method to identify and document areas needing improvement in an organization's security posture, to help organizations address those areas and support their ability to maintain security as a continuous process. The INFI worksheet is intended for internal use between the assessor and assessed entity. Qualified Security Assessors (QSAs) are required to complete this worksheet for all PCI DSS v4.0 assessments documented in a Report on Compliance (ROC). While it is not required for Internal Security Assessors (ISAs) or self-assessments, it is recommended as it is a valuable tool to help organizations identify and address areas needing improvement and to ultimately improve their security posture. To support the effective use of this worksheet, PCI SSC has published additional supporting materials, including FAQs for the INFI worksheet and guidance on the use of INFI and compensating controls. The worksheet and supporting materials are linked below and can also be downloaded from the PCI SSC Document Library. • INFI Instructions and Worksheet • FAQs for INFI Worksheet • INFI and Compensating Controls Guidance Updates to the QSA Program Guide and QSA Qualification Requirements have also been published to the PCI SSC Document Library and include assessor expectations and requirements for the completion of the INFI Worksheet. ### The information in this bulletin is no longer valid as of 20 March 2024 and has been superseded by a new bulletin available here.

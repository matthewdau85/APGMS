On 1 May 2025, AusPayNet’s Board approved a Standard for Payment Service Provider Porting of Merchant Payment-Related Data (Standard) . The Standard has a 12-month transition period commencing 1 July 2025 to enable entities intending to adopt the Standard to become compliant. The Standard and accompanying guidelines have been developed to assist the payments industry in meeting the RBA’s Expectations for Tokenisation of Payments Cards and Storage of Primary Account Numbers (PANs) issued in May 2024, specifically Expectations 4.ii and 4.iii relating to portability. The Standard aims to reduce the friction associated with the porting of a merchant’s customer payment data. This friction can impede merchants from efficiently switching Payment Service Providers (PSPs), and therefore competition. This Standard reduces friction by detailing a common set of requirements for the secure transfer, to or from a PSP, of customer payment data associated with card on file payment information. The Standard was developed with the support of an industry working group and then issued for wider consultation to approximately 100 stakeholders. AusPayNet is grateful for the strong contribution and collaboration of all participants in this process. Contact If you have any questions, please contact AusPayNet‘s Head of Standards Development .

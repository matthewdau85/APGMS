should work with their acquirers or payment brands to determine which SAQ type is appropriate, based on the e-commerce implementation method used. The table below summarizes the relevant PCI DSS documentation for merchants that may be required to submit a ROC, as well as for those that may be eligible to self-assess via an SAQ. The corresponding number of PCI DSS requirements is included for each reporting method.

E-commerce is a card-not-present (CNP) payment channel and includes:  E-commerce websites accessible from any web browser, including “mobile-device friendly” versions accessible via the browser on smart phones, tablets, and other consumer mobile devices  “App” versions of the merchant’s e-commerce website, i.e., apps downloadable to the consumer’s mobile device that have online payment functionality (consumer mobile payments) The merchant may be involved in initiating or triggering the transaction; however, it is always the cardholder who enters the payment information (i.e., cardholder data) on a device that is not controlled or provided by the merchant. For example, the merchant may instigate the sales process (i.e., invoicing) by sending the cardholder an e-mail message with a unique payment URL for them to complete the credit card transaction via the Internet. Alternatively, for example, the merchant may retain payment card details initially submitted by the cardholder for an e-commerce payment in order to initiate ongoing recurring transactions, such as subscriptions. Depending on how the card details are stored and recurring transactions processed, these recurring payments may also be considered e-commerce. Some merchants have introduced e-commerce payments into what are traditionally card-present environments—for example, quick-service restaurants. While present on the merchant premises, the consumer initiates a card payment using their own mobile device via the “mobile-friendly” merchant website or app. 2.9.2 Non E-commerce Transactions Payment channels and methods that could be confused with but are not e-commerce include:  Merchant payment acceptance using a COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) mobile device: o With a card reader (connected to the mobile device via cable to the radio jack, or using Bluetooth):  Card data is captured through dip or swipe of the payment card. o Without a card reader, merchant-initiated:  Merchant manually enters the consumer’s payment card details into the mobile device’s web browser (e.g., via its online order management website or a third-party virtual terminal).  Merchant manually enters the consumer’s payment card details into an app on the mobile device, providing virtual terminal functionality.  Merchant-initiated payments using a web browser: o Merchant manually enters the consumer’s payment card details into web browser—e.g., via its online order management website or a third-party virtual terminal.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 23  Consumer-initiated payments using a web browser on the merchant’s payment kiosk on the merchant’s premises or merchant-provided payment device (such as tablets for payment at a restaurant table): o Consumer manually enters their payment card details into the web browser on the merchant’s payment kiosk or through the provided payment device. These non-e-commerce methods may be used/offered in card-present (CP) or card-not-present (CNP) scenarios. A merchant should implement appropriate PCI DSS controls to ensure the security of the devices and facilities offered to the public, in addition to securing its e-commerce website (or app). 2.10 E-commerce Scoping Considerations When a merchant is scoping its cardholder data environment and determining where PCI DSS controls need to be applied, it must ensure the online capture and retention of cardholder data is considered as well as the method used to process and authorize the payment. Typically, for CNP e-commerce transactions, payment card authorization is real-time as the e-commerce site has connectivity to a payment gateway or payment service provider. However, the merchant’s site may only capture the consumer’s payment card data with no subsequent authorization—for example, if card details

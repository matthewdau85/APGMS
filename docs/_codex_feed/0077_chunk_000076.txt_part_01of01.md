CEO’s Corner Year in Review: FY24 The end of FY24 seems an appropriate time to review our performance against our strategic goals. Transformation In leading the transformation of Australian payments to drive efficiency, innovation and choice: On cheques, we have worked with Members and Government on a simplified, improved proposal for the orderly wind down of cheques with coordination of activities and communications to minimise disruption for end users. We will be engaging with the ACCC to ensure compliance with competition laws and we expect more on this to be publicly announced by the Government soon. On BECS, we announced the target end-date of June 2030 for the BECS Framework and have started gathering information and insights on industry readiness for the migration away from BECS. In so doing, we recognise that a successful decommissioning of BECS may benefit from industry coordination, designed in a way that ensures compliance with competition laws. AusPayNet is assessing the benefits and potential timing of coordination and will have more to share on this by the end of 2024. The COIN migration continues to make good progress: 71 per cent of the transition to the new COIN is now complete, with the remainder planned for completion in mid-September. Progress on ISO 20022 migration also continues, with Members scheduled to fully migrate to the new message format by the end of 2024, a year ahead of the global deadline. The program has also demonstrated global leadership on ISO 20022 harmonisation, which is scheduled for HVCS and cross-border payments by the end of 2025, two years ahead of the global target. AusPayNet is also assisting AP+ with harmonisation. On AES, work on the technical blueprint and migration approach is progressing, with the migration to begin next calendar year (subject to ACCC approval). We are proud to say that Australia is now seen as a leading jurisdiction in this upgrade of the card payments system to mitigate threats from quantum computing. Standards On 22 December 2023, the RBA issued final Expectations for the Tokenisation of Payments Cards and Storage of Primary Account Numbers, aimed at improving security, efficiency and competition for online card payments. The RBA’s Payments System Board requested that AusPayNet coordinate the industry’s response to meeting these Expectations, including leading the drafting of any new standards that may be required. AusPayNet is using this request as a test case for the development of technical standards, prior to any authorisation as an Authorised Standards Setting Body (ASSB) and continuing to set and enforce industry standards for a safe, reliable and effective payments system. Insights In terms of AusPayNet delivering strategic insights to its Members and key stakeholders: The policy space remained incredibly active. We continue to have strong relationships with Government (Commonwealth and State), RBA and relevant regulators, and made submissions to a myriad of consultations, leveraging input from Members, including the second round of payments licensing consultation, industry scam codes, and the future of the cheques system. In the events space, we delivered our 2023 Annual Summit, our largest and most successful to date, and introduced both a member webinar series and a Melbourne Member event. I personally spoke at Pay360 (UK), the BIS Innovation Summit (Switzerland), the Payments Canada Summit, PIPC (South Africa) and Global Fintech Fest (India). Our revamped Emerging Technology Experts Group published an industry point-of-view (POV) on sustainability in payments and has produced an industry POV on AI in payments, which will be released in the second half of the calendar year. Update on payments reforms AusPayNet continues to engage with regulators and Government stakeholders on the broad range of payments reforms currently underway, including the following consultations. Response to the consultation on modernising Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) regime In June, AusPayNet responded to the Attorney-General’s Department’s second consultation on modernising Australia’s AML/CTF regime . The AML/CTF regime is a critical part of Australia’s efforts to prevent criminals from receiving the proceeds of their illegal activity and to stop funds from falling into the hands of terrorist organisations. In line with AusPayNet’s commitment to working with Members, Government and other stakeholders to defend the payments system from economic crime, our submission welcomed the review of the AML/CTF regime to ensure that it remains clear, fit-for-purpose and meets international standards and best practice. In line with our submission to the first consultation in June 2023, we expressed particular support for: Simplifying and modernising the AML/CTF regime, including by adopting a risk-based approach that would enable more effective identification and mitigation of ML/TF risks relevant to each business Clarifying the scope of services subject to AML/CTF regulation and considering greater alignment in definitions between the AML/CTF regime and Treasury’s proposed payment service provider (PSP) licensing framework Adopting further changes to the tipping-off provisions to better enable collaboration across the ecosystem to help facilitate the detection and disruption of economic crime Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory reporting frameworks, including by ensuring that regulators and law enforcement have the tools and resources required to effectively analyse and act on the intelligence acquired Futureproofing the regime by only including the overarching, principles-based obligations in the AML/CTF Act, supported by clear and comprehensive Rules and Guidance that help businesses better understand how to meet these obligations Ensuring that reporting entities are given sufficient time for effective implementation of any changes, given the significant technological and procedural uplift that is likely to be required.

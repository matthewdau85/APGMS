Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 1 1 Introduction Cloud computing is a form of distributed computing1 that enables access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable resources with on-demand provisioning and administration. There are a number of factors to be considered when planning to use cloud services, and organizations need to clearly understand their needs before they can determine whether and how they will be met by a particular solution or provider. This guidance is intended for organizations using, or thinking of using, providing or assessing cloud technologies. It provides guidance on the use of cloud technologies and considerations for maintaining security controls in cloud environments. This document is intended to provide an initial point of discussion for Providers and Customers and is not intended to address specific technical configurations or compliant scenarios. The guidance in this document is structured as follows: ▪ Cloud Overview – Describes the cloud deployment models and service models discussed throughout this document. ▪ Cloud Provider/Customer Relationships – Discusses how roles and responsibilities may differ across different cloud service and cloud deployment models. ▪ PCI DSS Considerations – Provides guidance and examples to help determine responsibilities for individual PCI DSS requirements, and includes segmentation and scoping considerations. ▪ PCI DSS Compliance Challenges – Describes some of the challenges associated with validating PCI DSS compliance in a cloud environment. ▪ Security Considerations – Explores a number of business and technical security considerations for the use of cloud technologies. The following appendices are included to provide additional guidance: ▪ Appendix A: PCI DSS Responsibilities for Different Service Models – Presents additional considerations to help determine PCI DSS responsibilities across different cloud service models. ▪ Appendix B: Sample Inventory – Presents a sample system inventory for cloud computing environments. ▪ Appendix C: PCI DSS Responsibility Management Matrix – Presents a sample matrix for documenting how PCI DSS responsibilities are assigned between Provider and Customer. ▪ Appendix D: PCI DSS Implementation Considerations – Suggests a starting set of questions that may help in determining how PCI DSS requirements can be met in a particular cloud environment. ▪ Appendix E: Technical Security Considerations – Provides guidance on various cloud-based technologies. 1 Wayne Jansen and Timothy Grance, NIST Guidelines on Security and Privacy in Public Cloud Computing, NIST Special Publication 800-144, (Gaithersburg: National Institute of Standards and Technology, December 2011). https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-144. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 2 The information in this document provides supplemental guidance and does not supersede, replace or extend the requirements in any PCI SSC standard, nor does it endorse the use of any specific technologies, products or services. For the purposes of this document, all references made to PCI DSS are to version 3.2; however, the general principles and practices offered here may be applied beyond the context of PCI DSS. 1.1 Intended Audience The information in this document is intended for merchants, service providers, assessors and other entities looking for guidance on how the use of cloud computing may affect PCI DSS compliance. For example: ▪ Merchants – Guidance on the security and PCI DSS considerations that are applicable to cloud environments and may be useful to merchants managing their own cloud infrastructure as well as those looking to engage with a third party. Guidance for working with third-party Providers and PCI DSS compliance challenges may also be useful. ▪ Service Providers – Guidance on the security and PCI DSS considerations that may provide useful information for Providers to assist their understanding of the PCI DSS requirements, and may also help Providers to better understand Customers’ PCI DSS needs. The guidance on Provider/Customer relationships and PCI DSS compliance challenges herein may also be useful for Providers. ▪ Assessors – Guidance on the security and PCI DSS considerations that may help assessors to understand what they need to know about an environment in order to be able to determine whether a PCI DSS requirement has been met. 1.2 Terminology In addition to terms defined in the PCI DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations and Acronyms, the following terms are used throughout this document: ▪ Cloud Service Provider ("Provider"): It is the entity providing the cloud service. It acquires and manages the infrastructure required for providing the services, runs the cloud software that provides the services and delivers the cloud services through network access.2 ▪ Cloud Service Customer ("Customer"): The entity subscribing to a service provided by a Provider. May include merchants, service providers, payment processors and other entities utilizing cloud services. ▪ Cloud Service User: Person, or entity acting on his or her behalf, associated with a Customer that uses cloud services. Note: Examples of such entities include devices and applications.3 ▪ Multi-tenancy: Allocation of physical or virtual resources such that multiple cloud tenants and their computations and data are isolated from and inaccessible to one another.4 ▪ Cloud Tenant: One or more Customers sharing access to a set of physical and virtual resources. 2 Fang Liu, Jin Tong, Jian Mao, Robert Bohn,

Additionally these readers must be EMVCo. Level 1 type approved (see G.7.3). The provision of contactless ICC support is optional but where provided the reader must be capable of reading Cards compliant to ISO/IEC 10536-1, ISO/IEC 14443- 1 or ISO/IEC 15693-1, as appropriate. Additionally these readers must be EMVCo. Level 1 type approved (see G.7.3). EMV compliance All ICC readers (EMV – IFD) must be type approved (Level 1) by EMVCo prior to deployment. All contactless readers (EMV – proximity coupling device or PCD) must be type approved (Level 1) by EMVCo prior to deployment. All Kernels must be EMVCo Level 2 type approved prior to deployment. For details of these approval requirements see http://www.emvco.com/faq.aspx?id=40. All Kernels providing contactless reader support must conform to the requirements of EMVCo. – EMV Contactless Specification for Payment Systems – Book C 1,2,3 & 4 and be Card scheme approved. In addition, it must be ensured that all contactless kernels in an ATM must ensure the following Level 2 functions are provided for the acceptance of contactless Cards: (a) Device type unattended, online only, Operation control by financial institution; (b) Online only; (c) Only allowed Cardholder Verification Method (CVM) is online PIN; (d) Transactions supported are cash withdrawal, inquiry. Transfer, payment, cash deposit, and purchases are optional; (e) No support for offline data authentication (SDA, DDA, CDA); and (f) Device will decline Transaction in the case where online is not available. IAC CODE SET VOLUME 6 – ATM SYSTEM CODE ANNEXURE G. EMV@ATM TERMINAL STANDARDS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 114 CVM support The only Cardholder Verification Method (CVM) to be supported is online encrypted PIN. All devices must decline all Transactions if online is not available. The only acceptable algorithm for PIN encipherment is DEA 3 (TDES) as specified in AS 2805 part 5.4. Transaction sequencing Optionally, at the end of a Transaction sequence the Cardholder may be prompted for another Transaction. In the case of ICC Cards the action to be taken will vary according to whether the Card has a single application or multiple applications (see clauses G.8.1 to G.8.4). To support Transaction chaining, an encrypted PIN may be retained and reused in the subsequent Transaction if one is requested by the Cardholder. This encrypted PIN must be deleted at the end of the Cardholder session. Chained Transactions are not permitted subsequent to Card withdrawal. G.8 Preferred transaction flows The preferred transaction flows reference “not on-us” Card processing requirements only and vary in accordance with the Card type – domestic or International, single or multi-application. Each of the possible permutations is illustrated in the following figures. Although these are the preferred flows, these rules place no restriction on Acquirers implementing other flows or sequences. Single app International card The preferred Transaction flow when an international ICC Card is presented to a chip enabled ATM where such results in only a single entry in the candidate list is illustrated in Figure G.8.1. In this case application selection is to proceed without Cardholder interaction, Account selection should follow individual scheme requirements and where further transactions are requested to flow should return to the "Select Transaction Type" step. Allowable Transactions types are limited to Cash Withdrawal and Balance Inquiry. Where account selection has not been offered the account type code 1 (DE.3-2) is to be set to 0x00 or Default.

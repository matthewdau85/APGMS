to be raised. Mutual accreditation with New Zealand Through the Trans-Tasman single economic market agenda, the Australian and New Zealand governments announced a common approach to eInvoicing. With this common approach, the Australia and New Zealand Peppol Authorities have an aligned accreditation process that supports mutual accreditation of Peppol service providers between the two countries. Once you are accredited in Australia, you can request mutual accreditation with New Zealand by directly contacting the New Zealand Peppol Authority at support@nzpeppol.govt.nz . Accreditation annual review There will be an annual review of the accreditation status to ensure Peppol service providers continue to meet their obligations on an on-going basis. An annual review will include: due diligence checks completed by the Australian Peppol Authority provision of a current enforceable Professional Indemnity Insurance policy of at least A$1 million (or equivalent in other currency) per occurrence adherence to A-NZ eInvoicing security requirements, which includes completion of section A of the A-NZ eInvoicing Security Questionnaire reviewing your evidence to ensure it aligns to the current security requirements and is up to date, and submitting updated evidence where required advising if there have been changes to your business or product environment.

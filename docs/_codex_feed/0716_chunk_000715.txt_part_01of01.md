selected in the first transaction for additional transactions in the same session. 98 To avoid PIN verification failures, session key changes for PIN encryption keys should not occur during any chained sequence. Further chained Transactions are not permitted subsequent to Card removal. Note that this is in contravention of PCI-DSS requirements which do not allow a PIN to be stored even if encrypted subsequent to authorisation and that PCI requirements for ATMs are currently under review such that changes may be required in the future. If the encrypted PIN has been cleared, multiple application Cards should return to the: 99 (a) Application selection step, if the Terminal offers application selection to Cardholders; or 100 (b) Account selection step, if the Terminal auto-selects the highest priority application. 101 The prompt for "Further transactions" must also provide for a short duration timeout to ensure that the PIN is erased even if the Cardholder walks away from the ATM at that prompt. PIN retention To support chained Transactions, an encrypted PIN may be retained and reused in the subsequent Transaction if requested by the Cardholder. The encrypted PIN must be deleted at the end of the Cardholder session. G.5 Technical Fallback Where the chip data cannot be read due to a chip failure or IFD fault, the Transaction may continue using data read from the magnetic stripe only where no Cardholder action is required to transition from chip read to magnetic stripe read. Technical Fallback is not permitted subsequent to successful application selection. 97 Deleted effective 21/11/17, version 006 r&p 002.17 98 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 99 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 100 Inserted effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 101 Inserted effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 6 – ATM SYSTEM CODE ANNEXURE G. EMV@ATM TERMINAL STANDARDS Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 108 Such Transactions are denoted to the Card Issuer by presence of FCR code in DE47. See clause C.3 of the IAC Code Set Volume 6 (Technology Fallback) for details. As this feature may be removed at a future time, Acquirers and deployers should endeavour to ensure this feature can be readily disabled should that be required in the future. Fallback102 There is only one type of fallback at ATM, it occurs when a chip Card, presented at a chip Terminal, cannot be read due to a technical issue with the chip read which results in the technology “falling back” to a magnetic stripe transaction. Valid reasons for a fallback transaction include; 1. a defective or scratched chip 2. a chip reader that is defective 3. a chip intentionally damaged so it cannot be read, on a counterfeit card encoded with magnetic data stolen from a chip card. 4. a card without a chip, encoded with magnetic data stolen from a chip card. 5. An ATM Terminal’s inability to recognise a particular application (AIDs that should be supported if that scheme is accepted by an Acquirer) is not a valid reason for a fallback transaction. 102 Inserted effective 21/11/17, version 006 r&p 002.17 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 6 – ATM SYSTEM CODE ANNEXURE G.

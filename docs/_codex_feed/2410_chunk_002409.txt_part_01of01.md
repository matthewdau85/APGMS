A title ID is the ID given to the Principal or first version of a title. These numbers have an A (Acts), L (Legislative Instruments), N (Notifiable Instruments), Q (Prerogative instruments, Constitution, Administrative Arrangement Orders and Norfolk Island legislation) or G (Gazettes) following the year in the ID number. For example, the Title ID for the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 is C1901 A 00002. A compilation ID is the ID of a particular subsequent version of a title. These numbers have a C following the year in the ID number. These numbers substitute the A for a C, following the year in the ID number. For example, Compilation No 36 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 is C2019 C 00028 and Compilation No 37 of that Act is C2023 C 00213. How do I search for legislation by Register ID?

Searching for a title ID will take you to the text page of the latest version of the title. Searching for a compilation ID will take you to a particular version of a title. Where can I get further information on how to use search, browse and advanced search? For information on browse, search and advanced search see https://www.legislation.gov.au/help-and-resources/using-the-legislation-register/how-to-use-browse-search-and-advanced-search . Where can I find the explanatory statement for a legislative instrument? An explanatory statement or ES is a document that sets out how a legislative instrument is expected to operate and provides details on its individual provisions . An explanatory statement is registered along with a legislative instrument and is therefore associated with the As made version of a legislative instrument. The explanatory statement for new legislative instruments can be viewed by changing the View document dropdown from Legislative instrument to Explanatory statement . You can also access Word and PDF copies of a legislative instrument's explanatory statement by navigating to the Download tab . If there are no options to view or download an explanatory statement for the legislative instrument you are interested in, you may be looking at a later version of that instrument. To see the explanatory statement you will need to navigate to the As made version of that instrument. There are two ways you can do this: Go to All versions and select the As made version of the instrument; or Edit the url and change the date range to asmade . For example, by updating https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2014L00870/ 2024-01-23 /text to https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2014L00870/ asmade /text. Where can I find all Bills and Explanatory Memoranda (EM) for a particular year? The best place to find a list of all Bills and Explanatory Memoranda (EM) for a particular year is the Australian Parliament House (APH) website. The authoritative source for Bills, EMs and associated documents, including information about their passage through Parliament, is the Parliament of Australia Bills page at https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation . For historic pre-1997 Bills and EMs not available on this page you can search APH Parlinfo database at https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/ . Explanatory Memoranda to accompany every government Bill introduced into the Parliament have been produced since 1983 and they are usually available on both the APH Bills page and the APH Parlinfo database. For the earlier years of 1901 to 1982 there is an online Index to Explanatory Memoranda that was produced by the Parliamentary Library that will tell you if an EM or similar document was produced for a Bill. The Federal Register of Legislation no longer publishes copies of all the Bills and EMs for each year. For Acts from 1997 onwards the Register provides a link to the APH website Bills page at the bottom of the All versions page under the heading Originating Bill and Explanatory Memorandum . Links to Bills before they become an Act and Bills that are not passed by Parliament are not available through the Federal Register of Legislation, but you can search for them on the APH Parlinfo database at https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/ .

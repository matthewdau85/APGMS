in any PCI SSC Standard. 55 7 Best Practices In addition to meeting the PCI DSS requirements applicable to a specific merchant e-commerce implementation, e-commerce merchants should consider implementing the additional PCI DSS requirements and some or all of the security best practices noted in this section. 7.1 Know the Location of all Your Cardholder Data Data-flow diagrams provide an important aid to understanding the scope of the cardholder data environment by showing the actual flow of cardholder data as it is being transmitted across various networks and systems (PCI DSS Requirement 1.1.3). Periodic review will ensure accuracy as changes to the environment may occur. Data-discovery software may help a merchant find any unencrypted PANs in the environment. A well-designed data flow diagram will:  Identify each system involved in the storing, processing and transmission of cardholder data (CHD).  Identify any system connected to the systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data.  Illustrate how cardholder data is processed, such as how CHD is managed within a web application’s functionality, and page along with how data flows within a network or across multiple networks.  Illustrate where security controls are implemented.  Illustrate and make a clear distinction between payments processed under the merchant’s responsibility (whether developed internally or purchased from a third party and integrated with a shopping cart) and payments processed solely within third-party environments. 7.2 If You Don’t Need It, Don’t Store It Eliminate any cardholder data that is not needed per PCI DSS Requirement 3.1. Consolidate necessary cardholder data in known and manageable locations and isolate all cardholder data away from non- cardholder environments. These steps may reduce the number of locations and amount of cardholder data that require protection, as well as the number of access points to the CDE that need to be secured. As a reminder, sensitive authentication data (SAD) cannot be stored after authorization, even if encrypted. 7.3 Evaluate Risks Associated with the Selected E-commerce Technology Merchants should evaluate thoroughly and carefully the risks associated with each e-commerce solution prior to selecting or implementing one. Whether an e-commerce solution is fully hosted and managed by the merchant, is partially outsourced to a third party, or fully outsourced to a third party results in different levels of risk for the merchant. The flow and storage of cardholder data should be accurately documented as part of this risk assessment process to ensure that all components and third parties are identified and properly secured or managed. Once implemented, e-commerce environments should be included in an organization’s annual risk-assessment process per PCI DSS Requirement 12.2.

It is recommended a merchant understand how and when a service provider will access its systems. Both the service provider and the merchant must meet PCI DSS Requirement 8.3, which requires multi-factor authentication for remote access into the merchant’s cardholder data environment. In addition, the merchant is advised to be familiar with PCI DSS Requirement 8.1.5, which relates to a service provider’s IDs on the merchant’s systems. The service provider ID should be turned on when needed and turned off as soon as access is no longer needed. This limits service-provider access to the systems to only those times the merchant knows about. This also closes the door for a malicious individual to hack in using a service provider’s credential if the access is always on. 7.5 ASV Scanning of E-commerce Environments PCI DSS Requirement 11.2 for external and internal vulnerability scanning applies to e-commerce websites because they are part of the cardholder data environment. When a merchant outsources website hosting and/or management to a third-party hosting provider, the merchant may not have control over the scanning process. ASV scans check for common vulnerabilities within the system and provide a report of those vulnerabilities. The following best practices apply to merchants using third-party hosting-commerce solutions:  Ensure that ASV scanning is being carried out as specified by PCI DSS Requirement 11.2.  If a merchant’s e-commerce site is hosted in a shared environment (more than one merchant’s website on the same server), there are two options available for scanning: o The hosting provider can undergo ASV scans on its own and provide evidence of compliant scans to the merchant; or o The hosting provider can undergo an ASV scan as part of each of its merchants’ ASV scans.  Determine whether the service provider will provide scan reports and whether the service provider will assist with any vulnerability corrections/remediation. Ultimately, it is the merchant’s responsibility to ensure its hosted environment receives a passing result on a quarterly basis from appropriately scoped ASV scans. 7.6 Penetration Testing of E-commerce Environments PCI DSS Requirement 11.3 for external and internal penetration testing applies to e-commerce environments as well. As with ASV scans, a merchant may not have control over the penetration testing process. The following best practices apply to merchants using third-party e-commerce solutions:  Ensure the service provider is conducting the annually required penetration tests per PCI DSS Requirement 11.3.  Understand and be notified when the test

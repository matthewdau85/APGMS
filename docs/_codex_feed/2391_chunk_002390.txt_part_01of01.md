Government Gazette notices concerning legislation, and other notices required by Commonwealth law to be published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, are published on the Federal Register of Legislation. A number of other specialist gazettes are published by other Australian Government agencies. Specialist gazettes may be published at varying intervals, may overlap with notices published on the Federal Register of Legislation or may publish material not available on the Federal Register of Legislation. Government Notices Gazettes (including Periodic and Special) published between 1 January 1901 and 1 October 2012 are available in PDF format on the Federal Register of Legislation, under Gazettes 1901 - September 2012 . From 1 October 2012 onwards the Gazette has been published in electronic format only as individually searchable notices. Printed copies of Government Gazettes published before 1 October 2012 are also available at State Libraries throughout Australia or the National Library in Canberra. State and Territory Governments Gazettes are published on the relevant State or Territory government website.

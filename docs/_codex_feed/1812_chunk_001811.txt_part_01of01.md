We want to give our people the opportunity to be there for the things that are important to them, their family and community. AP+ Extra Leave days are available to permanent employees and allow our people to take that mid-week break or long weekend to recharge and unwind, a day off to celebrate special occasions, help out at the kids’ school event, participate in cultural celebrations/events, commemorate religious holy days, or focus on their health and wellbeing. At AP+ we’re committed to providing a range of leave options to enable our people to live their best life.

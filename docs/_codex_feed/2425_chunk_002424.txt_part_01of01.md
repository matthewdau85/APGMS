This page provides updates on the Register. 19 September 2025 All Versions Tab The All Versions tab has been changed to reorganise information on the tab and to display additional information about point in time versions: 1. Future amendments The “Hide Possible Future Amendments” checkbox has been renamed to “Show Known Future Amendments” . The new label clarifies that you will only find information about amendments with a known or definite future commencement date. Information about amendments with a future commencement date that is not yet known can be found on the Interactions Tab . The default setting is unchecked which means that known future amendments will show by default. 2. Columns have been reordered and renamed . The page now includes: a. Compilation Date : Formerly “Effective Date”. This label is now consistent with the information on compilation cover pages. b. Comp no : Formerly “Comp.”. This displays the compilation number of each version. If a compilation number is unavailable for a historical title, it will appear blank. c. ID : This is a new column showing the Register ID of each compilation. Filtering according to the ID is available. d. The download version icon has been moved to a more central position on the table. e. Notes : This new column displays the (i) icon for information and a new (c) icon that identifies citation changes. Hovering over the icons displays more information. f. Includes Amendments now includes: i. Amendment titles with the Register ID of the amendment in parentheses (e.g., Legislation Act 2003 (C2004A01224)). ii. Expand/collapse toggle [>] / [˅] to show provisions/hide provisions. Other updates Using the browser Ctrl + F search functionality will no longer prevent you from navigating using the Table of Contents.

the PCI DSS. What is the PCI Secure Software Lifecycle (Secure SLC) Standard? Troy Leach: One of the most important aspects of the PCI Software Security Framework and a consistent issue highlighted in recent compromises is maintaining good application security as changes are introduced. The Secure SLC Standard helps achieve this by outlining security requirements and assessment procedures for software vendors to validate how they properly manage the security of payment software throughout the entire software lifecycle. Key security principles addressed in the Secure SLC Standard include governance, threat identification, vulnerability detection and mitigation, security testing, change management, secure software updates, and stakeholder communications. This provides confidence to businesses using the payment application that their software vendor is providing ongoing assurance to the integrity of the software development and confidentiality of payment data as change occurs. How will the PCI Secure SLC Standard be used? Troy Leach: The PCI Secure SLC Standard is intended for software vendors that develop software for the payments industry. Validation against the Secure SLC Standard illustrates that a software vendor has mature secure software lifecycle management practices in place to ensure its payment software is designed and developed to protect payment transactions and data, minimize vulnerabilities, and defend against attacks. Achieving this validation demonstrates an understanding and commitment to those continuous changes throughout a payment application’s lifecycle. Who will assess software and vendors to the new software security standards? Troy Leach: Assessor programs are being developed to support these standards as part of the PCI Software Security Framework. We will provide more information on these new programs over the next few months. What resources are available to help stakeholders understand the new standards? Troy Leach: In addition to the guidance contained within the standards, a separate FAQ document is provided to address key questions stakeholders may have as they review the standards. A dedicated Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms has also been produced for the Software Security Framework to assist with understanding of software-specific terminology used throughout the standards.

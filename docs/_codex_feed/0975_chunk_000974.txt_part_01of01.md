isn't an update to that one. It builds on scoping and segmentation, but through the lens of modern network architecture. The second point is that PCI DSS version 4.x can secure a variety of modern network architectures out in the wild now. So, environments that employ network virtualization technologies such as service meshes, software defined networking, or innovative software deployment models, infrastructures code, zero trust architectures. Regardless of the modern network architecture the organization deploys, certain factors should remain consistent to ensure effective PCI DSS scoping and segmentation practices. These include the consistent application of documented policies, strong identity and access management practices, and a solid understanding of where the data is stored and how it flows. This understanding is fundamental to PCI DSS scoping and segmentation practices and should be a priority in any network architecture decision. With these components, applying PCI DSS controls in any of these modern network architectures can be achieved without compromising innovation. Alicia Malone: That's wonderful, Kandyce. I know a lot of work went into this document and you must be so proud of the results. And so, we're so glad to have you here today to really help explain what went into producing this document and all of the details involved in it. And of course, since you're on Coffee with the Council , I would be remiss if I didn't ask you how you take your coffee or if you're not a coffee drinker, what do you prefer instead? Kandyce Young: I certainly am a coffee drinker, and I take my coffee black, but maybe a splash of almond milk if it's around. But when I was working on this SIG guidance document, I certainly did incorporate a shot of espresso in it as well. Alicia Malone: I bet you did. Probably a lot of late nights. Well, thank you so much for joining us on Coffee with the Council , Kandyce. It's so insightful to learn more about the value of Special Interest Groups and the important guidance that they produce. Congratulations to you, and to the group, on a job well done in this effort. Kandyce Young: You know, it really was my pleasure, Alicia, and all of the companies involved in this document can be found in the Acknowledgements section of the document. So, I'm very thankful to each and every member for volunteering your time, effort, and considerable knowledge to making this document as meaningful as it is. So, thank you. Alicia Malone: And you can download the new information supplement PCI DSS Scoping and Segmentation Guidance for Modern Network Architectures in our Document Library on our website at PCISecurityStandards.org .

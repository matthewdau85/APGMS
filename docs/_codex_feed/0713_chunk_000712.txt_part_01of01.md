Transition For a period of 3 months commencing on the ATM Direct Charging Date an Acquirer may comply with the rules in this clause F.8 in lieu of compliance with the disclosure rules in clause F.4. F.9 Damages for Non-compliance with Direct Charging Rules (a) This clause F.9 applies to Direct Charging Systems Error. In this Code, a Direct Charging Systems Error is a systems error that: (i) causes material non-compliance with these Direct Charging Rules; and (ii) affects 10 or more ATM Transactions. (b) Each IA Participant agrees that the amount of $7,500.00 is a conservative and genuine pre-estimate of the total loss that all IA Participants that are ATM Issuers will suffer as a result of a Direct Charging Systems Error. (c) If a Direct Charging Systems Error occurs, then: (i) the loss suffered by each IA Participant that is an Issuer (Issuer Framework Participant) as a result is presumed to be $7,500 multiplied by the IA Participant’s Issuing Share where “Issuing Share” means an IA Participant’s Cards Market Share (as defined in the Company’s Constitution) attributable to its activities as an Issuer; and (ii) the IA Participant responsible for the ATMs affected by the Direct Charging System Error (“Responsible Framework Participant”) must: (A) pay Company the sum of $7,500.00 multiplied by the IA Participant’s Issuing Share; and (B) rectify the Direct Charging Systems Error as soon as practicable. 78 Amended effective 1/1/16, version 002 r&p 002.15 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 6 – ATM SYSTEM CODE ANNEXURE F. DIRECT CHARGING RULES Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 101 (d) All sums received by the Company pursuant to sub-clause (c)(ii)(A) above must be applied by the Company to operating costs and expenses which would otherwise be borne by Framework Participants pursuant to the IAC Regulations. (e) The presumption in sub-clause (c)(i) above will cease to apply between the Responsible Framework Participant and an Issuer Framework Participant if either of them establish (to the satisfaction of the other or by Dispute Resolution pursuant to Part 12 of the IAC Regulations) that the liability of the Responsible Framework Participant to the Issuer Framework Participant differs from the amount prescribed by sub-clause (b). If this occurs then any amounts received by the Issuer Framework Participant pursuant to sub-clause (c) must be taken into account in determining the amount due and payable between the Responsible Framework Participant and the Issuer Framework Participant. (f) Issuers will not seek additional compensation for any loss suffered as a result of a Direct Charging Systems Error from the Responsible Framework Participant pursuant to Part 12 of the IAC Regulations. (g) Nothing in this clause F.9 affects the right of the Responsible Framework Participant to seek contribution and/or compensation for a Direct Charging Systems Error from a party with whom it has a third party agreement. F.10 Prohibition on hindering or preventing Direct Charging (a) Where an Acquirer wishes to Direct Charge in respect of ATM Transactions with a Cardholder of an ATM Issuer, the Issuer must not engage in conduct that hinders or prevents that Acquirer from Direct Charging. (b) For the avoidance of doubt, clause F.10(a) does not prevent an Issuer from charging its Cardholders a fee for an ATM Transaction.

G.3 Transactions support and processing Mandatory supported Transactions are: (a) withdrawal; (b) balance; and (c) reversals of above. Support for other Transaction types for “on-us Transactions” e.g., purchase, transfer, bill payment and top up is optional at Issuer discretion.

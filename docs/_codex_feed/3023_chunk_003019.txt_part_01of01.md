Some things for a merchant to consider in specifying its needs (and to consider adding to an RFI/RFP) include: a) Authentication method (Refer to Section 4.1, “Certificate types (DV, OV, EV) and associated risks.”) b) Core SSL/TLS certificate capabilities/features: i. Authentication methods (DV, OV, EV) ii. Support for Subject Alternative Name (SAN), wildcards, Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) iii. Validity period iv. 128/256-bit encryption v. Support for multiple currently-approved (by NIST or PCI) encryption algorithms vi. Support for multiple key lengths based on currently-approved (by NIST or PCI) encryption ciphers vii. Breadth of browser support viii. Re-issuance of certificates c) Optional/added-value capabilities/features of a CA: i. Trust seal(s) provided by CA as an additional form of “signaling” to the user that its website has been authenticated and is encrypted, as well as to increase conversions and to decrease shopping-cart abandonment. CA’s seal-related infrastructure/services should be subject to the industry-standard security controls—e.g., delivered via HTTPS and tested for no vulnerabilities. ii. Scanning for malware or vulnerabilities Note: these scans do not take the place of a PCI- approved ASV scan, which comes with an “Attestation of Scan Compliance.” iii. Certificate management: console, discovery, renewal iv. Third-party certificate management—inventory, certificate characteristics, violation of corporate policy (e.g., weak algorithms, expiration too long), identification of certificate misuse, etc. d) Pricing: i. Brand-related pricing ii. Authentication method-related pricing iii. Volume discount-related pricing iv. Validity period-related pricing v. Support level-related pricing Information Supplement • Best Practices for Securing E-commerce • April 2017 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

For those who are looking for tools or services with different functionality or need to address organizations with larger, more complex, environments, consider commercially available services and tools with features such as these:”.:  Check the certificate (common name, key size/type, certificate transparency, validity period). o These checks ensure the common name syntax is correct, the key size meets the minimum length requirements, the type is valid (e.g., RSA or ECC), the certificate transparency timestamp is included, and the validity period does not exceed the maximum allowed.  Check the certificate chain, intermediate CA, and root CA. o These checks verify that the certificate has a proper chain, and that the chain is to a known intermediate and public root.  Check for supported ciphers and protocols, and any vulnerabilities. o These checks verify that the cryptographic cyphers and protocols are of the allowed type.  Check for OpenSSL vulnerabilities  Check for server vulnerabilities It is recommended that merchants schedule periodic tests to ensure the quality of the TLS certificate implementation and to also schedule tests after changes to certificates, web servers, load balancers/application delivery controllers, network changes and any other major change.

These certificates are also used to deliver encryption of data transmissions between the browser and the web server. Because certificates can provide both authentication and encryption, merchants need to understand those services and how the different types of certificates deliver those services. 4.1 Certificate Types (DV, OV, EV) and Associated Risks This is where authentication comes in. Authentication means, “How do I know the true identity of the merchant to which I am sending my data”? The CAs (certificate authorities) providing TLS certificates are providing three different ways of authenticating servers: domain validated (DV), organization validated (OV) and extended validation (EV) certificates. DV has the lowest cost, OV is in the middle, and EV has the highest cost. One may argue that secure e-commerce is possible only when there is a high level of trust in the transaction. How is that level of trust defined, what are the proper security criteria, and are there different types of e- commerce which merit different conditions of trust? The following paragraphs discuss certificate types and how they may be used to identify, evaluate, and authorize parties to a transaction. Please note while all certificate types may be able to meet the PCI DSS requirements for encryption of transmissions over public networks, certain certificates may not always be appropriate for a particular circumstance. For example, one type of certificate may be practical in the context of a typical business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce transaction (i.e., a website accessed by a person with a browser or mobile device), but may not apply for machine-to-machine (e.g., B2B) or an automated API-based transaction where a human is not involved. In the latter, the digital certificate is there to provide only encryption, not authentication. Only recommendations on the use of digital certificates are being presented; it will be up to

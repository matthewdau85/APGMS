Lynn Kraus appointed to lead the merged group of BPAY, eftpos and NPPA Australian Payments Plus is pleased to announce the appointment of Lynn Kraus as its future Chief Executive Officer. Ms Kraus will lead the newly formed payments organisation following the successful amalgamation of BPAY, eftpos and NPPA. “I am thrilled to be joining the team at Australian Payments Plus. I believe there is a unique opportunity to create an organisation that better serves the needs of Australian payments users today, and well into the future. Bringing together three fantastic businesses under one roof, to respond to the impacts of regulatory and technological change will deliver more efficient and co-ordinated payments solutions for Australian consumers and businesses,” said Ms Kraus. “AP+ already has great people, brands and infrastructure in place. My priority will be to harness that talent and passion to create a more competitive and co-ordinated Australian payments organisation.” Ms Kraus is currently a Transaction Strategy & Execution Partner at EY Oceania and has over 25 years’ experience in finance and consulting and has previously worked at Westpac and Wachovia. She is highly experienced at bringing organisations together to create alignment and strategic direction. AP+ Chair Catherine Brenner said she was delighted that Lynn Kraus has been appointed as the inaugural CEO of Australian Payments Plus: “Lynn is a fantastic leader with an exemplary track record in strategic thinking and execution. The AP+ Board and I know that she is the right person to lead AP+ and work with the team of payments professionals to create a more competitive player in the Australian payments space. “Lynn is also an expert in stakeholder management and business transformation, and I know one of her first priorities will be to continue the seamless integration of eftpos, BPAY and NPPA under AP+, when the official completion date is reached in mid-February.” AP+ undertook an extensive recruitment process for the CEO role and Ms Kraus’s appointment has been endorsed by the shareholder representatives on the AP+ Board. “On behalf of AP+ I also want to thank Stephen Benton, Adrian Lovney and John Banfield for leading us all through the ACCC process and now the integration process. BPAY, eftpos and NPPA wouldn’t be the trusted brands they are today without their leadership and hard work,” said Ms Brenner. Adrian Lovney will be taking on the role of interim CEO until Lynn’s start date and the permanent Chief Operating Officer (COO) position beyond that. “Adrian has been working in the industry for many years and his passion about the future of payments in Australia will be an asset to AP+,” said Brenner.

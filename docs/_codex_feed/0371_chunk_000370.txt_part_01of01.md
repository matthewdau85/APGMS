Except as expressly provided in these Terms, and to the extent permitted by law, AusPayNet excludes all warranties (including any implied warranties), guarantees, representations and undertakings. The API User acknowledges that it uses the APIs and Data at its own discretion and risk, and the API User will be solely responsible for any damage or Loss that results from such use. a) API as an information Source The API and Data therein are provided on a ‘as is’ and ‘as available’ basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. While AusPayNet makes its best efforts to ensure the Data is accurate and up to date (including deleting Data where appropriate), AusPayNet makes no representation or gives no warranty that the Data is reliable, accurate or complete. b) Security of Information AusPayNet makes no representation or gives no warranty that access to the API is free from interruptions, time delays or Harmful Code. While AusPayNet strives to protect Data and information contained in the API, it does not warrant or provide any assurance that the security of any Data/information accessed via the API is free of Harmful Code. c) API functionality The API may be subject to version updates from time to time. AusPayNet does not warrant or represent that the functions contained in the API will meet the API User's requirements, be fit for the API User's purpose, that version updates will be backwards compatible with earlier versions or that any particular performance characteristics or general availability of the API will be retained. 9. Limitation of Liability To the maximum extent permitted by law, under no circumstances, including but not limited to negligence, will AusPayNet be liable for any Loss or damages (including, without limitation, direct, indirect, special, consequential damages or any other pecuniary loss) that result from the Page 5 of 5 use or inability to use the API, including any reliance placed on Data or other information contained in or accessed through the API or AusPayNet Website, even if AusPayNet has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 10. Indemnity The API User agrees to indemnify AusPayNet including its officers, employees and agents against all Loss(es) sustained or incurred by AusPayNet as a result of actions, claims and demands (including the cost of defending or settling any action, claim or demand) made or alleged against AusPayNet arising out of or in connection with: • the API User’s use of the APIs and/or Data; and/or • failure by the API User or its officers, employees or agents to comply with these Terms. 11. General a) Amendments AusPayNet reserves the right to update or amend these Terms from time to time. Any changes made to these Terms will become effective 5 business days after it is uploaded and notified on the AusPayNet Website. If an API User continues to access and use the API after a change to the Terms has been made effective, the continued access to and use of the API by the API User will be taken to mean that the API User has agreed to continue to be bound by the Terms as amended. b) Governing Law These Terms are governed by the laws in force in New South Wales and each API User agrees to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of that jurisdiction. c) Waiver A single or partial exercise or waiver of a right relating to these Terms does not prevent any other exercise of that right or exercise of any other right. d) Severability If any part of these Terms is illegal or unenforceable in any relevant jurisdiction, it may be severed for the purposes of that jurisdiction without affecting the enforceability of other clauses of this Agreement. e) Non assignment The API User must not assign any right or obligation under these Terms without AusPayNet’s prior written consent.

– character/field The gauge and comparator have scales to measure the skew which must be < 1.50 for characters and in any field of a codeline (refer 2.1.5). Dimensions The gauge has representations of characters at the nominal, maximum and minimum sizes. The codeline should be compared with these and if there is any doubt that the characters conform to standard, they should be checked with the pocket comparator and the grids shown in Appendix 2. This is particularly common for Letterpress and Offset printing as the operating conditions may vary to cause out of tolerance conditions. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 52 AusPayNet September 2017 A systematic deviation from standards could also be checked with the more accurate RDM OCR Qualifier and corrections made to the font by the typesetter or printer supplier. Printing Print quality covers voids, edge irregularity, extraneous ink as well as matters covered above. A preliminary examination of documents with a pocket comparator or loupe can usefully be supplemented by use of a low powered microscope if faults require a more detailed examination. Offset and Letterpress printing are prone to some print problems such as voids, edge irregularity and dimensional errors. Ribbon encoding is prone to voids or edge irregularity if the ribbon does not transfer properly. Non-impact printers are also commonly subject to extraneous ink. Voids and edge irregularities can also occur if toner levels are too low. Debossment This most commonly occurs with Ribbon encoding and Letterpress printing if the equipment is not properly setup. There are no instruments commonly available to measure debossment. No raised areas on the reverse of a codeline should be visible to the eye or able to be detected by fingertip touch. If either occurred, there would be concern about debossment being within specification. 7.5.2 Magnetic evaluation The only magnetic characteristic specified is the signal strength of the MICR print. The test equipment described above can however supplement the optical measurements and in many cases replace them. The waveforms and the peaks used for signal strength measurements are shown in Appendix 2 alongside the outlines of the character superimposed on the grid pattern. These are not specified by the standard, as there will be some variation in these waveforms dependant on the method of measurement. The ANSI X9-27 standard however specifies how the measurement is to be carried out for the purposes of signal strength and that method has been adopted by this standard. The physical measurements provided by MICR test equipment is based upon waveform analysis and deviations should be confirmed by visual methods. Experience with the test equipment and the printing method can provide confidence that the physical measurements taken can be used to check conformance to these standards. Once experience has confirmed the magnetic testing is accurate for the printing technology in use, a number of the visual checks can be replaced by the more automated magnetic tests. Magnetic testers are however poor at detecting print defects such as voids and edge irregularities hence some form of visual assessment of print quality must still be maintained. Signal Strength The common standard is the Domestic symbol (refer 2.2.10) and must be between 75% and 200%. Spacing Most instruments provide some detail of the spacing. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 53 AusPayNet September 2017 Format Most instruments can check the format against Australian specifications; errors need to be checked against the Confirmatory Authority before acceptance as incorrect. Waveform The RDM Qualifier gives very detailed waveforms and comparison with the nominal waveform. As noted above, the waveform does not form part of the standard but does provide useful information. For example skew distorts the waveform in a predictable manner and extraneous ink can easily be detected. MICR Technical Specifications V 3.3.2 P a g e | 54 AusPayNet September 2017 Appendix 1.

MICR Character Tolerances and Waveforms This Appendix shows the ideal shape each of the MICR numbers and symbols outlined against the 0.010 inch grid. The straight edges of each character should ideally run midway down the 0.003 inch space between the squares. The allowed tolerance is the edge of the adjacent square. Illustrated next to the character outline is the nominal theoretical waveform for that character, with the peak(s) used for measurement of signal strength noted. All relate to the reference peak for the Domestic symbol that is rated at 100. These waveforms are mathematically derived from a theoretical model based on the design of the MICR tester defined in ANSI X9-27 and ideal MICR characters. These characters have perfect edges and dimensions, completely uniform ink cover and the magnetisation is parallel to the plane of the paper. These waveforms are not specified as standards because commercially available test equipment and printed MICR documents cannot conform exactly to the model. These is however sufficiently good correlation between the model and actual waveforms for them to be a very useful tool in examining the quality of MICR. The signal strength derived from the reference peaks is definitely defined as a standard and is shown in the table below together with the

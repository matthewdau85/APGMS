Failure to pass any such exam, automatically disqualifies the individual as a Secure SLC Assessor and, accordingly, the employee must not perform or manage any Secure SLC Assessment until successfully passing the exam and reinstating his or her qualification. 1 ISO27001 certifications will be accepted as meeting the requirement only when certifications are issued by an accredited certification body (for example, ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB) and United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS)). Certified ISO 27001 courses should be accredited to the ISO/IEC 17024 standard. It is the responsibility of the SSF Assessor Company/candidate to ensure that the certifying body is accredited, and to provide evidence of accreditation to PCI SSC. To find out if your country has an accreditation body, visit the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) website at www.iaf.nu and use the IAF MLA signatories list to identify an accreditation body in your country or region. To find a certification body, visit the International Organization for Standardization certification information page; the section titled “Choosing a certification body” will explain how to find a certification body. Verification of company's certification should be addressed to the certification organization in question. You may also wish to contact the ISO member in your country or the country concerned, as they may have a national database of certified companies.

- N None provided Visual Payroll is an open source payroll that also includes health and safety and human resources. The system manages employee leave entitlements with change management for salary and wage increases etc. Because the system is open source it can integrate with other systems as required and would suit a company that uses an ERP or similar framework. The system is designed for companies with 100 to 500 employees but can be scaled to suit. Visual Payroll uses a workflow to manage the payroll process and is very easy for staff to learn. The system is used in many countries and tax calculations and specific requirements can be loaded depending on the business requirements. The system costs employee time to both departments and cost centers and also includes full archive reporting on previous pay records. Pay slips can be printed or emailed to employees and cost reporting is available at both department and job level. Visual Payroll has a secure login system and each user has a security level that grants access to various parts of the system. The system works with Windows Terminal Server and would suit a business that has an in house developed system that wants to integrate it to a standard Single Touch Payroll system. 43 553 010 767 Payroll Event 2018 Payroll Event 2020 Voyager DMS Gateway DMS Payroll (STP) - N http://www.gatewaydms.com.au/ - 24 607 552 545 Payroll Event 2018 Payroll Event 2020 WageEasy ACCESS SOFTWARE AUSTRALIA PTY LTD Payroll (STP) - N http://www.theaccessgroup.com/en-au/ - 40 071 007 326 Payroll Event 2018 Payroll Event 2020 WageEasy Payroll Online ACCESS SOFTWARE AUSTRALIA PTY LTD Payroll (STP) - Y http://www.theaccessgroup.com/en-au/ - 40 071 007 326 Payroll Event 2018 Payroll Event 2020 Wageloch LochSoft Pty Ltd Payroll (STP) - Y None provided Wageloch develops cloud software for staff rostering and time and attendance, with electronic interfaces to payroll, point of sale, and HR systems. 64 121 335 153 workdesk LOOKUP INNOVATIONS PTY LTD Payroll (STP) - N http://www.workdesk.com.au/ - 67 606 731 819 Payroll Event 2018 Payroll Event 2020 Xero Business Xero Australia Payroll (STP) - Y https://www.xero.com/au/ - 89 124 215 247 Payroll Event 2018 Tax File Number Declaration 2017 Tax File Number Declaration 2019 Taxable Payments Annual Report 2013 Taxable Payments Annual Report 2021 Xero Tax Xero Australia Practice Management - Y https://www.xero.com/au/ - 89 124 215 247 Activity Statement 2009 Activity Statement Client Report 2014 Assessment 2017 Assessment 2018 Client Update Client Update Relationships 2018 Closely Held Trusts TFN Report 2018 Company return 2014 Company return 2015 Company return 2016 Company return 2017 Company return 2018 Company return 2019 Company return 2020 Company return 2021 Company return 2022 Company return 2023 Company return 2024 Company return 2025 ELS Tag Format 2014 Fringe benefits tax return 2015 Fringe benefits tax return 2016 Fringe benefits tax return 2017 Fringe benefits tax return 2018 Fringe benefits tax return 2019 Fringe benefits tax return 2020 Fringe benefits tax return 2021 Fringe benefits tax return 2022 Fringe benefits tax return 2023 Fringe benefits tax return 2024 Fringe benefits tax return 2025 Individual Income Tax Returns 2014 Individual Income Tax Returns 2015 Individual Income Tax Returns 2016 Individual Income Tax Returns 2017 Individual Income Tax Returns 2018 Individual Income Tax Returns 2019 Individual Income Tax Returns 2020 Individual Income Tax Returns 2021 Individual Income Tax Returns 2022 Individual Income Tax Returns 2023 Individual income tax returns 2024 Individual income tax returns 2025 Income Tax Client Report (ITCRPT) 2014 Partnership tax return 2014 Partnership tax return 2015 Partnership tax return 2016 Partnership tax return 2017 Partnership tax return 2018 Partnership tax return 2019 Partnership tax return 2020 Partnership tax return 2021 Partnership tax return 2022 Partnership tax return 2023 Partnership tax return 2024 Partnership tax return 2025 SMSF Annual Return 2014 SMSF Annual Return 2015 SMSF Annual Return 2016 SMSF Annual Return 2017 SMSF Annual Return 2018 SMSF Annual Return 2019 SMSF Annual Return 2021 SMSF Annual Return 2022 SMSF Annual Return 2023 SMSF Annual Return 2024 SMSF Annual Return 2025 Tax File Number Declaration 2019 Tax Practitioner Manage Agent Trust 2014 Trust tax return 2014 Trust tax return 2015 Trust tax return 2016 Trust tax return 2017 Trust tax return 2018 Trust tax return 2019 Trust tax return 2020 Trust tax return 2021 Trust tax return 2022 Trust tax return 2023 Trust tax return 2024 Trust tax return 2025 Xpect CIBIS International Pty Ltd Payroll (STP) - Y http://www.cibis.com.au Xpect offers SMEs a contemporary cloud-based 'mini-ERP' with full accounting and payroll capabilities without the complexity or costs of a global ERP. 58 126 017 310 Payroll Event 2018 Payroll Event 2020 YNA Online Your Nursing Agency Pty Ltd Payroll (STP) - Y http://www.yna.com.au - 70 135 579 127 Payroll Event 2018 Payroll Event 2020 Zambion Pty Ltd Zambion Pty Ltd Payroll (STP) - Y https://zambion.com/ - 46 142 754 809 Payroll Event 2018 Payroll Event 2020 Zavanti ZAVANTI AUSTRALIA PTY LTD Payroll (STP) Small Large N http://www.zavanti.com/ - 70 110 183 974 Payroll Event 2018 Payroll Event 2020 Tax Automate PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS Income Tax Returns - Non-Individual - Y https://www.pwc.com.au/ - 52 780 433 757 Activity Statement 2009 Company return 2020 Company return 2021 Company return 2022 Company return 2023 Company return 2024 Company return 2025 Fringe Benefits Tax Return 2025 Fund income tax return 2021 Fund income tax return 2022 Fund income tax return 2023 Fund income tax return

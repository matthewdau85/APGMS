to do this is adopting and implementing the latest version of the PCI DSS, as summarized below. A link to the full version of the document is available in Appendix G. PCI Data Security Standard – High-Level Overview Build and Maintain a Secure Network 1. Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data 2. Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters Protect Cardholder Data 3. Protect stored cardholder data 4. Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program 5. Protect all systems against malware and regularly update anti-virus software or programs 6. Develop and maintain secure systems and applications Implement Strong Access Control Measures 7. Restrict access to cardholder data by business need to know 8. Identify and authenticate access to system components 9. Restrict physical access to cardholder data Regularly Monitor and Test Networks 10. Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data 11. Regularly test security systems and processes Maintain an Information Security Policy 12. Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel In addition, an entity can reduce risk and reduce its attractiveness to criminals by devaluing account data through tokenization, making card data unreadable or by reducing its scope of where the PCI DSS applies. The following section looks at some of the techniques available to reduce PCI DSS scope.

Whichever methods are used, the goal is to ensure that SAD is never stored after the transaction is authorized, and account data is secured and/or removed from systems and storage. As a starting point, consider whether the organization should aim at excluding telephone-based card payment data entirely. This approach may be part of a structured business strategy to reduce risk by not accepting telephone payments. For organizations that receive very small volumes of telephone payments and perhaps already have a secure alternative payment channel—for example, a PCI DSS compliant e-commerce channel—this approach may provide a simple solution to mitigating a real business risk by avoiding the risk altogether. For organizations committed to taking payments over the telephone, consideration should be given to techniques that minimize exposure of PAN and SAD to the telephone environment and balance that with user/customer experience requirements, with the object of significantly reducing the CDE or eliminating the CDE altogether. Outsourcing to PCI DSS validated service providers may be considered as an option for securing telephone environments. Please see Section 7 for further guidance. For organizations accepting telephone-based payments, reducing PCI DSS scope through network segmentation and then applying all 12 Requirements to the reduced environment remains a valid technique for securing the telephone environment. It is recommended that organizations refer to the Information Supplement, Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation, mentioned in Appendix G. The types of agent interaction are discussed in the next sections; however, for all types of agent interaction, consideration must be given to how and where account data is transmitted, processed, or stored. Technologies and processes may also be implemented to restrict the presence of account data to a limited number of systems, helping to reduce the size of the CDE.

In terms of customer experience or contact type, technologies can be classified as being one of the following types:  Attended – Where the entity remains in direct voice contact with its customer for the entire duration of the telephone payment transaction.  Unattended – Where the entity does not remain in direct voice contact with its customer for the entire duration of the telephone payment transaction, and all or part of telephone payment component of the call is handled by a different technology pathe.g., IVR or some type of redirection to a web payment process. In terms of technology dependency on the entity’s telephone infrastructure, technologies can be further classified as either:  Telephony based – Where the technology application is wholly dependent on the entity’s telephony infrastructure, effectively using voice or DTMF tones, through the use of the telephone keypad, to facilitate the transaction.  Digital based – Where the technology application sends a message or email to the customer with a link to a PCI DSS compliant web-based payment page where the customer is invited to input their PAN and SAD using a connected device such as smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer. Both telephony-based and digital technology-based types are capable of supporting both attended and unattended customer-experience options. In addition, all four classifications of technology type (Telephony Attended, Digital Attended,

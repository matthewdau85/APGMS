Yes No N/A If N/A response: Reason (u) Documented procedures exist and are followed to ensure if keys are loaded or transported using an electronic key loading device then:105 The key loading device is a device approved by an Approved Standard Entity with an Accepted Standard; Reference IAC Code Set Volume 3, clause 2.3.1(a). The key loading device is under the supervision of a person authorised by management, or is stored in a secure manner (e.g. in a safe) such that no unauthorised person may have access to it; and Reference IAC Code Set Volume 3, clause 3.4(b) and ISO 13491.2, clause F.3. The key loading device is designed or controlled so that only authorised personnel under dual control can utilise and enable it to output a key into another SCD. Such personnel ensure that the transfer is not being monitored, e.g., that there is no key recording device inserted between the SCDs.

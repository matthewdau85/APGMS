confirm that all non-complying forms have been recalled, and destroyed. For partial print runs of 20,000 forms or less, from an order of over 20,000, each print run is to be treated for evaluation purposes as if it is for an order of greater than 20,000. 1.4 Document Sizes The maximum and minimum dimensions (excluding butts and/or other attachments) for all documents, except Transfer Credit Forms (see Section 3.3), must be in accordance with Figure 1. Equipment used for MICR and Image processing systems is capable of handling documents of any size within the limits of :- Length: 6 1/4" (159 mm) up to 8 1/4" (210 mm) Height: 2 9/16" (64 mm) up to 3 2/3" (93 mm ) Amended, effective 13/09/11 Paragraph deleted, effective 28/06/04 All horizontal dimensions are measured from the right edge, all vertical dimensions from the Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 12 AusPayNet September 2017 bottom edge. It is therefore important that these edges must form a right angle and be true in every way. Envelopes used to mail cheques and deposit forms should be of an Australia Post preferred size and designed to accommodate documents without folding. For window-faced envelopes see Section 7.1.

Paragraph amended (editorial changes), effective 28/06/04 Advances in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) have made it possible to improve the automation of financial document processing by means of image technology. This technology provides the route for the conversion of documents into a digitised format for electronic processing, and storage by using computer hardware and software. Electronic imaging of financial documents places requirements on the overall design of documents so that they are readily legible when viewing the image of a document, rather than the document itself. Documents properly designed for imaging ensure that all essential information will be captured by the imaging process, the images will be useable and legible, and that the file sizes of images will be low enough so that they can be stored and moved in a cost efficient manner. Paragraph amended (editorial changes), effective 28/06/04 The capture of paper-based documents is via a scanner. ICR is used to read hand-written or machine-printed amounts on documents, and an image of the document may be archived in a scanned format on optical discs, CD ROM or other electronic storage media to facilitate retrieval. Not all printed documents can be successfully reproduced as an image by scanning mechanisms. This is mainly due to the depth of shade, or colour of the ink used in the printing process. Dark colours usually reproduce as black, and most pastel colours do not reproduce at all. Written or printed text on a dark background will be difficult to detect as the writing blends into the background. Conversely, text will be clearly visible on a pastel background as the text will be seen, but the background will not. All information that is to be retained, whether printed on the original document, hand-written, stamped or machine-printed, must thus be printed in a colour that will be seen by the scanner. Printed inks can be classified as scan readable or scan non-readable. Inks whose properties fall in the mid-range between scan readable and scan non-readable should be avoided as they can make the document difficult to read by imaging techniques. Boxes or lines around the area where the amount in figures/total amount are entered on documents can create recognition problems for OCR and ICR and hence such boxes or lines must be printed as scan non-readable. The level of recognition of inks by scanners is dealt with in Appendices A and B 1.5.2 Design Requirements for Image Technology The process of imaging documents eliminates colour in the conversion of a paper document to a captured image. Accordingly, printing financial documents adds some unique requirements, over and above those normally required for human viewing, to preserve reliable recognition of data elements. Since colour is lost, detection and recognition of information is highly dependent on the contrast between the written information and the printed background. In image processing a process of dynamic thresholding is often used to retain this vital information and discard the background. This specification provides measurement methodologies to predict the outcome of dynamic thresholding, and ensures legibility and efficient processing of the documents. See Appendix B for more details. Successful imaging and recognition can be affected by many factors in the document design, Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 15 AusPayNet September 2017 including background colour, screening, background pattern of the document, security patterns, and the ink used to print the data. The effect of all these can be assessed by reflectance and contrast measurements. The dynamic thresholding method of measuring reflectance and contrast has been found to be superior to Print Contrast Signal measurements and is given consideration in this standard. Analysis tools that utilise images eliminate operator induced error as there will be no interpretation required

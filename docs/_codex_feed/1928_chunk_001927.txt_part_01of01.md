Australian Payments Plus (AP+) is continuing to step up its efforts to make payments safer, faster, and more secure, by building scam prevention into the infrastructure that underpins everyday payments. Bringing together eftpos, BPAY, and real-time payments platform the NPP (best known through brands like PayID, PayTo and Osko), AP+ plays a central role in shaping the future of digital payments in Australia. From real-time scam detection tools to new ways of checking your money is going where you think it is, AP+ is driving trust in the payments system, and helping the digital economy stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated threats. “Stopping scams can’t be left to chance or handled after the fact. It needs to be built into how we pay, from the ground up,” said Lynn Kraus, CEO of AP+. “That’s why we’re working across the payments ecosystem to embed safeguards, so everyone in Australia can move their money with greater trust, transparency, and control.” How AP+ is helping reduce scams Launched in 2025, this industry-wide initiative adds an extra layer of protection when making payments to a BSB and account number by allowing payers to confirm the name on the account before money is sent – reducing the risk of scams and mistaken payments. PayID helps remove the risk of entering the wrong account number by letting people send money to a registered mobile number, email address or ABN. PayID reduces payment errors and helps people see who they’re paying before hitting send. PayTo agreements are authorised and visible within a customer’s banking app, giving them more control over who can debit their bank account, and helping reduce fraudulent or surprise payments. eftpos debit transactions benefit from a real-time fraud scoring system, which analyses transactional patterns and behaviours to help banks identify potentially fraudulent activity. Recent upgrades have also introduced tokenisation, replacing sensitive card data with digital tokens for online payments, making card details useless to scammers if intercepted. ConnectID helps businesses minimise the amount of sensitive personal data captured and stored to reduce the risk and impact of data breaches and identity fraud. By allowing customers to verify only essential data through an organisation they trust, like their bank, they can avoid having to collect and store identity documents like licenses or passports. Staying safe is a shared responsibility Tools like PayID, PayTo and Confirmation of Payee offer more visibility and control, but they work best when paired with simple scam-smart behaviours: think twice before clicking links, check who you’re paying, and contact your bank immediately if something doesn’t feel right. STOP Always take a moment before giving your money or personal information to anyone. Scammers will create a sense of urgency to pressure you into acting quickly. Don’t rush to make decisions about money or sharing person details CHECK Make sure the person or organisation you’re dealing with is real. Scammers pretend to be from organisations you know and trust. Always verify who you’re dealing with before taking any action PROTECT Act quickly if something feels wrong. The sooner you take action, the better you can protect yourself and others from scammers.

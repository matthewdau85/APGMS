Donations are the lifeblood of many non-profit volunteer groups. PayID provides an instant and reassured way for donors to show their support. Streets Alive Yarra is a resident and ratepayer action group focused on improving the liveability, accessibility and beauty of the City of Yarra in Victoria. Founder of the group, Jeremy Lawrence, said PayID helps to attract donations for the designs, concepts and submissions that are central to the group’s consultation and lobbying work. “We are a collective of rate-payers who are focused on increasing space for trees, as well as creating places to rest, socialise and form connections. We believe that people of all ages and abilities should be able to access any property in Yarra, irrespective of whether they choose to walk, roll on a wheelchair, cycle, use public transport, or drive.” “We started to use PayID this year when we needed a simple way for our supporters to make donations. It’s great because our supporters know they are paying the right bank account because they see the name ‘Streets Alive Yarra’ before they confirm the payment,” said Jeremy. “It gives them the reassurance they need to know that their hard-earned money is going to the cause that means a lot to them.” To learn more about Streets Alive Yarra, click here.

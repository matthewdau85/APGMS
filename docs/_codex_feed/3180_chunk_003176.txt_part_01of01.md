Instead, it shows how requirements for IoT device security capabilities – like those found in the C2 Consensus – can be considered along with the requirements of standards such as PCI DSS to help inform and secure a deployment of IoT devices across the lifecycle of those products. PCI DSS Requirement (For Deployment Environments) C2 Consensus Control (For the device)_ 1 Install and maintain network security controls 2 Apply secure configurations to all system components Secured Access 3 Protect stored account data Data At Rest Is Protected 4 Protect Cardholder Data with Strong Cryptography During Transmission Over Open, Public Networks Data In Transit Is Protected Industry Accepted Protocols are Used for Communications 5 Protect all systems and networks from malicious software 6 Develop and maintain secure systems and software Data Validation Patchability 7 Restrict access to system components and cardholder data by business need to know Secured Access 8 Identify users and authenticate access to system components Device Identifiers 9 Restrict physical access to cardholder data 10 Log and monitor all access to system components and cardholder data Event Logging 11 Test security of systems and networks regularly 12 Support information security with organizational policies and programs Reprovisioning This mapping shows that strong network controls and monitoring remain vital for secure IoT deployments. Use of network intrusion detection, which is IoT aware, and consideration for the protocols used by IoT devices is important. For example, many IoT devices communicate using wireless communications methods not common in traditional IT deployments – such as Zigbee. Traditional anti- virus may not be easily deployed to IoT systems, but host-based intrusion detection and prevent mechanisms may help mitigate the risks posed if correctly deployed and managed. Secure Deployment and Management of IoT Systems As with all security, IoT security is constantly evolving; new threats emerge, and new vulnerabilities are discovered. To protect networks from the risk of insecure IoT systems, choose secure devices and deploy and securely maintain those devices until they are decommissioned. IoT devices often provide a range of features and functions which require network and Internet based access. However, not all these features may be required, or even desired, in an IoT deployment. When 4 considering deployment for an IoT system it is important to understand what required features of any IoT systems are, and plan accordingly. For example, an IoT product feature that requires Internet access may not be desired – but if deployed without any Internet access, the product may not be able to download and install firmware updates, potentially increasing the risk posed by that device. Some IoT deployments may not require the network features be enabled at all – for example, a TV may be deployed for use in a meeting room but have no need for the network features it provides. Even in these cases, it is important to consider the security and deployment methods; for example, if someone connects the device to the network themselves, is that now a risk (because an unpatched and potentially insecure device is now connected to the corporate network)? If so, how is this risk best mitigated or controlled? Often it can be helpful to have separate network segments for different IoT systems and use these to isolate them from other systems on your network. Consider the use of a layered network design, where devices with less security assurance are in isolated network segments. Any access that is required can be provided, but with suitable additional controls. Products that cannot be sufficiently secured may be treated in the same way as ‘guests,’ and given their own network, completely isolated from other devices and systems, if the functions that require access are still needed (like the common ‘guest’ network implementation). Example of a Layered Network Architecture to isolate IoT Systems Maintaining updates for IoT products is important, as they are as vulnerable to new threats as any other IT product. However, not all IoT products are supplied with regular and on-going security patches. When considering purchase of a new IoT system, the total cost of ownership should be taken into account, and this includes the ability to maintain the product securely over time – a less expensive product may be more costly in the long term if you need to replace it sooner than others, as it is no longer being supplied with patches and may become a way for criminals to enter your network. 5 Planning of Decommissioning It is common for IoT systems to require some form of personalization during their deployment; from configuration with Wi-Fi settings through to details about the users, and installation of certificates to provide secure network access. This information can often be sensitive and important to remove prior to disposal of the IoT device; if a malicious party was to obtain a device used in your network, could they extract the network certificates or details, and use that as part of an attack? It’s vital that there are plans for the decommissioning of devices once they are no longer required or need to be replaced. The C2 Consensus

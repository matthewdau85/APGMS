Payments reforms Consultation on mandating cash acceptance In February, AusPayNet responded to Treasury’s consultation on a proposed mandate for certain businesses supplying essential goods and services to accept cash as a payment method. AusPayNet's submission welcomed the Government’s commitment to ensuring that cash remains a viable means of payment for individuals in our society who want or need to use it. In this context, we acknowledged the Government’s concerns about the negative implications that could arise if an increasing number of businesses chose to no longer accept cash in the future. We understand that the cash acceptance mandate has been proposed as a proactive step to protect cash acceptance while it remains widespread, avoiding potentially higher costs of intervention in the future if infrastructure needs to be rebuilt. At the same time, we highlighted that the effectiveness of such a mandate — or any alternative policy options to achieve the intended policy outcomes — would depend crucially on several factors. Our submission explained that: The effectiveness of a cash acceptance mandate will be critically dependent on the ongoing provision of reliable and efficient cash access and distribution infrastructure for both consumers and businesses. While the small business exemption would help protect smaller merchants from disproportionate costs, it may have unintended consequences for competition and the certainty of cash acceptance in some communities, undermining the policy objectives. There are limitations to relying on cash as a means of safeguarding payments system resilience during technology outages or natural disaster events, so broader work to enhance payments system resilience remains essential. The definition and scope of 'essential’ goods and services requires further consideration and clarification, particularly for businesses that sell both essential and non-essential items. A mandate would need to include appropriate provisions and flexibility to address any potential security risks and operational challenges, including through value- and time-based limits on cash acceptance requirements. The effectiveness of a mandate will also depend on robust monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, and the flexibility to review and adapt the framework over time to ensure it remains fit-for-purpose. Cross-border payments The Financial Stability Board (FSB) continues with its Work Programme for 2025 . While more than half the actions under the FSB’s Roadmap have been completed, there is still significant work to be done to achieve the Roadmap’s goals of faster, cheaper, more transparent and more inclusive cross-border payments. The FSB will reframe its strategy to focus on identifying and addressing the challenges to implementing the Roadmap actions, and it will strengthen its engagement with the private sector. Industry taskforces CPMI’s Payments Interoperability and Extension (PIE) Taskforce published a webinar on its task teams’ work and planned deliverables in 2025. The most recent meeting of the PIE Taskforce (in January 2025) was the final meeting to be held with the current member composition. CPMI is seeking to renew the PIE Taskforce by inviting market stakeholders to join. The FSB has not published any summary or action points of its Legal, Regulatory and Supervisory (LRS) Taskforce since April 2024. However, the FSB published two relevant papers in December, discussed more broadly in our Cross-Border Payments Round-up – March 2025 , along with several other developments in cross-border payments. Interlinking fast payment systems For many years, the Bank for International Settlements’ Singapore Innovation Hub has been working on Project Nexus . Project Nexus is designed to standardise the way that domestic fast payment systems (FPS) connect internationally, to improve the speed, cost and transparency of cross-border payments. To implement the vision of Project Nexus, Nexus Global Payments was recently established, marking a new beginning in scaling the delivery of cross-border interlinked domestic FPS, as these systems are only required to connect once to Nexus to gain access to all other countries in the network. Economic crime We welcome the findings of the National Anti-Scam Centre’s (NASC’s) annual Targeting Scams report , specifically concerning the continued reduction in scam losses and reports. According to the NASC’s report, scam losses fell by a further 26 per cent in 2024, after falling 13 per cent in 2023, indicating the Australian ecosystem effort model is working. Our CEO, Andy White, continues to represent AusPayNet on the NASC Advisory Board. Following the recent passage through Parliament and commencement of the Scams Prevention Framework Act 2025 , we stand ready to work with ASIC and the ACCC to develop the supporting codes and rules. Economic Crime Forum (ECF) The latest ECF was held in Melbourne on 25 February, coinciding with the national law enforcement meetings. The ECF agreed to develop two workgroups to: Develop a national week of action targeting money mules Clarify and determine the pathways for financial institutions to dispose of suspected proceeds of crime when mule accounts are closed or blocked. On 2 April, the post-ECF briefing was provided to electing members, with over 100 participants. The briefing attracted strong participation and support for the two ECF workgroups. Global Anti-Scam Alliance AusPayNet has joined the Global Anti-Scam Alliance (GASA) as a Supporting Member. Head of Economic Crime, Toby Evans, represents AusPayNet on the Oceania Chapter Board, which is looking at the impact of scam compounds and

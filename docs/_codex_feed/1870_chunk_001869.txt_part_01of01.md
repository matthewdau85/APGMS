A new API Framework has been released by NPP Australia that will help enable a wide range of organisations to develop innovative payments experiences that can use the New Payments Platform’s (NPP) capabilities. According to CEO of NPP Australia Adrian Lovney, the API Framework will open the door to the NPP’s infrastructure in a way that promotes standardisation, inter-operability and a consistent NPP experience. “What makes the NPP stand apart from other real-time payments platforms around the world is that it has been designed to be inclusive and ‘open access’. It’s important that companies and innovators can use its world leading capabilities in a way that promotes usability and growth across the entire NPP ecosystem”. “This framework will help third party service providers, software developers and participating financial institutions to tap into the benefits and capabilities of the NPP via APIs in a way that ensures interoperability and consistency, regardless of the type of innovation they are focused on,” said Adrian. Jointly developed by NPP Australia and SWIFT , the API Framework defines the key technical approach and mandatory data attributes for NPP APIs, aligned to ISO 20022 standards. The initial version of the Framework contains samples for three APIs, which illustrate how the framework can be used: PayID Resolution Request Payment Initiation Request Payment Status Request The NPP API Framework will be extended over time and work on version 2.0, which will cover additional sample APIs related to notification, payment cancellation and return requests, is already underway.

On this page: The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) is the single global standard for the collection, reporting and exchange of financial account information on foreign tax residents. Banks and other financial institutions use the CRS due diligence rules to review their accounts, identify those held by non-residents and report the relevant information to the ATO. That information will then be exchanged with the participating foreign tax authorities of those non-residents. In parallel, the ATO will receive eligible financial account information on Australian residents from other countries' tax authorities. This will help ensure that Australian residents with financial accounts in other countries are complying with Australian tax law and act as a deterrent to tax evasion. In Australia, the CRS Reportable Financial Institutions (RFIs) include banks and other deposit taking institutions, custodial institutions, investment entities, and specified insurance companies. Reports from Australian RFIs include data from January to December and are due annually, by 31 July in the following year. The CRS is part of a broader suite of international measures aimed at combating tax avoidance through more comprehensive exchanges of information between countries (for example, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and Country-by-Country Reporting (CbC) .

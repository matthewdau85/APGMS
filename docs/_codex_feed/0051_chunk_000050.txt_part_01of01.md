The Roundtable agreed to meet every four-to-six weeks. The Roundtable’s plan for engaging directly with relevant stakeholders.

Relevant stakeholders include members of BECS and NPP, operators of other payments schemes, end-user groups, and other relevant subject matter experts. Progress on the vision for the desired future state of A2A payments in Australia. The Roundtable welcomed the high volume of submissions to the joint consultation issued by AusPayNet and AP+ on the vision, and the diversity of stakeholder views represented in these submissions.

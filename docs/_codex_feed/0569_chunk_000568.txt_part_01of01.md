is generated on the financial transaction request message using the MAC session key (KMACs). 2. The acquirer verifies the MAC using the MAC session key (KMACr). 3. If the acquirer is the card issuer for the transaction (or is standing in for the card issuer), the customer’s PIN is verified using the issuer’s PIN verification key. Otherwise the transaction is switched to the card issuer for PIN verification - this is the case illustrated above, where the PIN block is translated to encryption under the KPEs for the issuer. The KPE used to decrypt the incoming PIN block for verification or translation is derived from the KPP, STAN, and amount, as on the Terminal. 4. The acquirer generates a MAC on the financial transaction response message using the MAC session key (KMACs). 5. The Terminal verifies the MAC on the financial transaction response message using the MAC session key (KMACr). F.7 Glossary 3DES Triple DES encipherment, performed by three 56-bit DES operations. Same as DEA 3 if 112-bit keys are used (as they are in SCM Spec). AES Advanced Encryption Standard - a new encryption algorithm which is the US standard to replace DES. AMB Australian Major Banks - an industry standard set of SCM functions. AusPayNet Australian Payments Network Limited - the industry body which regulates EFT interchange. AusPayNet TSSC The AusPayNet Technical Security Sub-Committee - a committee of security experts from the Australian EFT industry.70 CBC Cipher Block Chaining - a mode of operation of DEA 1 or DEA 3 in which each 64-bit block of enciphered data is dependent on the previous block. DEA 1 Data Encipherment Algorithm with 56-bit keys, same as DES. DEA 3 Data Encipherment Algorithm with 112-bit keys, performed by three 56-bit DEA 1 operations. DES Data Encryption Standard algorithm with 56-bit keys. Double-length Key A 128-bit cryptographic key of which 112-bits are used for encipherment, 16 bits for parity checking. 70 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 4 - DEVICE REQUIREMENTS AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT ANNEXURE F. INTRODUCTION TO DEVICE SUPPORT AND SCM FUNCTIONALITY Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 45 ECB Electronic Code Book - a mode of operation of DEA 1 and DEA 3 in which each 64-bit block of data is enciphered independently. EPP Encrypting PIN Pad - the component of an ATM which captures PINs and performs cryptographic functions. Host The processing system which drives ATM and EFTPOS Terminals. It runs EFT application software and sends function requests to an SCM.71 Interchange The exchange of EFT messages between acquirers of EFT transactions and card issuers. Inversion In the context of proof-of-endpoint, inversion of a random number, shown by the symbol “~”, means a ones complement operation, equivalent to exclusive OR with the hexadecimal constant FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. KEK Key Encipherment Key - a cryptographic key used to encipher another cryptographic key. Key Management The secure exchange and storage of cryptographic keys. Keyblock A data structure used to store enciphered cryptographic keys. KM A Master Key, stored in an SCM, which is used to encipher cryptographic keys stored on the host. KM index The ordinal number of a particular master key (KM), in an SCM which can hold more than one master key. KVC Key Verification Code. A value, derived from a cryptographic key, which is used to verify that the key is correct. Same as KVC. KVV Key Verification Value. A value, derived from a cryptographic key, which is used to verify that the key is correct. Same as KVV. SCM Security Control Module - a physically secure server which performs cryptographic functions. SCM Spec The SCM specification published by AusPayNet TSSC to support 3DES.72 SWK Switch Working Key, key used to encrypt all PIN blocks during internal processing on an EFT switch. Session key A cryptographic key used for a session of limited duration before being replaced, under dynamic key management. Single-length Key A 64-bit cryptographic key of which 56-bits are used for encipherment, 8 bits for parity checking. 71 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 72 Amended effective 20/8/18, version 007 r&p 001.18 IAC CODE SET VOLUME 4 - DEVICE REQUIREMENTS AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT ANNEXURE F. INTRODUCTION TO DEVICE SUPPORT AND SCM FUNCTIONALITY Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 46 Variant A constant which is used to modify a KEK or KM before it is used to encipher another key, to enforce key separation. Different types of key are enciphered with different variants, so that they can only be used in the appropriate SCM functions.

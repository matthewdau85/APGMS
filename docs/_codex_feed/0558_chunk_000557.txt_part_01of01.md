is translated from encryption/signing under RSA(s) to encryption under KM for local key database storage; (ii) both KEK Send and KEK Receive are stored in the required location in the key database; ensuring that the corresponding KEK KVC matches on both sides; (iii) the interchange is started using the new Interchange KEK keys. (g) The corresponding SCM functions are: C500 GETPUBLIC, C600 NODEKEKSEND, C610 NODEKEKREC. (h) Advantages (i) This method does not require any specific update/integration on the application part. i.e., the use of RSA is completely transparent to the application and therefore all Interchange parties can exchange keys through this method without any proprietary changes to their native application (as long as they have the required functions in their SCM). (ii) There is significant current experience with this method more so than with the other two random KEK methods - this method has proved to be very efficient and reliable in practice. (i) Disadvantages (i) The main operational disadvantage is the dependency upon a particular (“dedicated”) security device. In a generic case there is no guarantee that the used RSA key pair, from a particular SCM device, has not changed since the last key exchange, e.g., if the device was reset or a new device installed. Therefore the interchange key (KEK) change process requires exchange of RSA keys every time. For this reason this method is currently implemented as an off-line process and as such it is not recommended for automation. IAC CODE SET VOLUME 4 - DEVICE REQUIREMENTS AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT PART 4 CRYPTOGRAPHIC STANDARDS AND KEY MANAGEMENT Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 15 4.6.4 KTK Method (a) This method relies on a transport 3DES key that is provided to the SCMs of both Interchange partners and used to encrypt the Interchange KEKs. For key loading, KTK will typically be presented in multiple XOR key components and each partner will contribute to its construction supplying at least one component. (b) In the AusPayNet SCM specification SCMs, the functions used are D501 KEKGEN-6.3 and D502 KEKREC-6.3. (c) When generated on request, the Interchange key (KEK Send) is encrypted under the KTK and submitted to the partner where it needs to be translated into the form required by the application (encryption under the KM). For the receiving partner it will become KEK Receive. (d) The key exchange procedure is the following: (i) each interchange partner generates at least one KTK component and submits it through a secure channel to the corresponding Interchange partner for loading into an SCM; (ii) KTK is loaded by each partner; (iii) the KVCs are verified; (iv) each partner generates their KEK Send, that is cryptographically protected under KTK; (v) each partner submits the protected (encrypted) KEK Send to the partner (typically by secure email); (vi) the received KEK becomes KEK Receive. KEK Receive is translated from encryption under KTK to encryption under KM for local key database storage; (vii) both KEK Send and KEK Receive are stored in the required location in the key database; ensuring that the corresponding KVC matches on both sides; (viii) the interchange is re-started using the new Interchange keys. (e) Advantages For parties that cannot support RSA keys either functionally or by security policy, this is a simple reliable ‘traditional’ approach. Its impact to the application design is the same as for the RSA native method, i.e., either method may be used transparently to the application as long as the SCM interface utility supports the corresponding SCM calls. IAC CODE SET VOLUME 4 - DEVICE REQUIREMENTS AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT PART 4 CRYPTOGRAPHIC STANDARDS AND KEY MANAGEMENT Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 16 (f) Disadvantages The clear KTK components must be securely exchanged between the partners and also loaded into the SCMs through a ‘secure key entry process’. They also must be securely stored e.g., in a safe. All these operational support requirements increase the operational cost of this method and security risks (of staff collusion, negligence, etc.). 4.6.5 KEK Component Method (a) This method is a ‘traditional’ method of the interchange key initialisation and as such is supported by older Security Control Module designs. It is still maintained by many interchange partners and in particular by many smaller organizations. (b) This method does not involve use of initial keys such as RSA or KTK but is based on direct manual storage of 3DES interchange keys in the SCM devices, therefore the interchange keys (KEKs) in this method are generated externally and are loaded into the device in components. The key material requires a secure key loading procedure and also secure storage of the key components. (c) This method is included for ‘backward compatibility’ and for a fall-back situation. (d) The key exchange procedure is the following: (i) the partners generate interchange keys in at least two XOR components and exchange paper components using a secure channel; (ii) the keys are loaded into the SCM device under dual control - the corresponding KVCs are noted for verification; the keys may also be encrypted under the KM for storage in the key data base; (iii) the partners confirm the KVCs; (iv) the paper components are stored in the secure storage (e.g., safes under dual control); (v) afterwards, the KEKs are ready for use. (e) Advantages This method is still in wide spread use across the industry. For this reason and because of its manual handling nature,

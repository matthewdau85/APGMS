Digital Partnership Office (DPO) The Digital Partnership Office (DPO) is the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO’s) dedicated team who collaborate with digital service providers (DSPs) to co-design digital solutions aimed at improving the tax, superannuation, and registry services for the community. We offer: Co-designing digital solutions: Collaborate closely with DSPs to design new and updated ATO services, ensuring seamless and effective digital solutions. Engagement and collaboration: Engage with DSPs early to understand industry demands and ensure that timeframes and impacts are considered when designing solutions. Information and resources: Offer detailed information about building and consuming ATO wholesale digital services, DSP requirements, upcoming engagements, consultation opportunities, and collaboration on projects. Share research and intelligence to facilitate informed decision-making. Integration Assistance: Help integrate ATO services into software products, enhancing the service offerings available for the community. Security: Provide guidance for DSPs to meet the requirements of the Operational Security Framework to ensure the security and integrity of the digital landscape and the data held within it. Please note, the DPO cannot assist with enquiries from your end users or provide any advice specific to your software. We recommend directing such enquiries to the relevant ATO area or advising users to visit the Contact us page on ato.gov.au to ensure their enquiry is directed appropriately.

How we're engaging with stakeholders AP+ is here to support the needs of payment users of all kinds, all across Australia. To make sure more of those users are represented in the work we do, we engage with a diverse range of stakeholders on topics that matter most to them. This includes our members, financial institutions, payment service providers, government, regulators, businesses and consumers. Our approach is designed to be inclusive and outcomes-focused, and may include methods such as public consultations, advisory forums, roundtable discussions, research, and ongoing dialogue. These engagements provide valuable insights, to help guide our decisions that shape our products, services and capabilities.

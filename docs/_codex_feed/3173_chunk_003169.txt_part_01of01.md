each of their customers? Always available or “always on” remote access is one of the three leading causes of merchant breaches (the other two are at Questions 7 and 8 above). Remote access provides a path from outside a merchant network into the merchant network, which a hacker can easily use to compromise your system (or hosted system) and gain access to cardholder data. This can include remote access into a merchant network, used by the vendor to support a payment terminal or application, or to support a third-party hosted merchant environment or web application. To protect yourself, you should make sure that vendors help you by: • Limiting remote access to brief periodic use • Disabling remote access when it is not being used • Using multi-factor authentication (a way of verifying the identity of a person accessing a system using two or more factors, such as something they know and something they do or are) • Using a different username and password for each customer the vendor accesses remotely (to prevent the use of a commonly-used username and password leading to a compromise of all their customers) Is the vendor PCI DSS compliant for the service they are offering me? 10. Is this solution or product run from systems owned and maintained (hosted) by the vendor? This means your vendor is a service provider. Ask: • Is the service provider’s environment PCI DSS compliant? • Does the service provider’s PCI DSS assessment cover the specific services the service provider is offering me? This is considered a “managed service.” Ask for the service provider’s PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance and check whether their assessment included the service you are using. Check to see if the service provider is on one of these lists: MasterCard’s List of Compliant Service Providers Visa’s Global Registry of Service Providers Visa Europe’s Registered Merchant Agents 11. Does the vendor’s agreement with me include clauses that state that the vendor will maintain PCI DSS compliance for their service (or become PCI DSS validated)? Vendors with services (also called service providers) that are or will become PCI DSS compliant should be willing to have that status included in a written agreement. Check to see if the service provider is on one of the lists included in Question 10 above. 8 Data Security Essentials for Small Merchants: Questions to Ask Your Vendors | August 2018 Copyright 2018 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved. Questions Ask: Analyzing Vendor Answers − Helpful Steps and Additional Information for Merchants Will the vendor provide support if there is a breach of my cardholder data? 12. If there is a data breach and vendor’s product/ solution is involved, ask: • What monitoring for data breaches and suspicious activities do you provide? • How and when do you notify me if there is a breach? • If I experience fines/penalties, do you offer support and protection? The vendor/service provider should provide support in the event of a cardholder data breach. The vendor/service provider should agree to cooperate with a forensics investigator if there are questions about the managed service or product/solution they provide. The vendor/service provider should agree to help you for fines incurred in the event there is a breach and it is determined that the vendor product/solution is the cause. 13. Does the vendor/service provider carry insurance to cover data breaches related to their product/solution? Having insurance illustrates the vendor/service provider has thought through their responsibility and liability related to cardholder data breaches. If they do carry insurance, ask about the scope of coverage and whether your implementation will be covered. 14. Does the vendor/service provider assist with notification of my customers in the event of a data breach when the vendor product/solution is the cause? Vendor/service provider should be willing to assist merchants with breach notification when their payment system is the cause of the breach. 15. If yes to question 14, to what degree do does the vendor assist with notification? Does the vendor: • Cover the cost? • Send the notifications? • Provide credit monitoring for the customers impacted? If the vendor does not assist with notification, you should develop a plan for notifying your customers in the event of a breach of cardholder data. 9 Data Security Essentials for Small Merchants: Questions to Ask Your Vendors | August 2018 Copyright 2018 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.

Document amended on September 2017 for the re-branding of APCA to AusPaynet September 2017 Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 3 AusPayNet September 2017 Introduction to This Version Amended, effective 19/05/08 Changes in this revision of the standard are predominantly in Section 6, Security. This reflects the industry’s continued attention to the prevention and detection of counterfeit and fraudulently altered cheques. The descriptions and content of the section covering security features has been updated to reflect current expert recommendations along with the section discussing ink coverage. Metric Measurements The majority of measurements given in this publication are derived from cheque printing equipment manufactured using imperial measurements. The necessary accuracy in conversion to metric measurement can often only be obtained with an unwieldy number of significant digits. Metric equivalents are thus given to the nearest millimetre. To enable the necessary accuracy to be retained, and to provide for a clear understanding of the measurement calculations (particularly in relation to tolerance specifications), the practice has been adopted of quoting all measurements in the base in which they were originally established. Metric alternatives to imperial measurements are invariably given in brackets; imperial alternatives to metric measurements, being unnecessary, generally are not.

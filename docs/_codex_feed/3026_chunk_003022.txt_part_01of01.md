trust by assuring continued protection of customer data and avoid compatibility challenges as older encryption algorithms weaken. 4.2.2 Certificate Transparency Certificate Transparency (CT) is a Google-initiated framework (defined at www.certificate- transparency.org) and is a new technique for further protecting the SSL/TLS ecosystem. At a high level, it requires CAs to submit information about each SSL/TLS certificate being issued to multiple CT log files. These log files can be viewed publicly, along with the domain name of the web server. The main advantage to CT is that an enterprise could monitor the CT log files and discover issuances of SSL/TLS certificates in its name that were not approved. For example, a company like Example Inc. might have a policy that “we only work with a particular CA, and any SSL/TLS certificate for https://*.example.com must be issued solely by that CA.” Example Inc. could then monitor the CT log files and learn that an SSL/TLS certificate for https://phishingserver.example.com was issued by a CA other than its approved CA, and take steps to have that SSL/TLS certificate revoked. A number of companies, in multiple sectors (banking and financial services, e-commerce, payment processing, content-delivery services, etc.) have expressed objections to the public availability of their web servers’ domain names being, and have chosen to opt out of using CT. If the company chooses to opt out, Google Chrome today makes the EV cert look like a non-EV cert (no green bar). A new CT spec is being reviewed and once it is approved and is deployed, customers who choose the “privacy feature” will be able to “redact” some portion of the fully qualified domain names in their CN and SubjectAltNames, but the domain name will still appear in the CT log file (so phishingserver.example.com will appear as example.com). 4.3 Merchant Questions on Certificate Types and TLS Migration Options This is an initial set of questions or concerns that a merchant might have, followed by some helpful guidance:  I am a small business so surely no one is going to attack me if I continue to use SSL and early TLS. Unfortunately, small businesses are just as susceptible to attack as larger organizations. Hackers use computer programs that systematically perform exhaustive searches for targets that are misconfigured or contain exploitable vulnerabilities. Hackers and their computers do not care how big or small an organization is that is utilizing a vulnerable system. We tend not to hear about small merchant Information Supplement • Best Practices for Securing E-commerce • April 2017 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 41 breaches because the businesses are not well known and the breaches too numerous. It is just a matter of time before any vulnerable system is exploited. The cost of a breach, even for a business storing a small number of credit cards, will far outweigh the cost it will take to migrate to TLS 1.2. For the small business that has outsourced all or part of its payment processing to a PCI DSS compliant SP, the service provider will mandate the migration to TLS 1.1 and/or TLS 1.2. The merchant will be required to adhere to the SP’s timeline for migration to ensure connection protocols for payment transactions continue to function.  My SP tells me that it supports later versions of TLS—is that all I need to do to meet the PCI DSS requirements on TLS? While support for the later versions of TLS (1.1 and 1.2) is good, the retention of support for the TLS 1.0 and any version of SSL still introduces a potential weakness in the environment unless appropriate compensating controls are implemented and maintained. In terms of PCI DSS compliance, then, SPs must support the use of later versions of TLS (currently 1.1 and 1.2) and must only support later versions of TLS for new implementations. Service providers can still offer SSL and TLS v1.0 up to 30 June 2018 for existing services, provided the SP has implemented appropriate risk-mitigation controls.  How can I find out what SSL/TLS protocols and versions I support? Although there are companies that provide testing services, one way of finding out whether your website supports a particular version of SSL or TLS is to use a computer browser to connect to the site and actually establish a secure connection. If you can connect using https, not http, and you can see the locked padlock, you have successfully established a secure connection. Note: Only TLS 1.1 or 1.2 connections are considered strong cryptography and supported secure encryption protocols. Each type of browser provides options that enable you to select specific versions of both SSL and TLS, so by a process of elimination you can quickly establish what is actually supported.  As a merchant, many of my customers, either because of policy or because of in-house systems incompatibility, do not have the latest software. Therefore, this may limit the versions of TLS that are available for them to implement. What can I do to be compliant without losing my customers? The best solution is to (1) develop a TLS mitigation plan to disable all early versions of TLS and migrate to TLS 1.2; (2) until the migration is complete, the merchant must address the vulnerabilities associated with the use of insecure protocols through risk-mitigating compensating controls.

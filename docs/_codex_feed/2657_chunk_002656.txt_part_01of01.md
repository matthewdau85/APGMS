different times to support teams across different time zones. Organizations could also consider using dedicated local resources or third-party translations services to support regional training needs.

Expanding on one or more of the topics in greater detail for each of the training sessions can differentiate the content, so that it does not become repetitive for staff. Incorporating training activities into existing activities, such as team meetings or safety training, can streamline training efforts. E-learning tools can provide an option for learners to take training at any time, helping to minimize the need for multiple staff to be available for training at the same time. Implementing robust methods to track training attendance for each type of delivery—for example, automated capture in e- learning courses and attendee lists from in-person training—can help the entity maintain accurate records. 8.5 Measuring Success The effectiveness of training will vary from context to context. Determining whether education and awareness initiatives have been successful is an important metric that can help with the development of future materials and methods. As a measure of success, the completion of training may be regarded as an important step where there no previously PCI DSS awareness training conducted, with subsequent re-tests used to determine whether key messaging has been retained by staff. Although determining how well training material can be recalled is one metric, using practical applications of training may produce more meaningful results. For example, training followed by social engineering tests or "secret shopper" tests, where the tester mimics a normal customer to see whether procedures match in the event of a security event, can provide a great degree of assurance that the intended controls work. After success criteria are defined, entities must determine what evidence will be collected to demonstrate success. Creating a baseline for PCI DSS educational knowledge can help provide a benchmark for measuring success. Building success criteria should be included in the training development stage. Additionally, the baseline for measuring success should be reviewed and updated at regular intervals or in response to particular events to ensure it remains effective. For example, results of security incident investigations, incident response tests, and security testing activities could identify the need for updates to the training program or content.

Often, the number of networks, systems, and devices to track and secure is overwhelming. Keeping up with and managing the various systems is a complex and demanding job that should be addressed in a systematic and well-organized manner. 9.1 Asset Management Correct identification and tracking of networks, systems, or devices in the organization’s environment is fundamental to good security. While good asset management is a fundamental principle in IT security, it can be challenging for large populations of systems, system groups under different ownership, or environments subject to frequent change. Large organizations should prioritize the creation of asset-management strategies that not only detect networks and systems in use, but identify the assets based on characteristics such as hostname, IP address, operating system, firmware type and version, location, function, etc. This process should identify and track physical and virtual networks, servers, workstations, hypervisors or other virtualization components, networking devices, appliances, HSMs and other cryptographic devices, POIs, and any other relevant components. Having a robust asset management process minimizes the risk that organizations will lose track of systems and software in the network. Having full awareness of assets can reduce the chances of critical vulnerabilities remaining unaddressed in the cardholder data environment. Organizations with an incomplete inventory should prioritize a project to identify and classify all systems in existing environments as soon as possible. To account for and track the status of assets in a large complex architecture, entities should investigate the use of automated asset-management technologies. Features to look for in an asset-management tool include:  Automated device scanning  Device categorization  Installed OS and software detection  License tracking  Update or patch status  Installation date  Location At a minimum, a detailed spreadsheet could be used, although the maintenance of a manual list will likely be impractical. There are many commercial and open-source asset management software tools that could be considered. If distinct groups within an organization manage different populations of systems or asset management tools, a standardized format for the inventory and schedule for publishing updates should be established across the entire organization. PCI DSS offers guidance about selecting each type or combination and function to ensure that the assessor is confident that the sample represents the whole. The best way to achieve this with the fewest number of samples is through automation and standardization, where systems have

Printer friendly version (PDF 0.3MB) Video help guide (YouTube) Explanatory statements explain what a legislative instrument does using plain or non-legal language. They can be used as additional information to help understand and interpret an instrument. Explanatory statements were first prepared for Commonwealth regulations in about 1932 but those prepared before 1982 are generally not publicly accessible. In some cases, copies of pre-1982 explanatory statements may be available by request through departmental archives or the records of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation – Parliament of Australia. Federal Register of Legislation Most explanatory statements that were prepared from 1991 onwards are available on the Federal Register of Legislation alongside their Commonwealth legislative instrument.

Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation – Parliament of Australia The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation assesses legislative instruments against a set of scrutiny principles that focus on compliance with statutory requirements, the protection of individual rights and liberties, and principles of parliamentary oversight. One of these principles is to make an assessment as to whether an explanatory statement that accompanies an instrument provides sufficient information to provide a clear understanding of the instrument. For information about the committee’s work or information on legislation that has been assessed against the scrutiny principles see Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation – Parliament of Australia.

the topic later in the year. Another priority outlined in the Strategic Plan was action on scams. Pleasingly, there has been real progress here, with the National Anti-Scam Centre (NASC) having launched on 1 July and immediately announced its first fusion cell, targeting investment scams. I am representing AusPayNet on the NASC’s Advisory Board. Finally, on cybersecurity, the Plan noted the need for an “uplift in system-wide security standards and practices relating to the security standards and encryption methods for card payment systems” and that, given this, “AusPayNet has commenced planning for an industry-wide program to migrate the Australian card payments system to the safer Advanced Encryption Standard” . This program is now in its mobilisation phase, which will continue until December 2024. This phase includes the preparatory activities to finalise the technical blueprint, testing strategy, and migration approach. top Update on payments reforms AusPayNet continues to engage with Government stakeholders, regulators and departments on the following consultations: Responses to the Consultations on Payment System Reforms As outlined in CEO’s Corner, AusPayNet submitted responses to two consultation papers underpinning part of the Government’s payment system reform agenda: Reforms to the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998 (PSRA) and Payments System Modernisation (Licensing: Defining Payment Functions ). We look forward to continuing our engagement with Treasury and Members on the payment system reforms, including through the upcoming consultation on the regulatory obligations that would apply under the new PSP licensing framework. Response to the Consultation on Modernising Australia’s AML/CTF Regime In June, AusPayNet responded to the Attorney-General’s Department’s consultation on modernising Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) regime . The AML/CTF regime is a critical part of Australia’s efforts to prevent criminals from receiving the proceeds of their illegal activity and stopping funds from falling into the hands of terrorist organisations. As observed in the consultation paper, the regime has not kept pace with the changing threat environment and evolving international standards, resulting in gaps and vulnerabilities that could have significant economic and social consequences for Australia. In line with AusPayNet’s commitment to working with Members, government and other stakeholders to defend the payments system from economic crime, our submission welcomed the review of the AML/CTF regime to ensure that it remains clear, fit-for-purpose and meets international standards and best practice. We expressed support for: Simplifying and modernising the AML/CTF regime to help businesses better understand and comply with their obligations, and promote consistency in application across entities Amending the tipping-off offence to enable greater collaboration between financial crime teams across the ecosystem, to facilitate the detection and disruption of economic crime Expanding the AML/CTF obligations to digital currency exchanges and tranche-two entities, in line with the international Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Standards Updating and simplifying the customer due diligence obligations, including to reflect developments in identification technology and processes Ensuring that any changes to the travel rule obligations account for the data limitations of Australia’s direct entry system, to ensure that BECS can continue to support the settlement of the significant share of Australia’s payment transactions that it does currently. Response to the Consultation on Safe and Responsible AI in Australia In August, AusPayNet responded to Government’s consultation on supporting responsible artificial intelligence (AI) in Australia . AI has the potential to deliver significant benefits across all areas of Australia’s economy and society. The payments ecosystem has been using AI technology for several years to drive innovation, efficiency and safety for businesses and consumers. However, the ongoing developments in AI also have the potential to generate significant risks if not designed and deployed responsibly. This can deter adoption and limit Australia’s opportunity to capture the full benefits of this technology. AusPayNet supports the Government’s work to ensure that Australia has clear and proportionate governance frameworks in place to mitigate potential risks while supporting the continued development and adoption of effective and trustworthy AI technology. Based on our review of global approaches to AI regulation and our experience in developing and managing standards for the payments industry, we propose adopting a sector-based approach in which regulators would seek to proportionately address the risks posed by AI within their respective remits, in accordance with existing laws and regulations and guided by a set of cross-sectoral principles on responsible AI. This would give regulators the flexibility to tailor their response to the use and impact of AI for specific contexts within their areas of expertise, while ensuring general consistency in outcomes across the economy. Given the cross-border nature of technology, global coordination on governance will also be important for facilitating the development and adoption of AI technologies. We also encourage the Government to consider measures that would assist businesses in adopting AI technology, including the provision of tools to help verify that an AI-enabled system meets the necessary standards. top Economic Crime Forum (ECF) update As we have noted before, we stand at a generational tipping point in payments, with two once-in-a-lifetime opportunities: to modernise payments regulation to simplify the payments system. However, alongside these generational opportunities, we have one generational obligation: to mitigate scams, which unfortunately affect far too many Australian consumers and businesses. AusPayNet is a member of the National Anti-Scam Centre (NASC) Advisory Board and the NASC’s investment scam fusion cell. To support the NASC and ACCC, we continue to leverage our Economic Crime Forum (ECF). In August, the ECF met in Canberra and discussed appropriate friction in payments and initiatives

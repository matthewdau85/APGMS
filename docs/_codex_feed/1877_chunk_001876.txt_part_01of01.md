New Payments Platform Australia (NPPA) Board has appointed Bob McKinnon as the company’s new independent Chair. His appointment is the result of an extensive search process following Paul Lahiff’s decision last year to step down after five years’ service. Mr McKinnon brings to the role considerable experience from a 40-year career, which has seen him build a highly respected portfolio of Board appointments. This portfolio spans a broad spectrum of industries including financial services, technology, wealth management, property, civil engineering and the not-for-profit sector. CEO of NPP Australia, Adrian Lovney, said it was Mr McKinnon’s multifaceted career that led the NPPAL Board to determine him a stand-out candidate. “Bob’s extensive leadership skills have been garnered from a highly respected career in multiple senior executive roles of major ASX listed companies including CIO of both Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. He has held c-suite roles in organisations including Brookfield Multiplex, State Street Australia and Lendlease. “Bob has also founded and held board positions in organisations focused on developing and delivering disruptive innovation in the financial services sector, including the Invigor Group, Blue Chilli Technology and the Mirin Group. His experience and insight will be a valuable addition to our Board,” Mr Lovney said. Mr Lovney also paid tribute to previous Chair Paul Lahiff and independent director Chloe Munro AO. “NPP Australia’s Board is extremely grateful for Paul Lahiff’s outstanding service as Chair. Without doubt, his leadership was vital to bringing the NPP to life. The industry collaboration required to build and launch the NPP is rarely seen in our industry and Paul’s leadership was instrumental in making it happen,” Mr Lovney said. “The Board would also like to thank Chloe Munro for acting as NPPAL Chair, allowing us adequate time for the extensive market search required to fill the position.”

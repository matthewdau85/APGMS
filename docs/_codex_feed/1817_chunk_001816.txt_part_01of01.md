Confirmation of Payee is an industry-wide service that adds a layer of protection for payments to a BSB and account number. It checks the account name, BSB and account number you’ve entered against the details held by the recipient’s bank and lets you know whether it’s a match. This can help you make informed decisions before you make a payment, reducing the risk of scams and mistaken payments. Confirmation of Payee is an initiative of Australian Payments Plus, the same organisation that also provides trusted payment services like BPAY, Osko, eftpos, PayID and PayTo.

DSS Requirement 6.4.5) Upon initial implementation of a particular control, implementation measures will likely be less than 100%. As security controls mature and results begin to approach 100%, the compliance manager may conclude that systems have fully implemented the security controls addressed by this metric. At that point, any change to the measure (i.e., less than 100%) can be used as a trigger to indicate a failure in security controls. 3.3.1.2 Efficiency and Effectiveness Measures Efficiency and effectiveness measures are used to determine whether systematic program- level and individual security controls are designed and implemented correctly, operating as intended, and meeting the desired outcome. Control efficiency is a qualitative evaluation of a control environment or individual control to fully address the risk, including control complexity, segregation of duties, and the knowledge and competency of the personnel operating the control. Operating effectiveness, by contrast, evaluates and measures whether the control is consistent, complete, reliable, and operated in a timely manner. These measures concentrate on the evidence and results of assessments and may require multiple data points qualifying or quantifying the degree to which controls are implemented and the effect(s) on the organization’s security posture. Risk mitigation is also a key metric for determining the overall impact of an organization’s information security program to its business objectives. When evaluating the operating effectiveness of the vulnerability-management program, an organization could measure: ▪ Completeness: - The frequency that a full inventory scan of all network assets (workstations, servers, routers, switches, access points, etc.) is run and the variability of the asset inventory over time (PCI DSS Requirement 2.4) ▪ Consistency: - Percentage of all software (including firmware) identified in the inventory that is regularly evaluated for vulnerabilities and associated risk using a consistent risk ranking (e.g., CVSS) based on vendor and industry notification (PCI DSS Requirement 6.1) - Percentage of system, application, and other changes that are scanned (or fail to be scanned) for vulnerabilities and patched prior to release into production (PCI DSS Requirements A3.2.2.1, 6.4) - Percentage of known vulnerabilities for which patches have been applied or otherwise mitigated (PCI DSS Requirement 6.2) Information Supplement • Best Practices for Maintaining PCI DSS Compliance • January 2019 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information.

These measures are inherently organization-specific. Impact measures can quantify the return on security investment produced by the information security program, the degree of public trust gained and/or maintained by the information security program, and other mission-related impacts on information security. However, there are other valuable impact measures that may be useful in gauging security-program impact. Examples include: ▪ Percentage of an organization’s IT budget devoted to information security ▪ Percentage of an organization’s customers satisfied by the organization’s commitment to data protection ▪ Return on security investments (ROSI) ▪ Total cost of ownership (TCO) 3.3.2 Metric Reliability While the establishment and collection of metrics is a key function of determining the capabilities and effectiveness of an organization’s security program, metrics are reliable only when the collection mechanisms or controls on which they depend are implemented correctly. Collecting metrics from poorly implemented security controls is equivalent to using a “broken or uncalibrated scale.”7 The interpretation of metrics data presumes that the controls directly or indirectly used in the metric calculation are implemented and working as expected. For example, if data output from file-integrity monitoring mechanisms (specified in PCI DSS Requirement 11.5) is used to monitor and evaluate change management controls (such as PCI DSS Requirements 1.1.1 and 6.4), the metrics data collected is dependent on the proper implementation of the file-integrity monitoring mechanisms. Without the proper implementation and ongoing management of those security controls from which metrics data is collected, it may be difficult or impossible to determine the root cause of any system or security control failures that may have occurred. 7 Kelley Dempsey, Nirali Shah Chawla, Arnold Johnson, Ronald Johnston, Alicia Clay Jones, Angela Orebaugh, Matthew Scholl, and Kevin Stine, NIST Special Publication 800-137: Information Security Continuous Monitoring for Federal Information Systems and Organizations (NIST, 2011).

Ongoing compliance benefits from centralized coordination of numerous technologies, processes, and people. An individual responsible for compliance (a Compliance Manager) should be: ▪ Assigned overall responsibility for these activities, ▪ Qualified to perform such functions⎯e.g., have knowledge and experience managing compliance programs, ▪ Knowledgeable in the organization’s business structure and payment processes, ▪ Given adequate funding and resources (e.g., tools, education, budget, etc.), and ▪ Granted the proper authority to effectively organize and allocate such resources. Note: Compliance Managers might also benefit from industry certifications⎯for example, those

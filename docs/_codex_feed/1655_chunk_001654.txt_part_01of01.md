e-Conveyancing Electronic conveyancing or e-conveyancing is the transfer of interests in land (for example, property ownership) and the completion of associated payments using a digital platform referred to as an Electronic Lodgment Network (ELN). e-Conveyancing is currently mandatory in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. It is available for certain transactions in Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania, and plans are in place for it to be available in the Northern Territory. Industry Code Following a request from the Council of Financial Regulators, AusPayNet developed, with the support of the e-conveyancing industry, the e-Conveyancing Payments Industry Code (Industry Code) in 2023. The Industry Code establishes a framework for regulation of the payment aspects of e-conveyancing transactions between Electronic Lodgement Network Operators (ELNOs) and financial institutions. The Industry Code: requires compliance with various security related obligations; provides standardisation of relevant parts of the payment process; establishes a process between Code Participants for managing mistaken or incomplete payments; and will first apply to single-ELNO eConveyancing transactions, and later to multiple ELNO transactions, when interoperability is implemented. Industry Code membership In late February 2025, ARNECC (Australian Registrars’ National Electronic Conveyancing Council) announced that ELNOs will be required to obtain and maintain membership of the Industry Code. Once ELNOs are Industry Code members, financial institutions that want to participate directly with ELNOs will be required to become members as well. AusPayNet has now opened the Industry Code for membership following consultation with ARNECC and other significant stakeholders. Membership is now open Contact us to learn more about applying for membership of the Industry Code. This will include requesting your guide to membership and application form. Contact Us AusPayNet membership Industry Code members are also required to be Members of AusPayNet. If any Industry Code applicant is not an existing member of AusPayNet, they can apply simultaneously to join. The e-Conveyancing Payments Industry Code (eC1) Guide to Membership addresses applications for AusPayNet membership and selection of membership class.

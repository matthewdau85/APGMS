scenarios. • If your SSP is transporting the message and you are undertaking all schema and validation rule checking, you will need to ensure a greater range of testing is demonstrated. Technical Support If issues are identified in PAYEVNT messages sent to the ATO from the SSPs Sender Auskey the: • ATO will work with the SSP and DSP to identify the issues and assist with resolution. • owner of the product ID or the reporting party (employer) included in the PAYEVNT message will be contacted where the business content may not be considered compliant or if they are responsible for schema and validation rule implementation. SSPs will need to manage and ensure all message responses are pulled and forwarded on to their customers. Frequently Asked Questions # Question Answer 1 Who is the software provider sending the request when a SSP is involved? The payroll software provider. Their product ID will be supplied to the ATO which will be used to determine what software is being used to generate STP reports. 2 Can an Online (Cloud) service provider (DSPs using ATO Cloud Authentication and Authorisation) use a SSP to send the message to the ATO? No, a SSP cannot act on behalf of an ATO approved OSP. Where the business model requires a Cloud authentication and authorisation (CAA) solution, the SSP will be required to undergo that approval process. 3 Can a PAYEVNT message be lodged for a WPN only employer where there is no registered agent involved? Yes, WPN holders can lodge via a SSP without needing to use a registered agent. Note that PAYEVNT.0002 2017 will not be updated to support this. 4 What conformance suite testing must a DSP complete to get their product whitelisted? The PAYEVNT Conformance suite has been designed to cover a range of situations a DSPs product must be capable of handling. This DSP Guide Using a SSP to meet STP reporting obligations OFFICIAL EXTERNAL 10 includes all types of error responses, excluding authorisation errors. Your solution must be capable of handling the following error responses from (whether returned directly to them through an API or indirectly via another means): • Invalid schema • Validation rules. • A partial file rejection (2018 version only) • Parent record rejecting only • Child record/s rejecting only. Depending on your solution, not all conformance suite scenarios will need to be completed, however you will need to work with your SSP to ensure all tests required are completed. It is expected that a SSP will assist a DSP (if they are using a SSP) in addressing ebMS3 standard errors such as message not available for pulling, authorisation and system outages.

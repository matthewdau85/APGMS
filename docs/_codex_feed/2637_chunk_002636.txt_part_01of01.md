been restored and the cause of the failure identified, it may be necessary to increase the monitoring frequency of the control to ensure the control is working as expected. Once the organization is satisfied that the control is operating correctly and no other issues with the control exist, standard monitoring frequencies may be resumed. 3.8 Maintain Security Awareness Data breaches are not limited to the exploitation of technical vulnerabilities⎯they are trending to also involve the use of social-engineering techniques. In such cases, an entity’s employees are lured into executing actions that allow threat actors to both deploy tools that will permit the exploitation of an existing vulnerability, as well as to create a new vulnerability to achieve exfiltration of critical data⎯in this specific case, cardholder data. While investing in security monitoring and access-management tools allow the entity to reduce their risk profile, these tools do not guarantee that risk can be reduced to immaterial levels. No security tool can provide such a level of risk reduction.

PCI DSS Requirement 12.6 provides specifics around the need of implementing a security awareness program, defining communication methods, providing such training upon hire and at last annually, and implementing effective communication channels for security awareness. The foundation of any mature security awareness program starts by developing adequate policies and procedures that define the different levels and content of awareness training to be provided to the different employees involved in the handling of cardholder data, including those who can incidentally come in contact with such data. It is also important to implement a formal security awareness process with defined roles and responsibilities to maintain periodic campaigns that will be updated based on the trends and vectors identified in published data breaches. Constantly updating the security awareness programs allow entities to not only keep their workforce up to speed with the latest trends in breaches, but also avoid the fatigue that comes with repetitive awareness-campaign content that can result in employees ignoring the message. 3.9 Monitoring Compliance of Third-Party Service Providers Often, third-party service providers (TPSP) are responsible for the implementation and maintenance of security controls required to meet PCI DSS. It is critical that entities and their TPSPs have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities for maintaining compliance with applicable PCI DSS requirements (see Appendix C: Applicability of PCI DSS Requirements to Assets Type,” for further guidance). Monitoring of TPSP compliance status is an integral component in maintaining compliance that allows the entity to determine whether a change in status requires a change in the relationship. Moreover, as reported in several major breach studies17 18 19, breaches of TPSPs are a common target as an entry point to an entity’s valuable data. The PCI Security Standards Council has published the Information Supplement: Third-Party Security Assurance, which provides further guidance on implementing third-party assurance program.20 17 Beazley Group, “Beazley breach insights – July 2017” (Beazley Group, 2017), https://www.beazley.com/news/2017/beazley_breach_insights_july_2017.html 18 Cisco, “Cisco 2018 Annual Cybersecurity Report” (Cisco, 2018), https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_au/products/security/offers/annual-cybersecurity-report-2018.html 19 https://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_DBIR_2018_Report_execsummary_en_xg.pdf 20 Third-Party Security Assurance and Shared Responsibilities Special Interest Groups and PCI Security Standards Council, Third-Party Security Assurance (PCI SSC, March 2016), https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/ThirdPartySecurityAssurance_March2016_FINAL.pdf.

Examples of relevant PCI SSC information resources include publication of new and updated standards, FAQs, guidance documents, blog posts, and other information that clarifies or introduces additional requirements. Communication efforts should include but not be limited to internal e-mail notifications, scheduled conference calls and meetings with personnel involved in maintaining PCI DSS compliance, internal publications such as bulletins and blog posts, updates to supporting and program documentation, executive management reports, etc. Such communications should include a full description of the changes or threats, identification of the impacted business processes and facilities, and any resultant impact to the organization’s PCI DSS compliance efforts. All impacted training and awareness materials should also be updated accordingly. 3.10.2 Organizational Changes Changes in an organization’s overall management and operational structure can alter the organization’s risk profile as well as the scope of their PCI DSS compliance efforts. For example, a merger, acquisition, or introduction of a new business line may introduce new payment channels that need to be considered. Similarly, when the organization insources or outsources operational processes, responsibility may shift for certain aspects of PCI DSS compliance activities (e.g., to a new internal team) that need to be understood and accounted for. Failure to determine how such changes impact the organization’s risk environment and PCI DSS scope could leave key business functions vulnerable to compromise or non-compliance. Other types of organizational changes that warrant consideration can include internal restructuring, corporate spin-offs, bankruptcies and liquidations, and loss of key IT

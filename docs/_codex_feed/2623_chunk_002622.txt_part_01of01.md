Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 4 1 Introduction Since the inception of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), compliance with PCI DSS has steadily increased among organizations that store, process, and transmit cardholder data. The increase in PCI DSS compliance rates can likely be attributed to increased awareness of the standard, evolutions in card brand compliance programs and mandates, and an overall increase in the maturity of PCI DSS. However, despite these improvements, statistics show that most of these organizations still have yet to master ongoing PCI DSS compliance. 1 If organizations want to protect themselves and their customers from potential losses or damages resulting from a data breach, they must strive for ways to maintain a continuous state of compliance throughout the year rather than simply seeking point-in-time validation. A study conducted by Verizon from 2011 to 2017,2 on organizations that had a data breach, showed that many of the organizations that were assessed as being non-compliant at the time of their breach had successfully complied during their previous PCI DSS assessment and had lapsed into non-compliance. Through a combination of people, processes, and technology, organizations must incorporate continuous security and compliance practices into their culture and daily operational activities. The objective of this document is to provide guidance on best practices for maintaining ongoing compliance with PCI DSS. The focus is to provide organizations with recommendations to plan for continuous compliance as opposed to a point-in-time, annual assessment approach. The information in this document is intended as supplemental guidance and does not supersede, replace, or extend requirements in any PCI SSC standards, nor does it endorse the use of any specific technologies, products, or services. While all references made in this document are to PCI DSS version 3.2.1, the general principles and practices offered here may be applied beyond the context of PCI DSS. 1.1 Intended Audience This guidance is intended for organizations seeking to better understand how to maintain compliance with PCI DSS. Examples include merchants, service providers, acquirers (merchant banks), and issuers. This guidance assumes readers are familiar with the PCI DSS requirements, testing procedures, and scoping guidance, and possess a basic understanding of computer information systems, networking technologies, and general IT principles and terminology. 1.2 Terminology Please refer to the PCI DSS Glossary, Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms3 for terms and definitions that are used throughout this document. 1 Ciske van Oosten, Sky Hackett, and Anne Turner, Verizon 2017 Payment Security Report (Verizon, 2017).

PCI SSC. Each PCIP will receive an electronic certificate that is suitable for printing and framing. PCIP qualifications are issued for a three-year period, effective on the date that the examination was passed (or for Eligible QSA and ISA Individuals, effective as of the date the PCIP credential is issued by PCI SSC). No qualification shall be valid if obtained or renewed through fraud or the submission of inaccurate qualification data. The qualification will remain valid as long as the holder meets PCI SSC’s maintenance requirements for PCIPs and complies with the PCI SSC Code of Professional Responsibility.

of registration of multiple sites). The Printer Identifier is to be quoted by the recognised security printer when requesting design approval and/or printing approval from the customer’s or other relevant Financial Institution.

Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 10 AusPayNet September 2017 1.3.2 Financial Institution’s Approval Procedures for Printing Amended, effective 02/2001 Before production commences the printer must obtain DAN, PAN and a Confirmatory Authority from the customer’s or other relevant Financial Institution. Depending on the circumstances, a printer may submit a request for approval of a base design from any Financial Institution prior to submitting requests for printing approval from the customer’s Financial Institution. Alternatively, both requests may be submitted to the customer’s Financial Institution together. Once a request for design and/or printing approval has arrived at the designated point of the relevant Financial Institution, refer Appendix F, the request for approval must be actioned within three days. Approval to print, once issued by the relevant Financial Institution, is valid for three months from the date of issue of the Confirmatory Authority. Should the ordered documents not be printed in that time, the printer is to submit a further request to the Financial Institution for re- approval. The approval processes and related flow charts in Appendix E describe the four-standard approval/authorisation scenarios that have been developed. These are: 1. Approval of new design with MICR 2. Base design approval 3. New document with approved base design 4. Reprint with no changes. Also in Appendix E are the requirements for design approval and allocation of a DAN as well as the requirements for the allocation of a PAN and the issue of a Confirmatory Authority. 1.3.3 Evaluation Section 1.3.3 has been extensively revised, effective 12/1999 The printer is to supply to the Financial Institution that issued the PAN, samples taken from the actual print run for evaluation at the rate specified in Section 7.2 of this Publication. Refer also Appendix E. The Financial Institution is to evaluate the samples for conformance to the standards for:  MICR  Colour  Security  Design  Paper as set out in this Publication and AusPayNet Publication Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Technical Specifications. Amended, effective 19/05/08 The results of the evaluation must be advised to the printer in writing, by fax or electronic mail. 1.3.3.1 Print Orders for 20,000 Forms or Less For print orders of 20,000 forms or less, the printer may release the forms on completion as directed on the Confirmatory Authority, without waiting for the results of the MICR evaluation by the Financial Institution. Design Specifications for Cheques and Deposit Forms Version 11.5.5 P a g e | 11 AusPayNet September 2017 The Financial Institution must complete the evaluation and advise the results to the printer within five business days of despatch of the sample by the printer. If non-compliance with this publication or the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Technical Specifications is discovered during the evaluation, the printer is responsible for recalling the incorrectly printed forms. Amended, effective 19/05/08 The cost of re-printing, should it be necessary, is to be borne by the errant party. The printer will be required to provide, if applicable, a Certificate of Destruction within two weeks to the Financial Institution to confirm that all non-complying forms have been recalled, and destroyed. Where the total volume ordered for successive prints for the same account exceeds 20,000 forms in total over a period of three months, each order is to be treated for evaluation purposes as if it is for an order of greater than 20,000, see Section 1.3.3.2 1.3.3.2 Print Orders for Greater Than 20,000 Forms Revised For print orders of greater than 20,000 forms, the printer must not release the forms until the result of the evaluation is received or a period of five business days has elapsed from the date the samples were despatched to the Financial Institution. In the case of a failed evaluation and where the Financial Institution has not notified the printer within five business days, it is the responsibility of the Financial Institution to liaise with its customer to rectify the situation. The cost of re-printing, should it be necessary, is to be borne by the errant party. The printer will be required to provide, if applicable, a Certificate of Destruction within two weeks to the Financial Institution to confirm that all non-complying forms have been recalled, and destroyed. For partial print runs of 20,000 forms or less, from an order of over 20,000, each print run is to be treated for evaluation purposes as if it is for an order of greater than 20,000. 1.4 Document Sizes The maximum and minimum dimensions (excluding butts and/or other attachments) for all documents, except Transfer Credit Forms (see Section 3.3), must be in accordance with Figure 1.

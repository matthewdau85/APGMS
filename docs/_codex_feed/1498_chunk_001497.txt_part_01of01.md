respond, and recover. These functions support an organisation in expressing a level of cyber security risk by addressing threats and developing learnings. NIST is to be completed via a maturity assessment and can only be applied to Category B (medium to high-risk APIs) and Category C (low to no risk APIs) DSPs. Evidence required Documentation demonstrating compliance to one of the approved security standards must include notes on how controls are applied in your organisation and if applicable, why certain controls may not be applied. Data hosting DSPs must provide details of their hosting provider to us. This requirement seeks to limit the risk of access to Taxation, Accounting, Payroll, Business Registry or Superannuation related information by individuals with no authority, including foreign actors. By default, a DSP should host data onshore. Offshore hosting arrangements will be managed by exception on a case-by-case basis. Where a DSP is planning to host data offshore, additional evidence will be required to satisfy the data hosting requirement. If you have a compelling reason for storing data outside Australia, you must consult us to ensure the impacts are adequately addressed. As part of this consultation, you must demonstrate that you have considered the jurisdictional constraints. Our preference is for all redundancy locations to mirror the primary production environment. Where strong encryption controls and alignment to APRA Prudential Practice Guide CPG 235 Managing Data Risk (PDF, 328.44KB) and APRA Prudential Practice Guide SPG 231 Outsourcing (PDF, 249.51KB) are applied you can discuss the suitability of redundancy hosting arrangements in an offshore location with us. Applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Consistent with APRA Prudential Practice Guide CPG 235 Managing Data Risk , we expect the following to be applied to the assessment and ongoing management of offshore data hosting: enterprise frameworks such as security, project management, system development, outsourcing/offshoring management and risk management a detailed risk assessment a detailed understanding of the extent and nature of the business processes and the sensitivity/criticality of the data impacted by the arrangement a business case justifying the additional risk exposures. Consistent with APRA Prudential Practice Guide SPG 231 Outsourcing (PDF, 249.51KB) , we expect you to complete a risk assessment against the following risks, including details of the steps you will take to mitigate them: Country: risk that overseas economic, political and/or social events will have an impact on the ability of an overseas service provider to continue to provide an outsourced service to you as the DSP. Compliance (legal): risk that offshoring arrangements will have an impact on your ability to comply with relevant Australian and foreign laws and regulations (including accounting practices). Contractual : risk that your ability as a DSP to enforce the offshoring agreement may be limited or completely negated. Access : risk that your ability as a DSP to obtain information and to retain records is partly or completely hindered. This risk also refers to the potential difficulties or inability of the ATO to gain access to information using our information gathering powers. Counterparty : risk arising from the counterparty’s failure to meet the terms of agreement with you as a DSP or to otherwise perform as agreed. We expect that an offshoring arrangement would typically include a provision around security and confidentiality of information. If you are storing data outside Australia, you must: make it clear to customers that their data is being stored in a foreign jurisdiction apply the Australian Privacy Principles provide guidelines to your customers around where and how their data is being managed. Evidence required Provider name Provider location (region) Redundancy location (region) Provider certification (ASD or another security standard). If you are storing data offshore you will need to contact the DPO. Encryption key management DSPs need to demonstrate a policy or process is in place to govern the lifecycle management of encryption keys and minimise the risks of compromised keys. The scope of this policy should cover three categories: Asymmetric/public key algorithms Hashing algorithms and Symmetric encryption algorithms. The use of algorithms must align to the Australian Government Guidelines for using cryptography . A key management policy or plan must include generation, distribution, storage, renewal, revocation, recovery, archiving and destruction of encryption keys. For more information see attachment F in APRA Information Security CPS 234 (PDF, 837KB) . Evidence required Copy of your key management policy or plan which includes: Generation Distribution Storage Access Renewal Revocation Rotation Archiving Length and complexity of keys Destruction of compromised encryption keys Recovery Encryption at rest The scope of encryption at rest covers data stored for the purpose of Taxation, Accounting, Payroll, Business Registry and Superannuation transactions including Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The approved symmetric encryption algorithms are Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) using key lengths of 128, 192 and 256 bits, and Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) and three distinct keys as per the Australian Government Guidelines for using cryptography . DSPs can choose to apply this control by either encrypting the disk, container, application, or database. Alternatively, you may choose to apply partial encryption to data at the block, field, or column level but this must cover data that is stored for the purpose of Taxation, Accounting, Payroll, Business Registry and Superannuation transactions including Personally Identifiable Information (PII). If you have implemented encryption at rest, further controls are recommended.

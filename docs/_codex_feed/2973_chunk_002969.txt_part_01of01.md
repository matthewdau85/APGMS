PCI Security Standards Council, Penetration Testing Guidance, (PCI SSC, September 2017), https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1.pdf. Information Supplement • Cloud Computing Guidelines • April 2018 The intent of this document is to provide supplemental information. Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 23 Scenario Environment Description PCI DSS Scoping Guidance Case 3: Third-party Provider hosting a PCI DSS compliant public cloud supporting multiple Customers, with validated segmentation for Customer environments • VMs may be on one or multiple hypervisors; all hypervisors and VMs are configured by Provider to support PCI DSS requirements. • Multiple Customers are hosted on each hypervisor. • One or more containers running within one or more dedicated container orchestration servers • Validated segmentation of Customer environments using a combination of physical and logical controls The Provider is responsible for compliance of all elements of each underlying PCI DSS compliant cloud service provided to the Customer. Each Customer’s scope would include its own environment (e.g., VMs, applications, etc.), the user and system configuration and management of the Provider services (Customers' access controls, etc.), and any other elements not managed by the Provider. Segmentation must be validated as providing effective isolation between Customers as part of the Provider’s validation and may require additional validation as part of each Customer’s validation. Case 4: Third-party Provider hosting a PCI DSS compliant public cloud supporting multiple Customers, no Customer segmentation • VMs may be on one or multiple hypervisors; all hypervisors configured by Provider to support PCI DSS requirements. • Multiple Customers are hosted on each hypervisor, VM configuration managed by each Customer. • Customers may be running isolated containers that may be in orchestration servers. • Segmentation between Customer environments is not verified. All systems are in scope. This is not an environment likely to be compliant given that the entire cloud service and all Customer environments are in scope. Note that validating PCI DSS compliance may be intractable and infeasible, as every Customer environment would need to be included in the assessment (including Customer applications and software). Penetration testing would need to be conducted for all Customer environments as well. Due to regulatory and confidentiality requirements, individual cloud Customers will rarely be granted contractual audit rights to complete a PCI DSS assessment that includes other Customers.

Information provided here does not replace or supersede requirements in any PCI SSC Standard. 24 Scenario Environment Description PCI DSS Scoping Guidance Case 5: Hybrid cloud – Customer is utilizing a third-party Provider that hosts a PCI DSS compliant public cloud supporting multiple Customers, but also has connectivity with a mix of third-party hosted or internally hosted private cloud or on-premises Customer-hosted environment that utilizes services and direct connectivity between these different platforms/environments. • VMs may be on one or multiple hypervisors. Hypervisors are likely to be configured by Provider to support PCI DSS requirements and may have Customer-managed hypervisors if connectivity exists to Customer on-premises environment. • Multiple Customers hosted on each hypervisor of Provider. Customer Private Cloud or on- premises environment would be dedicated to Customer. • One or more containers running within one or more dedicated container orchestration servers • Providers may provide services utilized for connectivity of the mixed platform environment that should be included as part of their annual validation. Scoping Guidance for Provider The Provider is responsible for compliance of all elements of the cloud service it provides. Each Customer’s scope would include its own environment (e.g., VMs, applications, services, etc.) and any other elements not managed by the Provider. If Provider provides the services allowing connectivity between the mixed environments, then this solution and Provider-managed equipment and service should be validated by the Provider. Alternatively, if for example the Provider enables services (either physical or virtual) to be configured and managed by the Customer, enabling connectivity between mixed environments, then the Customer scope would include all Customer- managed configurations, while the underlying infrastructure would be validated by the Provider. Segmentation controls utilized within the Provider- provided cloud must be validated as providing effective isolation between Customers as part of the Provider’s validation. Scoping Guidance for Customer Customer is responsible for ensuring that solutions and services provided by its Provider for connectivity have been validated as compliant. Customer would be responsible for compliance of all elements it configures and manages within the Provider environment and any on-premises or private cloud connected to the CDE. Customer is responsible for ensuring that any connectivity between the Provider and any private cloud or on-premises environments is properly secured. Customer must validate that all segmentation controls utilized are effective and properly isolate the CDE within all environments of the mixed/hybrid platform.

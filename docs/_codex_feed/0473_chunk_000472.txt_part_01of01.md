Value Clearing System (HVCS) Framework Participants (Participants) to ensure the continuity of orderly clearing and settlement in the event that either: • a Participant experiences a Disabling Event that prevents it from sending HVCS payments in the normal way; or • the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) experiences a Disabling Event that prevents the Reserve Bank Information and Transfer System (RITS) from settling HVCS payments in the normal way. • Participants must comply with the instructions set out in this document. 1.1 Relationship with other documents Document Relationship / Purpose Owner HVCS Contingency Industry Test Strategy The high-level strategy for testing HVCS contingency arrangements. AusPayNet HVCS Contingency Industry Test Plan The detailed test plan for industry contingency test exercises. A test plan is produced for each annual test. AusPayNet HVCS Exchange Summary Form A summary document substantially in the form of Appendix G in a format prescribed by the RBA. Used by a Framework Participant to submit its net bilateral obligations with each of its counterparties to the RBA for net settlement the next day. RBA HVCS Bilateral Clearing Form A document in a format prescribed by AusPayNet used by an Affected Participant to send HVCS payments to another Framework Participant. AusPayNet RITS Member Contingency Procedures (MCP) High-level procedures to be followed by RITS Members if a contingency disrupts the efficient operation of RITS or the Fast Settlement Service (FSS) over an extended period.

The Contingency Instructions are intended to set a baseline of operational requirements and expectations among Participants to ensure the continuity of HVCS payments during a HVCS Fallback Period or a Participant Fallback Period. 469 Inserted effective 19/7/21, version 039 r&p 001.21 HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 131 2.1 Applicable Scenarios 2.1.1 RITS Outage This is a period during which the RBA is experiencing a Disabling Event that prevents RITS from effecting settlement of HVCS payments in the normal way. The scenario would be such that the RBA has ruled out the possibility to resolve the Disabling Event in time to complete settlement of HVCS payments in the normal way on that day. Where this occurs, AusPayNet, after consultation with the RBA, can declare a HVCS Fallback Period during which the HVCS Fallback Solution will be used to enable same-day clearing to occur, with settlement deferred to the next business day. The HVCS Fallback Solution comprises: Fallback Clearing Same-day clearing through the SWIFT PDS in T-Copy Mode. Fallback Settlement Deferred (next-day) multilateral net settlement using data submitted to the RBA from Participants in HVCS Exchange Summary Form spreadsheets. 2.1.2 Participant Outage This is a period during which a Participant is experiencing a Disabling Event that prevents that Participant from sending HVCS payments in the normal way. The scenario would be such that the Affected Participant, in consultation with AusPayNet and the RBA, is not confident that the Disabling Event can be resolved in time to send any payments deemed urgent by the Affected Participant before the RITS cut-off times. Where this occurs, AusPayNet can declare a Participant Fallback Period during which the Participant Fallback Solution can be used to enable same-day clearing of the Affected Participants outbound HVCS payments to continue, with settlement of the net bilateral obligations occurring on the same day via RITS Cash Transfers. The Participant Fallback Solution comprises: Fallback Clearing Outbound payments: Clearing information sent from the Affected Participant to each Receiver using the HVCS Bilateral Clearing Form. Note that inbound payments will continue to be sent to the Affected Participant through the SWIFT PDS in the normal way. Fallback Settlement Outbound payments: Deferred (same-day) bilateral net settlement using RITS Cash Transfers. Note that the settlement of inbound payments received by RITS through the SWIFT PDS feeder will be effected in the normal way (RTGS). 2.1.3 Out of Scope Arrangements for the following Contingency scenarios are outside the scope of these Contingency Instructions: • Disabling Events occurring at the Participant, RITS or CSI level that can be resolved on the same day, within the checkpoint times outlined in the RITS Outage Runsheet and Participant Outage Runsheet contained in these Contingency Instructions. • Contingency arrangements for a Disabling Event at the SWIFT Network level. HIGH VALUE CLEARING SYSTEM PROCEDURES ANNEXURE J: CONTINGENCY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIGH VALUES CLEARING SYSTEM (CS4) Australian Payments Network Limited [ABN 12 055 136 519] 132 • Contingency arrangements for HVCS payments to or from CLS Bank. During a RITS Outage, Participants must not send payments to CLS Bank using the HVCS Fallback Solution. A CLS AUD holiday could be declared in such circumstances, in accordance with the CLS Bank’s own contingency procedures. • 2.2 Document Structure • The Contingency Instructions for each of the two outage scenarios are divided into the following sections: Section Description Runsheets Checkpoint times and sequence of events for declaring a Fallback Period and using the Fallback Solution Instructions Operational Readiness: Pre-requisites and

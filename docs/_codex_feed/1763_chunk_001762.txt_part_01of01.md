AP+ continually seeks ways to better understand the needs of payment users. Our most recent End User Forum was held on 31 October 2024 to gain insights on the future of payments for Australia. Our End User Forums are an opportunity for end users to share their thoughts with us directly on the issues that matter most to them. We had great participation at the forum, which took place in Melbourne for the first time to enable us to gauge the views of Victorian based end users. Our CEO, Lynn Kraus acted as MC for the afternoon and provided a business update on AP+, our purpose, purpose pillars and how we are delivering on our strategic priorities.

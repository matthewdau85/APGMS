limited to less than 24 hours. To strengthen your authentication, we recommend implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) as best practice. This can be applied as per Australian Government - Guidelines for system hardening. MFA should not include social media logins. If social media applications are included in the proposed business model, DSPs should discuss this with the DPO. Certification Mandatory: Self-assessment against one of the following: ISM ISO / IEC 27001 ISO / IEC 27002 ISO / IEC 27017 SOC2 OWASP ASVS 3.0 or later NIST Data hosting Mandatory*: If the product provides any element of data hosting it must be onshore by default. Offshore hosting arrangements, including redundant systems are managed by exception only. Encryption Key Management Mandatory*: If the product manages Encryption key management and public key infrastructure (PKI) policy must include asymmetric or public key algorithms, hashing algorithms and symmetric algorithms as per Australian Government - Guidelines for using cryptography Encryption at Rest Mandatory*: DSPs should apply encryption at the disk, container, application or database level. Encryption at rest should follow Australian Government - Guidelines for using cryptography Encryption in Transit Mandatory: Encryption in transit must use endorsed approved cryptographic protocol, with a minimum TLS 1.3 as per Australian Government - Guidelines for using cryptography Entity validation Mandatory: DSPs must implement entity validation to ensure consumers/users of a commercial software product are legitimate businesses and have a genuine need to access our APIs. Personnel security Mandatory: Personnel security procedures must be in place for hiring, managing and terminating employees including contractors. Security monitoring Mandatory*: If the product can relay data to the DSP, security monitoring must be implemented to enable DSPs to scan environmental threats and take action. Supply chain Mandatory: DSPs must provide us with an overview of their supply chain and third-party add-ons. Third party add-on Mandatory*: If DSPs integrate with third party add-ons via an API, they must take reasonable care to ensure appropriate security controls are in place for any add-on partners. We recommend using the security standards for add-on marketplaces or an equivalent set of controls. Commercial products or in house developers Services include desktop and server-based software, where the application is under the control of the client. Requirements Category E NA Commercial product or service controlled by the DSP or the client, and No risk APIs regardless of unique client records OR In-House developer controlled by the client and Low Risk APIs only with less than 10,000 unique client records, or No risk APIs regardless of unique client records Note: ATO recognise DSPs (including in-house developers) may have some level of control of the requirement, the mandatory element applies where a DSP has control to implement a solution. Some controls may not be applicable Authentication Mandatory: At a minimum, all solutions must have user-based access, including unique client logins with authentication and authorisation controls implemented, for example, unique username and password. Shared logins are not permitted and must be blocked by the DSP. Remember me functionality must be limited to less than 24 hours.

PCI Security Standards Council Bulletin: Extension of Expiration of the PCI PTS POI v6 Security Requirements 3 April 2024 The PTS POI v6 Security Requirements are scheduled to be retired from use for new device approvals on 30 June 2024. Without modification, there would be no evaluations that result in a new approval number using these requirements after 30 June 2024. PCI SSC will continue to provide a 12-month overlap period between major versions of PTS security requirements. This allows PTS vendors time to adjust their product designs to facilitate meeting the updated security requirements. The PTS POI v6 Security Requirements usage for new device security approvals will be extended to 30 June 2025. The PTS POI v6 approval expiry date will also be extended 12 months from the current device approval expiry of April 2030 to April 2031. The development process for PTS POI v7 will commence soon. The exact expiration timing for both the PTS POI v6 security requirements and for PTS POI v6 approvals will be determined upon the actual publication date of PTS POI v7. ###

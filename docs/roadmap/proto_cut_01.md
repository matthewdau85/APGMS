# Proto Cut 01 Roadmap

## Objective
Increase proto launch readiness from **3/10** to approximately **5.5/10** over a two-week execution window by hardening critical systems, validating monetization pathways, and preparing operational playbooks.

## Guiding Principles
- Prioritize idempotent, observable workflows so that each deployment is safe to retry.
- Pair delivery milestones with validation artifacts (tests, audits, sign-offs) to ensure readiness sticks.
- Maintain cross-functional alignment through daily checkpoints and demoable progress.

## Timeline & Milestones
| Day | Milestone | Key Activities | Owner(s) | Exit Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D0 | Kickoff & Planning | Confirm scope, owners, and environments. Baseline readiness scorecard at 3/10. | Eng, PM, Ops | Plan approved, comms cadence scheduled. |
| D3 | Idempotency + Money Audit in CI green | Harden retry logic for critical jobs, ensure CI pipelines validate idempotency. Automate revenue recognition audit checks in CI. | Eng | Automated suites pass; CI gate blocks merges failing idempotency/money audit. |
| D5 | State Machine constraints + Golden pack v1 | Lock state transitions with guardrails; produce first golden dataset pack for regression runs. | Eng, QA | State machine schema merged; golden pack stored with checksum and replay docs. |
| D7 | RPT v0.1 end-to-end signed | Deliver Reporting Pipeline Tool v0.1, run end-to-end validation with stakeholders. | Eng, Data, PM | Stakeholder sign-off recorded; RPT outputs match golden pack tolerances. |
| D9 | Recon ingest + matching rules | Stand up reconciliation ingest path and deterministic matching rules. | Eng, Finance | Recon jobs ingest sample data; matching accuracy ≥95% on golden pack. |
| D12 | Operator UI queues + basic a11y | Implement operator queues with accessible navigation, screen reader labels, and contrast checks. | Eng, Design | Accessibility smoke test passes; queue SLAs monitored. |
| D14 | Threat model + dashboards + demo script | Complete lightweight threat model, ship readiness dashboards, and finalize demo narrative. | Eng, Sec, PM | Threat model reviewed; dashboards live; scripted demo ready for leadership review. |

## Workstreams
### Platform Reliability
- Codify idempotent execution patterns and include rollback hooks per deployment.
- Expand telemetry coverage and funnel critical metrics into readiness dashboards (D14).

### Financial Integrity
- Integrate money audit assertions into CI with blocking checks (D3).
- Finalize reconciliation ingest and matching logic with Finance partnership (D9).

### Experience & Operations
- Develop golden regression pack for QA (D5) and run through RPT end-to-end validation (D7).
- Deliver operator UI enhancements and ensure foundational accessibility compliance (D12).

### Risk & Communication
- Threat modeling sessions culminate in tracked mitigations and dashboard alerts (D14).
- Maintain demo script aligning narrative to readiness score improvements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Readiness scorecard reflects ≥5.5/10 with supporting evidence from audits, validations, and dashboards.
- All milestones documented with owner sign-offs and linked artifacts.
- Runbooks updated with rollback notes for new functionality prior to launch review.

## Test Plan
- Daily CI runs covering idempotency, money audit, and regression pack replay.
- Scheduled dry-runs for RPT v0.1 and operator workflows with stakeholder feedback captured.
- Accessibility smoke tests using automated tooling plus manual keyboard navigation checks.

## Rollback Notes
- Maintain feature toggles for new workflows; ensure toggles have documented rollback paths.
- Preserve prior stable golden pack snapshots for quick reversion if regression is detected.
- Document rollback procedures for operator UI changes and reconciliation pipelines within associated runbooks.
